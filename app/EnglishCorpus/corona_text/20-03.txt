Especially if you 've heard a lot of promises from people like me over the years , and we had a long and well-documented history of failure ? <p> This is what puzzles me about Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , whose presidential campaign consists largely of promises he can not reasonably be expected to fulfill . Are we so inured to the idea of politicians laying out goals they can not achieve that we just shrug this stuff off ? Or are Sanders ' supporters the Charlie Browns of the electorate , ignoring the footballs yanked away in the past and counting on a completely different result this time ? <p> Even President Trump , who often claims to be the one chief executive who actually kept his campaign promises , has failed to live up to much of what he pledged . The economy is n't growing at even 3% per year , let alone the 4% and higher rates he touted on the campaign trail .

And on and on . <p> ( OK , U.S. forces did help eliminate the Islamic State caliphate on his watch , and , with Congress ' help , he has cut regulations and taxes . So put those in the " promises kept " column . ) <p> You could argue that Sanders ' promises are merely directional signals to the electorate . When he talks about " Medicare for All , " free college for all , a guaranteed job for all , free child care for all and the like , he 's saying , " This is the kind of country I want to build , " not , " This is what you can expect from four years of President Sanders . " <p> But that 's not how Sanders has been framing these positions . For example , his website introduces each element of his platform with the boldfaced phrase , " When Bernie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a statement like this : " Pass the College for All Act to provide at least $48 billion per year to eliminate tuition and fees at four-year public colleges and universities , tribal colleges , community colleges , trade schools and apprenticeship programs . Everyone deserves the right to a good higher education if they choose to pursue it , no matter their income . " <p> He was similarly declarative at Tuesday night 's debate in South Carolina . For example , on the topic of education , Sanders said , " We are going to triple funding for low-income Title I schools , because kids ' education should not depend upon the ZIP code in which they live . We 're going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free through a tax on Wall Street speculation . And we 're going to move to make certain that no teacher in America earns less than $60,000 a year . " <p> That 's not just a direction , that 's a destination . And without a more sweeping change in Congress than any election analyst thinks is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate -- it 's a destination that Sanders can not possibly reach . That 's because the vast majority of Sanders ' plans involve new or additional spending as well as new statutes , which means he would need a willing partner in Congress . <p> At Tuesday 's debate , some of Sanders ' rivals for the Democratic nomination finally started to call him on that . <p> Take this critique from Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D-Minn. ) , who said the total cost of Sanders ' proposals would be $60 trillion ( that 's CNN 's number , and it 's a projected 10-year cost ) . " That is three times the American economy -- not the federal government -- the entire American economy , " Klobuchar said , adding that the American people " are not with you on spending nearly $60 trillion .

I 'm not arguing in favor of the status quo ; I 'm arguing against Sanders selling a quixotic vision as an achievable one . <p> Klobuchar put it most clearly Tuesday , as she discussed her approach to health care vs . Sanders ' Medicare for All plan . " What I think we should do is make things more affordable , ( add a ) nonprofit public option , make sure we 're paying for long-term care better , take on the pharmaceuticals , like you and I have done together , and do something for the people of America , " she said to Sanders , " instead of a bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers .

" That 's why , she say , " we 're trying really hard to prevent it from getting a toehold here in the States . " <p> In an effort to contain the spread , patients at Sacred Heart Medical Center are in special isolation rooms designed to prevent the virus from escaping . <p> " All the air is sanitized before being exhausted out , " says Compton-Phillips , " so that germs can not go from being in the room , through a vent system into the rest of the hospital , or out into the air of the community . " <p> This building at University of Nebraska Medical Center/Nebraska Health in Omaha has 41 isolation beds , some now used to treat patients who have COVID-19 .

These patients , too , are being cared for in isolation rooms with special ventilation systems . <p> UNMC has a total of 41 beds to isolate patients . That wo n't be enough to treat every severely ill patient if the virus spreads dramatically , Schwedhelm says . <p> " If this virus becomes a virus of pandemic potential , every health system , every organization is going to need to be all in , " she says , adding that the health care workers at her hospital , for that reason , are working hard right now to equip their counterparts at other hospitals . <p> They are " doing a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says -- " starting to prepare for that scenario , should it evolve .

A total of 500 participants took part in the educational event . <p> Schwedhelm and a physician colleague told participants to " do the best that you can and use the resources that you have available in terms of an airborne isolation room -- but , if not , do the best that you can , and that is probably going to be good enough in most cases .

Such shortages would be likely in a bigger outbreak , says Compton-Phillips of Sacred Heart , since the gear has to be thrown out after use . <p> " The first patient we had -- when he was doing well , it took about six changes a day per shift for nurses and caregivers to take on and take off , as they were caring for that person , she says .

His organization is working with local health departments to help ensure they know what to look for and how to report suspected cases . On top of all this , he says " we are working with our community partners to disseminate credible information , calm fears and dispel myths . " <p> But public health in general is chronically underfunded , he notes . <p> For example , hospitals have an immediate , and ongoing , need for epidemiologists at the local level who can help with contact tracing and monitoring , he says .

Follow these 3 tips <p> If you have been thinking twice about traveling anywhere during the global spread of novel coronavirus , you 're not alone . <p> After top U.S. health officials warned last week that the spread of COVID-19 " might be bad , " many Americans began to ponder whether it was safe to take upcoming vacations and work trips . Since then , cases have cropped up in Washington state , New York , Oregon , Rhode Island and California -- some of which are linked to travel . Governments , companies and institutions have also taken new actions to limit the spread of the illness . <p> Italy , South Korea and Iran were added to the U.S. 's list of places to avoid nonessential travel . A month ago , just as the public was learning about the virus , the State Department warned travelers not to go to China . <p> Chances are your own travel plans may be up in the air , due to the virus . So should you cancel those nonrefundable plane tickets ? The PBS NewsHour asked public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> The link between travel and COVID-19 <p> Many Americans have begun to prepare for long-term closures and shortages due to the disruptions caused by COVID-19 . It 's important to think about travel plans the same way , said Dr. Amesh Adalja , a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security . <p> On Jan. 30 , the World Health Organization issued a public health emergency of international concern about this new coronavirus , a member of the same family of viruses as the common cold , SARS and MERS . Since then , COVID-19 has sickened about 90,000 people , and roughly 3,000 people have died . More than 90 percent of people around the world who have gotten sick or died from the virus resided in China , where it originated . <p> In the U.S. , fewer than a dozen people have caught the illness as a result of community transmission -- not after traveling to affected areas or being in close contact with someone sick with a confirmed case -- - meaning it is practically impossible right now to trace how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of the U.S. cases were in people who had either traveled to China or lived in close contact with people who got sick after traveling .

" <p> Travel has helped to perpetuate the virus , said Ian Lipkin , an epidemiologist who directs Columbia University 's Center for Infection and Immunity , because when individuals " who are infected then travel to a new site " they " create a nucleus " from which new cases emerge . <p> The travel industry hopes spring 's arrival will encourage the virus to subside , McGehee said . But public health officials have warned it is too soon to know how this illness will behave . <p> After the 2003 SARS outbreak , which was not as virulent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry lost billions of dollars and took three years to rebound , said Nancy McGehee , a professor of hospitality and tourism management at Virginia Tech University . For the current health emergency , she compared projected tourism and travel industry losses to those felt in 2009 during the Great Recession . Restaurants , hotels and tourist destinations will certainly feel the pinch , and retail stores will also be caught in the virus ' ripple effects , McGehee said . <p> " Many American travelers are canceling international travel , not only because of fear of coronavirus , but because of the potential for either getting stuck out of the country or being a burden on the systems of other countries , " she said . <h> Taking smart precautions <p> Now , the most important thing is to remain flexible when it comes to travel , Lipkin said . <p> Few people in the U.S. are known to have been exposed to the virus , so " it 's really important to react appropriately , but not overreact , " said Tori Emerson Barnes , executive vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an industry lobbying group . <p> " The government has put forth really good guidance , " Barnes said , urging " folks to use best hygiene practices that we should be using anyway " to prevent the virus ' hold from tightening . That way , she said people can help " ensure the American public remains healthy but recognize they can continue about their daily lives and travel around the U.S. " <p> Traveling during an emerging public health crisis boils down to an individual decision , McGehee said . <p> When making their calculation to hit the road , fly or sail , McGehee encouraged the public to heed the following advice : <p> What are public health officials saying ? Pay attention to guidance from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

But still , bad news is even worse news two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> National will be able to dig right in with its tried and tested attack line that " the left " ca n't manage the economy . <p> Its pre-coronavirus focus on supporting small to medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) with fewer minimum wage rises and less red tape for example , will also get a platform , as SMEs risk being disproportionately affected by an economic downturn . <p> National on Thursday came out suggesting the Government gives coronavirus-affected SMEs wage subsidies like those it provided after the Canterbury and Kaikoura earthquakes . <p> After the Kaikoura quake for example , sole traders and SMEs who could n't operate or had to operate at a reduced capacity could receive up to $500 a week for full-time employees and $300 a week for part-timers for up to eight weeks . <p> National 's approach earlier in the week was to say the Government would be better placed to respond to coronavirus had it maintained higher rates of GDP growth - a flimsy argument . <p> Its tactic seemed even more misguided when it said its proposed ( but yet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stimulate the economy in the face of coronavirus , even though this would n't be a direct fiscal emergency response and would n't help those without an income - perhaps due to coronavirus . <p> The trouble National faces is that going to town , criticising the Government 's response to coronavirus , particularly on the health front , risks being perceived as unproductive and even destructive . <p> If it erodes public confidence in authorities to the point this creates panic ( it has already been accused of encouraging panic shopping ) it 'll be slammed for putting its political interests ahead of the country 's . <p> National needs the firing range to be cleared of coronavirus , so it can take clean shots at the Government for breaking key promises on KiwiBuild and Auckland light rail , and in some instances , letting ideology rather than evidence drive policy . Pre-coronavirus it was starting to gather momentum and do a good job of this . <p> Coronavirus is now giving some under-performing government ministers a ' get out of jail free ' card . <p> Greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NZ First will struggle as much as National to get airtime to differentiate themselves from the Coalition Government to solidify their support bases . <p> With National polling strongly and NZ First below 5% , it 's in Labour 's interest for NZ First to reconnect with its voters . <p> But the view expressedin February that neither minor party can go so far as to making the Coalition Government look dysfunctional to the point it 's unelectable , rings even more true as the country needs a united government to lead us through an epidemic . <p> Election 2020 was always expected to follow the international trend and be fought on the personalities of party leaders . Coronavirus will only exacerbate this . <p> The more people tune in to Ardern delivering both bad news and messages of hope on their screens , the more they 'll be thinking , " Would I prefer to be looking at Simon Bridges right now ? " <p> If preferred prime minister poll results are anything to go by , the answer in most cases will be , no . <p> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embody a competent government during what will be a long six months of relentless negativity . <p> We welcome your help to improve our coverage of this issue .

Our current comment policy is here . <h> 88 Comments <h> Comment Filter <p> It is of my opinion that the NZ political arena lacks acumen , regardless of which party or political colors you 've hitched your wagon to . I do n't blame the people ( who have many talents of their own ) , but really the manner in which our ruling elite 's institutions are structured . The negativity is a making of the ruling elite 's own , particularly on the economic front . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the economic profile of NZ has some serious issues . That all seems to be coming to a head now with externalities . The ruling elite , from politicians to central bankers to beauracrats and even to corporate leaders , have managed to sugar coat performance and deflect any real serious debate and action towards shortcomings . If you have read Sun Tzu 's ' The Art of War ' , it should be no surprise that they 're in this predicament . And unfortunately , the general public has been herded away from critical thought ( thank you NewsTalk ZB , etc ) so the ability to get any clarity of thought among them is seemingly impossible . <p> A technocratic approach to government ( at all levels ) is essentially about voter suppression and keeping the plebs and populists away from the levers of power . By controlling the narrative and reducing opportunities for debate , accountability and leadership is replaced with a managerial approach / rigidly defined systems and processes that prioritise protecting the politicians and technocrats over delivering the outcome ( or rather , replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same generally applies to NZ managerial approach to running businesses . <p> An obvious symptom of this is the ratio of journos to flacks in NZ , reportedly being 1-10 . Apparently PR is the highest growth area of government employment . Sugar coating is new new productivity .... <p> Sums it up entirely . Despite the freedoms that the internet has given us for expression , it has also come with something more Orwellian in terms of how we 're controlled . Case in point : How long ago were Australia and NZ labelled the ' rock star economies ' ? People suck up that self affirmation , however hollow it might be . Also notice how publications like Granny Herald publish rankings featuring NZ . This is also a tactic to convince the people how great everything is . Not to say it some of it is n't deserved and something to be proud of . But it 's more about emotional gratifcation than anything else . <p> On balance , NZ has done pretty well so far at keeping the coronavirus under control with very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 34 cases . So it 's worth taking a look at global update maps to get things in perspective and realize that we 're going much better then most . <p> No they have n't done well , we 're just lucky and expensive to get to . This new case is really poor : its taken them two days to confirm the husband of case 2 is also infected and disclose he went to the Tool concert a week ago ( anyone he infected will now likely be infectious ) . Ashley Bloomfield , our Director-General of Health , is doing minimal testing for some reason we can only speculate on . He refuses to test obvious cases despite having capacity to do so . While the media will cover for Labour , I 'm not sure they will be forgiven if they get the blame for any of these known cases becoming outbreaks in time for the election . <p> On balance at least they were able to find and test them here . Now compare that case to the US and Trumps bumblings . Trump has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test kits and the number of cases is rapidly escalating , so much so they 've had to declare a state of emergency in some states . BBC article : Coronavirus : White House concedes US lacks enough test kitshttps : **35;5205;TOOLONG ... I was in a room with 2 people today that had 2 degrees of separation from a confirmed case . I suggested we are all getting it since we are n't wuhan locked down yet and we just needed to be grateful we were not in the high risk age/health groups . <p> I 'll give you that there are n't many countries actually trying stop the coronavirus from becoming endemic ( the USA is not on this list ) , as opposed to the doing minimum required to achieve plausible deniability that they did not chose their economies over public health . But I 'll argue that we have some of the the most defensible boarders for a pandemic and according to a poll there is broad public support for further restrictions so it would make sense to pull out all the stops like Singapore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your performance against the US and Europe who never tried to stop the spread . <p> when you reach the election booth it will come down to ardern or bridges , and much like the democratic US election where it came down to anybody but sanders , folks will choose accordingly.Simo is too Sino for a lot of us . <p> Maybe not the best choice of words , sorry about that . Calling a spade a spade though . Tough times , call for a tough leader . Come on , lets call it , she has been out of depth since the start and it has just got 10 times worse . Jacinda calls for calm , public reaction panic buying . Very few have any trust in her . <p> If I thought the Nats had a decent housing policy I might consider voting for them . Not with standing J Collin 's being " ethically compromised " one is between a rock and a hard place as she is the housing spokesperson and a potential leader and wo n't be leaving parliament any time soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I call them Gnats because they 're actively selling out the country to CCP . They 're basically traitors . IF they at least showed the intent of doing something good for the country ( not just their top 1% buddies ) , I 'd show more respect . <p> ' To start with Labour , coronavirus is giving the party 's greatest asset - Jacinda Ardern - a platform to demonstrate leadership - a skill she proved her mastery of in the aftermath of the March 15 mosque terror attacks . ' <p> That proved her public leadership and empathy , certainly . But I still have plenty of misgivings about her general political leadership . The buck stops with her and her leadership , and the government has failed in many policy areas . <p> As the articial says , she 's ca n't do it herself , she needs her ministers to step up . They did n't manage to get theor house in order when we were in the good times , so in the tough going .. no chance . Helen Clark could handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that standing . <p> 6 months to go and the PM has got the ability to carry it , the campaign that is . To my my mind she is a sincere lady , a good person underneath it all . You need very thick armour to survive in the world of politics if you are of that ilk . Perhaps she will not stay on after the election , citing family and other values . Who could blame her . But the problem for Labour that will emerge is the possibility of a Labour &amp; Greens only government , which the voting public of NZ will undoubtedly see as an alarming prospect ; Labour itself too probably . For if a government is formed as such , and the Greens come full on out of left field , the nation will soon be in an uproar . Labour would bear the negativity and stigma of that for years to come . <p> I quite like the idea of a Lab Green coalition . Maybe then shit will get done re . the environment and living standards for the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing is driving inequality , eroding the kiwi egalitarian dream , and denying environmental issues to support their big business buddies , they will look to the left for leadership . <p> Hugs and headscarves are n't enough when real leadership is required . The worse the virus gets the poorer Labour 's image will become . They have already fluffed the best chance we had of keeping it out . " Too little , too late " is their mantra . <p> Or we could see a brave media peering ahead at what New Zealand is inevitably going to traverse this next decade , and have a mature public discussion about what would be best , in that light . <p> Nah - why would we do that ? Let 's pretend that growth is forever , adding words like ' good ' and ' solid ' and ' normal ' while pretending to be all-seeing . Then lets report public-opinion polls , having kept said public in the dark - a self-justifying Catch-22 . <p> Jeanette Fitzsimons got the big picture - notice the nine-to-noon front Ryan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Ryan is n't the only one to have stuff put clearly under her nose ......... <p> Limits to Growth , placement along said trajectory and what to do about it . The only game in town . How long , how long ( to mangle Kipling ) <p> @PDK I agree , we need to undertake some serious scenario planning , for a future unknown , and to be honest we have been good at long -term planning in some areas . <p> Take Fibre-to-the-door for instance , what a stroke of brilliance <p> Or the National cycleway which some asked me about in the US when I was on holiday there <p> Kiwisaver .. good example of starting to wean us off the Nanny <p> We have not planned inward immigration well , we have not planned Auckland 's growth well , and we have not spent enough on getting our roads up to 18th Century standards , but this all creates HUGE opportunity . <p> @Masher , she does not make me feel good at all .............

Head of the Bottomless Pit Ministry , throwing endless money at run down provinces with no prospect of ever getting a return <p> What on earth , Jenee , do you imagine ' love , hope and global leadership ' mean in any political context ? These - at least the first two - are religious values . And I seriously doubt the existence of the supposed third quality attributed to Ardern . Where , would you say , you see evidence of it ? What redirection or new clarity of direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her perceived ' leadership ' ? <p> What New Zealand needs of its Prime Minister and government is not a set of admirable intangibles - things we may or may not feel - but the deliberate and measurable ability to deal with tangibles here and now . Yes , coronavirus is a very serious challenge , but it joins promises and failures in a host of areas : burst infrastructure , homelessness , poverty , an immigration shambles , taxation inequities , educational slippage , etc . Personality - and I 'm no judge of Ardern 's - does n't come into it . We need to see achievement . And , so far as coronavirus is concerned , we need to see firm direction and achievement across multiple sectors of concern urgently . <p> Crises expose the weak and reveal the strong . Right now , I would say , we do n't know which will be the certain , undeniable , actuality of this administration , when put under truly intense pressure . <p> Lol You must be living under a rock if you have n't seen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one example ' The Christchurch Call ' https : **39;5242;TOOLONG ... and here is another quote from Time Magazine " But Ardern 's deft and quietly revolutionary management of these crises , especially the Christchurch shootings , got noticed around the globe . Her gender and youth ( she 's 39 ) were always going to make her stand out in a field dominated mainly by old gray men . Those attributes , however , are just the wrapping . Ardern 's real gift is her ability to articulate a form of leadership that embodies strength and sanity , while also pushing an agenda of compassion and community -- or , as she would put it , " pragmatic idealism . " https : **39;5283;TOOLONG ... Steve1 , I 've seen and read plenty of this kind of hagiography . It 's journalism as wish-fulfillment . It leaves my questions unanswered . Where do you see evidence of such ' global leadership ' ? What redirection or new clarity of direction do you see on ' the globe ' resulting from her ' leadership ' ? These claims are easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globe that has been affected in any tangible sense by Ardern 's supposed ' global leadership ' . What has changed that you can attribute to Ardern ? In Australia ? the UK ? EU ? US ? China ? SE Asia ? Africa ? the UN ? Where ? Do people around the world ' feel ' better ? Fight less ? Do things differently ? Have higher motivations ? Are they more empathetic ? Less misogynistic ? What ? I do n't dislike her . I wish her well . But I want to see some justification for such a vast abstraction as ' global leadership ' . It 's meaningless , a distraction from fact . More than this , I want to see action here in New Zealand . <p> Deft and adept sound-bite politics . That is what gets people to vote for a politician or a political party . Real policies and excellent management , well , sadly these do not win votes . <p> I especially like the headline of this article . Until the last few weeks of the prior election , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badger Little got pushed aside and we had the " relentlessly positive " replacement . Substantive policy , who cares ? We want pretty sound bit politics ! <p> The economy , prior to the advent of COVID-19 , was at a growth level of less than half of the assumed economic growth that Labour had used for their fiscal projections prior to their election . Nobody has ever called them on this ... okay , maybe somebody did , but got catcalled off of the stage . Personally , I would rather plan for a sustainable economy rather than a growth economy , but using that as a plan is political suicide . Hence , the Labour PREFU plans assuming 5% GDP growth per year after they were elected . <p> The election should be about policy and policy execution . Jenee is instead arguing that it should be about fluffy bunnies and sound bites . One day I hope to live in a country that votes in an informed manner about policy and competency to conduct policy ... <p> Well said , Yankiwi . The greatest substantive choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CCP influence and interference in our politics . And on this choice hangs our environmental well-being ; the value we place on our citizens/residents owning New Zealand 's land , property , and other assets ; the trust we can place in any politician or party ; and - just perhaps - some vague attempt at a decently functioning society . <p> I look forward to seeing the birth of a party that espouses these concepts . At present , the two primary parties appear to have similar actions in regards to nationalism vs globalism . One may be a bit more transparent in regards to globalism , the other shows its real policy via action as compared to words . The environmental well-being idea , sadly we do not yet have a viable party that supports this concept . The green party could have been this party , but was co-opted long ago to become more of a socialist party rather than a sustainable environmentalist party . I have to laugh quite loudly about one of the two co-leaders on the green party having six tamariki , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to be anything close to supporting a sustainable environment . <p> Time is not what it was . 77% of readership is in the USA .

The world is foolishly making plans based on trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die as a result . <p> My prediction is that when the scale of lying is discovered by the world , the deaths will be blamed on China and they will become a pariah state - and probably lose most of their offshore assets to fines and that will be the end of the current politburo - they will be overthrown by underlings . <p> I doubt that it would ever come to such drastic measures . Politicians do n't like change . They 're trying to maintain the status quo , and they 'll do everything in their power to " return to the norm " once the current crisis is behind us . Back to business as usual , reinflating the bubble even faster than previously . <p> xmw in the last half of the 13th century a divine wind put paid to your ancestors catastrophically , and twice .

Cracks in the good times end up as bloody big holes in the tough times . Jacinda must deliver a massive shake up from now on to manage this as her actions to present have been down to luck . <p> The nurses ' union , New Zealand Nurses Organisation , said staff were becoming increasingly anxious about their safety and how well prepared district health boards were to handle the illness . <p> NZNO associate professional services manager Hilary Graham-Smith said the union had experienced an increase in concerns raised by nurses in recent days , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> That was the plan , but who would want to come to a wedding during an epidemic , and who would be stupid enough to have a baby when hosptials are overwhelmed with people dying from wuflu <p> I du n no maybe someone desperate enough for another term ? She is actually behaving like Helen did in 2005 . Winston was out of control and Helen refused to condem him . She even passed a law and applied it retrospectively to get him off . I would not put it past Jacinda to use similar tactics . <p> Wow this Coronavirus has created the perfect storm . The timing is almost perfect to decide the election outcome . Labour was guaranteed a win if they had kept it out by very strong and decisive action and they failed . The case numbers will now be on an exponential trajectory containing this is impossible so in a couple of months its going to go ballistic . Sorry but the COL get the blame for this and rightly so . Sorry Jacinta there was no time to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one .

The Last government certainly was no spend . Drove services into the ground , sold assets or in the case of Solid Energy used as a cash cow . Thankfully that govt no longer exists . BUT look at the ragtag idiots who are out there now who think they have some right to that corrupt legacy . The new generation of morally absence and able to be purchased for any price .
@@31692741 <h> Abstract <p> The Food and Drug Administration recently approved the use of palivizumab ( pale-vizhu-m ? b ) , an intramuscularly administered monoclonal antibody preparation . Recommendations for its use are based on a large , randomized study demonstrating a 55% reduction in the risk of hospitalization attributable to respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) infections in high-risk pediatric patients . Infants and children with chronic lung disease ( CLD ) , formerly designated bronchopulmonary dysplasia , as well as prematurely born infants without CLD experienced a reduced number of hospitalizations while receiving palivizumab compared with a placebo . Both palivizumab and respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous ( RSV-IGIV ) are available for protecting high-risk children against serious complications from RSV infections . Palivizumab is preferred for most high-risk children because of ease of administration ( intramuscular ) , lack of interference with measles -- mumps -- rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine , and lack of complications associated with intravenous administration of human immune globulin products . RSV-IGIV , however , provides additional protection against other respiratory viral illnesses and may be preferred for selected high-risk children including those receiving replacement intravenous immune globulin because of underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infants about to be discharged from hospitals during the RSV season , physicians could consider administering RSV-IGIV for the first month of prophylaxis . <p> Most of the guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics for the selection of infants and children to receive RSV-prophylaxis remain unchanged . Palivizumab has been shown to provide benefit for infants who were 32 to 35 weeks of gestation at birth . RSV-IGIV is contraindicated and palivizumab is not recommended for children with cyanotic congenital heart disease . The number of patients with adverse events judged to be related to palivizumab was similar to that of the placebo group ( 11% vs 10% , respectively ) ; discontinuation of injections for adverse events related to palivizumab was rare . <p> Abbreviations : <p> RSV = <p> respiratory syncytial virus * <p> CLD = <p> chronic lung disease * <p> FDA = <p> Food and Drug Administration * <p> CHD = <p> congenital heart disease * <p> RSV-IGIV = <p> respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous * <p> AAP = <p> American Academy of Pediatrics * <p> ICU = <p> intensive care unit * <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IPV = <p> inactivated poliovirus vaccine * <p> OPV = <p> oral poliovirus vaccine * <p> IGIV = <p> immune globulin intravenous <p> Prophylaxis to prevent respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) infection in infants and children at increased risk for severe disease , particularly those with chronic lung disease ( CLD ) receiving medical management on a long-term basis , is now available using either an intravenous or an intramuscular preparation . Choosing which product to use in individual patients will depend on age , availability of intravenous access , cost , and other factors . Neither preparation is approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for infants or children with congenital heart disease ( CHD ) . Unlike respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous ( RSV-IGIV ) , recipients of palivizumab do not require delaying measles-containing vaccine or varicella vaccine . <h> BACKGROUND <p> RSV-IGIV ( RespiGam , Massachusetts Public Health Biologic Laboratories , and MedImmune , Inc , Gaithersburg , MD ) was licensed by the FDA in January 1996 for prevention of severe RSV lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth ( =35 weeks of gestation ) . Recommendations for the use of this product have been summarized previously by the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) .1 Randomized , controlled clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy and safety of monthly RSV-IGIV infusions in selected infants.2,3 Although RSV-IGIV was the first agent with demonstrated efficacy for prophylaxis against RSV infections , and did provide a 41% reduction in RSV hospitalizations , several disadvantages are associated with this product . On the basis of available clinical trials , the safety and efficacy of RSV-IGIV in children with CHD has not been established . Children with cyanotic CHD who received RSV-IGIV and underwent cardiac surgery appeared to experience an increased surgical mortality rate.4 RSV-IGIV prophylaxis requires monthly intravenous infusion throughout the RSV season , and like palivizumab is costly.5 Also , a widespread shortage of RSV-IGIV during the past two winter seasons made supplies unreliable . The need for alternative approaches to the prophylaxis of RSV infection in high-risk infants is apparent . <p> A recent study using a RSV intramuscular monoclonal antibody , palivizumab , ( Synagis , MedImmune , Inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevention of RSV infections in high-risk infants . Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the F glycoprotein of RSV -- a surface protein that is highly conserved among RSV isolates.6 Because the monoclonal antibody is not derived from human immune globulin , it is free of potential contamination by infectious agents and can be produced readily in batch lots ; thus , shortages are not anticipated . The recently completed IMpact-RSV clinical trial defines the usefulness of this product for prevention of RSV disease in high-risk infants.7 Palivizumab was approved by the FDA in June 1998 based on the results of this trial . This statement summarizes existing data on palivizumab and provides recommendations concerning its appropriate use in clinical practice . Previous policy from the AAP has described other aspects of RSV disease : epidemiologic characteristics , risk factors for serious illness , laboratory diagnosis , and treatment with ribavirin8 as well as use of RSV-IGIV.1 <h> CLINICAL STUDIES <h> Clinical Efficacy of Palivizumab <p> During the winter of 1996 and 1997 , 1502 infants were enrolled in a multicenter , double-blind , randomized clinical trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . At 30-day intervals , starting at the onset of the RSV season , 5 intramuscular doses ( 15 mg/kg ) of either palivizumab or a placebo were administered . Children eligible for participation in the clinical trial were younger than 2 years with CLD who required continuing medical therapy ( supplemental oxygen , bronchodilator , and diuretic or corticosteroid therapy ) and children 35 weeks of gestation or less who were younger than 6 months at the start of the RSV season . The primary endpoint was efficacy of prophylaxis in reducing the incidence of hospitalization for RSV infections . Secondary endpoints included the total number of hospital days attributable to RSV as well as other respiratory viruses , days of supplemental oxygen therapy , days of altered respiratory illness score ( the respiratory illness score included work of breathing , respiratory rate , retractions , and oxygen requirements greater than 3 days ) , days of intensive care unit ( ICU ) management , days of mechanical ventilation use , and incidence of otitis media . <p> One hundred thirty-nine sites in the United States , Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Placebo and prophylaxis groups were balanced at the beginning of the study for demographics and RSV infection risk factors ( ie , prematurity , neonatal CLD ) . Prophylaxis resulted in a 55% overall reduction in RSV-related hospitalizations ( 11% to 5% in placebo vs palivizumab recipients , respectively , P &lt; .001 ) . Small differences in rates of hospitalizations were noted between placebo and prophylaxis groups in different geographic regions . These rates were 10% prophylaxis compared with 5% placebo for the United States , 15% prophylaxis compared with 9% placebo for Canada , and 10% prophylaxis compared with 4% placebo for the United Kingdom . <p> The number of days of hospitalization for RSV infection per 100 children was decreased from 62 in patients receiving a placebo to 36 in those receiving palivizumab ( P &lt; .001 ) .

Among placebo recipients , 5 children died ( 1% ) compared with 4 children who received palivizumab ( 0.4% ) . Hospital deaths during the study occurred in 2 of the palivizumab recipients , 1 attributed to aspiration and the other to complications of liquid ventilation in a child with RSV pneumonia . <p> Prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections : Indications for the Use of Palivizumab and Update on the Use of RSV-IGIV <p> Adverse events were not significant . Overall , the development of erythema , pain , and induration at the site of intramuscular injection resulted in adverse events in 2% of the placebo recipients and in 3% of infants receiving palivizumab.7 There were no significant differences in adverse event rates or the appearance of antibody to the monoclonal antibody.9 No data are available regarding the potential for adverse events or therapeutic efficacy in a second year of administration . <h> Subgroup Analyses <p> Palivizumab reduced the severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .

Although the overall number of children in the clinical trial allowed for comparisons of smaller groups , these assessments should be considered retrospective and exploratory . <p> Prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections : Indications for the Use of Palivizumab and Update on the Use of RSV-IGIV <p> In a retrospective subgroup analysis , reduction in the rate of RSV-associated hospitalizations from 10% in the placebo group to 1.8% in the palivizumab group was noted for children born between 32 and 35 weeks of gestation who did not have CLD . However , lower rates of hospitalization have been documented for children of similar ages who received no therapy.10 <h> Overall Considerations <p> As noted earlier , palivizumab decreases risk of severe RSV disease , as does RSV-IGIV . No direct studies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palivizumab is not a human blood product and , therefore , is not associated with risks of acquisition of blood-borne pathogens , a potential risk with RSV-IGIV . Because of its ease of administration , palivizumab is favored over RSV-IGIV ( 1 intramuscular injection vs a 4-hour intravenous infusion ) . Furthermore , the availability of palivizumab is not contingent on the blood donor pool . Currently , palivizumab is only available in an intramuscular formulation ; however , an intravenous formulation will likely be available in the near future . The only rationale for such a formulation is to provide the capability of administering this product intravenously if the infant has an intravenous line in place for other reasons . <p> Escape mutants ( ie , resistant viruses ) to palivizumab have not been identified after the administration of this product ; however , the administration of other monoclonal antibodies has been associated with development of such resistant mutants . Surveillance will be required to identify the risk for such events . <p> A critical aspect of RSV prevention in high-risk infants is the education of parents and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of RSV . Preventive measures include eliminating exposure to cigarette smoke and limiting exposure to contagious settings ( eg , child care centers ) . Emphasis on hand-washing in all settings , including the home , especially during periods when contacts of high-risk children have respiratory infections or are at high risk for exposure to respiratory infections from siblings who are in child care or attend school , is also important . <h> Clinical Selection of RSV-IGIV Over Palivizumab <p> Although palivizumab provides effective protection against RSV for eligible infants , and has greater ease of administration and fewer adverse effects than RSV-IGIV , there may be certain considerations that might favor the use of RSV-IGIV . Specifically , in the RSV-IGIV trial , immunoprophylaxis decreased the overall rate of hospitalizations for non-RSV respiratory infections , whereas palivizumab did not . This may be of value in those infants younger than 6 months who are not eligible for influenza vaccination as well as for those infants and children with severe pulmonary disease for whom respiratory infections other than those caused by RSV may be medically important . Similarly , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otitis media , although this latter point alone is unlikely to justify use of RSV-IGIV . Palivizumab has not been tested in the treatment of children with CHD . Neither product is licensed by the FDA for use in children with CHD , and RSV-IGIV should not be administered to children with cyanotic CHD . <h> Administration <p> Palivizumab is administered intramuscularly in a dose of 15 mg/kg once a month during the RSV season . Palivizumab is packaged in 100-mg vials , and opened vials must be used within 6 hours . To minimize wastage , physicians should arrange for administration so that 2 or more eligible patients can receive the vaccine within the 6-hour period after opening a vial . RSV-IGIV is administered intravenously in a dose of 750 mg/kg once a month during the RSV season . <h> Vaccination <p> Palivizumab does not interfere with vaccine administration . Infants and children receiving RSV-IGIV prophylaxis ( 750-mg/kg dose ) immunization with measles -- mumps -- rubella ( MMR ) and varicella vaccines should be deferred for 9 months after the last dose . ( See Table 3.37 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no data on the use of RSV-IGIV and the response to hepatitis B vaccine , but there is no reason to anticipate interference because RSV-IGIV does not contain antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen . RSV-IGIV use should not alter the primary immunization schedule for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids , whole-cell or acellular pertussis , Haemophilus influenzae type b , and poliovirus vaccines ( inactivated poliovirus vaccine IPV or oral poliovirus vaccine OPV ) . The manufacturer of RSV-IGIV has suggested that an additional dose of vaccine might be needed to assure an adequate immune response to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids , whole-cell or acellular pertussis , Haemophilus influenzae type b , and OPV ( refer to the RespiGam package insert ) , but more information is needed before changes in current immunization recommendations can be made . Currently , the available data do not support the need for supplemental doses of routinely administered vaccines . Parenterally administered immunoglobulin preparations have little , if any , effect on the replication of OPV in the intestinal tract . <h> Cost-benefit Analyses <p> Only limited cost-benefit analysis data are available for RSV-IGIV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for palivizumab . Cost-benefit analyses of RSV-IGIV did not demonstrate an overall savings in hospitalization considering the costs of therapy for all at-risk children.12,13 Although results of another study were more favorable , different methods were used.5 <p> Factors other than CLD influence the decision about use of prophylaxis , particularly in children with a gestational age of 32 to 35 weeks , including other underlying conditions that predispose to respiratory complications ( eg , neurologic disease in very low birth weight infants ) , number of young siblings , child care center attendance , exposure to tobacco smoke in the home , anticipated cardiac surgery , and distance to and availability of hospital care for severe respiratory illness . For many infants qualifying for the approved indications , risk of rehospitalization for serious respiratory illness will be low , and the cost and logistical difficulties associated with prophylaxis may outweigh the potential benefits . <h> RECOMMENDATIONS <p> 1 . Palivizumab or RSV-IGIV prophylaxis should be considered for infants and children younger than 2 years of age with CLD who have required medical therapy for their CLD within 6 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most high-risk children because of its ease of administration , safety , and effectiveness . Patients with more severe CLD14 may benefit from prophylaxis for two RSV seasons , especially those who require medical therapy . Decisions regarding individual patients may need additional consultation from neonatologists , intensivists , or pulmonologists . There are limited data on the efficacy of palivizumab during the second year of age ; risk of severe RSV disease exists for children with CLD who require medical therapy . Although those with less severe underlying disease may receive some benefit for the second season , immunoprophylaxis may not be necessary . <p> 2 . Infants born at 32 weeks of gestation or earlier without CLD or who do not meet the criteria in recommendation 1 also may benefit from RSV prophylaxis . In these infants , major risk factors to consider are gestational age and chronologic age at the start of the RSV season . Infants born at 28 weeks of gestation or earlier may benefit from prophylaxis up to 12 months of age . Infants born at 29 to 32 weeks of gestation may benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decisions regarding duration of prophylaxis should be individualized , according to the duration of the RSV season . Practitioners may wish to use RSV rehospitalization data from their own region to assist in the decision-making process . <p> 3 . Given the large number of patients born between 32 to 35 weeks and the cost of the drug , the use of palivizumab in this population should be reserved for those infants with additional risk factors ( see " Cost-benefit Analyses " section ) until more data are available . <p> 4 . Palivizumab and RSV-IGIV are not licensed by the FDA for patients with CHD . Available data indicate that RSV-IGIV is contraindicated in patients with cyanotic CHD.4 However , patients with CLD , who are premature , or both , who meet the criteria in recommendations 1 and 2 and who also have asymptomatic acyanotic CHD ( eg , patent ductus arteriosus or ventricular septal defect ) may benefit from prophylaxis . <p> 5 . Palivizumab or RSV-IGIV prophylaxis has not been evaluated in randomized trials in immunocompromised children . Although specific recommendations for immunocompromised patients can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe combined immunodeficiency or severe acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ) may benefit from prophylaxis . If these infants and children are receiving standard immune globulin intravenous ( IGIV ) monthly , physicians may consider substituting RSV-IGIV during the RSV season . <p> 6 . RSV prophylaxis should be initiated at the onset of the RSV season and terminated at the end of the RSV season . In most areas of the United States , the usual time for the beginning of RSV outbreaks is October to December , and termination is March to May , but regional differences occur.15 The onset of RSV infection occurs earlier in southern states than in northern states.16Practitioners should contact their health departments and/or diagnostic virology laboratories in their geographic areas to determine the optimal time to begin administration . <p> 7 . RSV is known to be transmitted in the hospital setting17 and to cause serious disease in high-risk infants.18 -- 20 In high-risk hospitalized infants , the major means to prevent RSV disease is strict observance of infection control practices , including the use of rapid means to identify and cohort RSV-infected infants.21 If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eg , pediatric intensive care unit ) , primary emphasis should be placed on proper infection control practices .

Tim Walz on Friday urged calm and expressed confidence in the state 's public health system as it seeks to identify others who had been in proximity to the infected patient and may be at risk . All of the patient 's identified contacts will be asked to quarantine themselves for two weeks , and they will be monitored by public health officials for symptoms . <p> " The state of Minnesota has been working around the clock to prepare for this , and I am confident that our Department of Health is up to the challenge , " Walz said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it has been linked to at least 233 illnesses and 14 deaths in the country .

That gives health officials a chance to contain the spread of the virus from this individual . <p> " Are we now suddenly going to go from one to hundreds or thousands ? " Malcolm said .

Contrast that with what happened under the Obama administration , when the employee side of the payroll tax was cut from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent . <p> Larry Kudlow , the director of the National Economic Council , made assurances at a briefing from the Coronavirus Task Force that the Social Security trust fund would be replenished through general revenues . But that would be a lot of backfilling : Garrett Watson of the Tax Foundation estimated a full payroll tax holiday from April through December would cost as much as $975 billion , based on a CBO projection that the payroll tax would raise some $1.3 trillion in 2020 .

Tom Cole ( R-Okla. ) noted , no one should be surprised if Republicans rally around Trump , and it is n't yet clear what the president is willing to give up to get that kind of tax relief . <p> For their part , House Democrats are plowing ahead on their own measure , which could get a vote as soon as this week . And while Democrats have almost universally pooh-poohed a payroll tax cut for this particular situation , House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal ( D-Mass. ) said he would talk with Mnuchin on Wednesday , after the Treasury secretary sat down with Pelosi on Tuesday . <p> TAKE A RIDE ?

But the inclusion of the retail glitch begs a question : Could a new stimulus offer a ride to tax provisions that have so far stalled in Congress ? <p> It 's tough to know how serious discussions are over the retail glitch , though one source said that companies have been invited to discuss the issue with the White House . But there are also reasons to think that a new stimulus might not balloon too much , given the tenor of the discussions so far . <p> POT OF GOLD : Just looking at sales and excise taxes , the eight states where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion in revenue , according to Carl Davis of the liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy . <p> That adds up to an increase of around a third , or nearly a half-billion dollars . Why the big jump ? ITEP says a big part of it was from states like California and Massachusetts , which both started legal recreational sales in 2018 , straightening out some early issues in getting their markets up and running . <p> In all , California now raises about a third of the excise and sales tax revenue raised by recreational cannabis , even as the amount it raises per capita is less than in states like Washington and Colorado . <p> All well and good , but Davis also expressed some concern that revenues could start to decline in the years to come , due to a combination of sales leveling off and marijuana prices dropping . That 's the risk states run , ITEP argues , by largely basing their taxing structure for cannabis on price , instead of benchmarks like weight or amount sold .

Finance Minister Nicolai Wammen said that move would give Danish businesses an extra 125 billion krones in liquidity ( around $19 billion ) . <p> Keeping it in Scandinavia : Norway was facing a potential slowdown just because of coronavirus , and now faces a price drop in its largest export -- crude oil .

Three of the state 's five refineries have already made the switch , with help from a 2017 law that originally offered the sales tax break .

@@31704241 <p> " Fever and cough was observed in almost all COVID-19 patients described in the literature , " Jan Carette , associate professor of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo Alto , explained in an email . " Only very few cases had prominent upper-respiratory tract signs and symptoms ( eg , runny nose or sneezing ) . This means that the virus likely hangs out more in the lower airway rather than the upper airway . " <p> Dr. Maria Raven , chief of emergency medicine at UC San Francisco , explained that an upper-respiratory infection is what 's often referred to as a head cold , and COVID-19 is " what we call lower respiratory , so more from the lung than from the head . " <p> Bruce Aylward , Assistant Director-General with the WHO , echoed this information in an interview with Vox Media , saying many mistakenly think a runny nose is a common symptom . <p> All of that said , Raven added COVID-19 ca n't be diagnosed only by observing symptoms , and anyone who is sick and has any of the potential symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're being very conservative here , because there have been cases that have been missed , " Raven said . " I do n't know if we 're missing the cases because they 're presented with symptoms that are n't obvious . We want to make sure we do n't miss anybody . " <p> The WHO analysis also revealed that most people develop symptoms on average of five to six days after infection , though the range is anywhere from one to 14 days . <p> Coronaviruses are among a group of viruses that cause the common cold , and there are seven known viruses of the type that can infect humans . Four of these ( 229E , HKU1 , OC43 and NL63 ) are seasonal and typically cause mild respiratory infection -- fever , cough , nasal congestion , and headache -- according to Dr. Charles Chiu , a professor of laboratory medicine and infectious disease at UC San Francisco . <p> " The remaining three coronaviruses ( MERS , SARS , COVID-19 ) are the result of recent zoonotic ( animal-to-human ) transmission events and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection can progress to cause severe , life-threatening pneumonia , " Chiu shared in an email . <p> COVID-19 is the most recently discovered coronavirus and was unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan , China in December .

Burlington , N.C.-based LabCorp had reported three negative test results to the Health Department as of Wednesday . <p> The Health Department reported Wednesday morning that it was conducting tests of 14 patients .

@@31709041 <h> Most schools are completely unprepared for coronavirus and virtual learning <p> The threat of COVID-19 , the novel coronavirus , is forcing educators across the country to think about what they 'll do if they have to close their schools for weeks or even months at a time . State and federal agencies have advised schools to create online learning plans to minimize the disruption to student learning . For some schools , that 's a small leap . Their students have internet connections at home , laptops they can work from , teachers who know how to design online lessons and a strong foundation of in-school blended learning experience . <p> But the fact is , these schools are rare . Most schools are completely unprepared -- or , at best , woefully underprepared -- for coronavirus and virtual learning . Unequal internet access is just the tip of the iceberg of a massive equity crisis facing U.S. schools should coronavirus force education online . <p> Unequal internet access is just the tip of the iceberg of a massive equity crisis facing U.S. schools should coronavirus force education online . <p> " People think it 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Beth Holland , digital equity and rural project director at the Consortium for School Networking , an industry association for tech directors across the country . CoSN members have been turning to each other for advice and support about how to approach coronavirus and virtual learning . But Holland is not optimistic . The data just do n't support optimism . <p> According to the latest survey data from the Pew Research Center , 73 percent of adults have broadband internet at home . But the differences based on income are striking . While 92 percent of adults from households earning $75,000 or more per year say they have broadband internet at home , just 56 percent of adults from households earning below $30,000 say the same . About 17 percent of adults access the internet from home through a smartphone only . For the kids in their homes , that means trying to read assignments , write papers , do research and take quizzes with tiny screens and tinier keyboards . <p> Beyond the " boxes and wires " that get kids internet access in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem entirely . <p> As Holland points out , successful remote learning experiences depend on teachers who know how to create and deliver engaging lessons online and students who have the digital literacy skills to access them . If entire K-12 districts move online , what can schools expect of early elementary schoolers ? Not much . Younger children do n't have the independent learning skills , attention spans or social-emotional maturity to succeed in virtual learning environments for very long , let alone the troubleshooting skills they will inevitably need to manage whatever technology they 're using . Many middle and even high schoolers are n't much better equipped . And what 's more , many of those older students may have to help watch their younger siblings during extended school closures , leaving them little time to tackle assignments of their own . <p> A host of organizations have stepped into the fray offering training and advice for teachers contemplating online learning for the first time .

" Some districts have already described their school closure plans as though students will be able to cycle through their regular school schedules from home .

@@31709241 <p> Stan BadzA scenic of the 17th Hole during the Players Championship . ( Photo by Stan Badz/PGA TOUR ) <p> In these uncertain times , just hours after the NBA suspended its season , the NCAA banned fans from March Madness games and other major sporting events cancelled events in response to the coronavirus , the PGA Tour is forging on with its flagship event . ( Players 2020 : Scroll down for the latest updates ) <p> The Players is the tour 's flagship event , and with the organization taking some preemptive measures before the tournament , the PGA Tour felt it was safe to conduct its tournament with fans present , unlike most all NCAA conference basketball tournaments happening Thursday , which will happen without any crowds . The tour is giving fans an option to request a refund instead of attending the event if they chose . Golf , of course , is an outdoor sport and slightly different , but nonetheless it was a surprise to some that the tour is playing today with fans . Here is the statement from the tour : <p> " The PGA Tour is aware of rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Players Championship will continue as scheduled , although we will absolutely continue to review recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control , World Health Organization and local health administrations . This is obviously a very fluid situation that requires constant review , communication and transparency , and we are dedicated to all three aspects . " <p> 6:52 p.m. : Si-Woo Kim closes with a birdie , a nice up and down from the greenside bunker at No. 9 , to get to 7-under , which is two back of the lead of Hideki Matsuyama . This is a strong leaderboard heading into tomorrow , where we do have confirmation that we 'll have tournament play , but no fans , which was announced officially around Noon by PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan . <p> This is uncharted territory , of course , but the PGA Tour is one of the few sports leagues still conducting competition , so in that way , let 's consider ourselves fortunate we have some golf to watch this weekend . It will be a welcome sign with all the craziness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... we 've seen few players over the year birdie all three closing holes . But that 's exactly what he just did to salvage a round that had been disappointing for the majority of it . Rory rolled in a seven-footer to get to even-par on his round . And Brooks Koepka rolls in his birdie to get to 2-under for his round . Jon Rahm finishes at 3-under with a closing par ... all in all , when all three guys were over par at one point , those were huge momentum shifters to end each of their rounds . <p> 6:46 p.m. : Well , we have some positive momentum for the marquee group as they finish their rounds . Rory 's coming off the two birdies in a row and hit a bomb , carrying it 310 yards over the water on 18 . And Brooks Koepka hit a good one , and he 's just stuck it to about six feet for a closing birdie . That 'd get him to 2-under . But more importantly for him , he 's making better swings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's regaining some of that confidence we 've seen from Brooks over the past couple years . <p> 6:38 p.m. : Jim Furyk is making an unnecessary mess of the par-5 16th hole . Jimbo had some positive momentum going at the end of his round , but having layed up in a bad spot in front of the tree , Furyk actually hit the tree with his wedge shot third shot . Ouch . His par putt from the front of the green comes up short , so a bogey will bring him back to 1-under heading to 17 . <p> 6:34 p.m. : Rory McIlroy 's making a little run to end his day after struggling the entirety of Thursday . Rory has birdies at Nos. 16 and 17 to move to 1-over for the round as he heads into 18 . That 'll do him wonders as he tries to position himself for a run to get back in the mix . <p> His playing partners have struggled at times on Thursday but they 've also salvaged the day a bit . Koepka birdied 16 to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Jon Rahm also birdied 16 to get to 3-under as the trio head to the 18th tee . <p> 6:30 p.m. : That 's a sporty par for Si-Woo Kim at the par-4 eighth hole ( his 17th of the day ) . He was faced with a tricky little 40-yard bunker shot , but hit a nice out to about 9 feet and then made the putt -- to stay at 6-under par as he heads to the par-5 ninth hole , his finishing hole . <p> 6:23 p.m. : This is a bit of a wild fact ... these next hour or so will be the last time fans will be watching live golf for the next month or so . <p> 6:15 p.m. : What a debut for THE KIDS . Matthew Wolff stumbled on 18 , but he 's still right in the mix heading into Friday ( -3 ) . And Viktor Hovland and Collin Morikawa are in at 4-under , and to be honest , it should n't be a surprise to anybody that these three played so well on Day 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PGA Tour experience at this point , and they 've all won at this point . It 's exciting to think about what they might do at these big events going through the rest of 2020 , and heck , their whole damn careers . So much fun to watch . <p> 6:07 p.m. : The young guns have made the 18th hole entertaining . Viktor Hovland NEARLY found the water with his drive , but he had just the right amount of carry to cut the corner . Matthew Wolff went wayward off a cart path on the right side , and Collin Morikawa found the pine straw . <p> Wolff had to punch out ; Morikawa 's chop out from the pine straw came up way short , but his third shot is a beauty to about 4 feet . Hovland has a birdie look of about 35 feet for a closing birdie . They 're all at 4-under for the tournament at current . <p> 6:01 p.m. : Si-Woo Kim drops back to 5-under with a bogey at the sixth hole . That 's still the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Si-Woo really has n't done anything all year -- his only made cut since the Mayakoba is a T-37 at the Genesis . But Si-Woo obviously feels comfortable around TPC Sawgrass and shorter Pete Dye courses in general , as he 's also won the Wyndham in the past . <p> Rafa Cabrera Bello joins Si-Woo at 5-under with a birdie at the par-5 second , his 11th hole of the day . They 're both on the same number as Marc Leishman and Patrick Cantlay , four back of the Hideki Matsuyama lead . <p> 5:51 p.m. : The young-gun crew of Collin Morikawa ( -4 ) , Viktor Hovland ( -3 ) and Matthew Wolff ( -3 ) are at 17 , and they all hit great shots . Hovland is the best of the crew , hitting it about hole-high right . He 'll have just outside a tap-in for a birdie . Wolff has about nine feet and Morikawa has 20 feet for his birdie . It 's easy to think about the future of golf and the possibilities of these guys ' careers while watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Players competition . <p> Wolff rolls his eight-footer in for birdie and Hovland taps in , so the entire crew heads to the 18th hole at 4-under in their first time around TPC Sawgrass . It 's an easy game ! <p> Meanwhile , Rory McIlroy doubles No. 15 to move to 3-over . It 's still early , but that 's dangerous territory to make the cut here in his title defense . Couple that his playing competitors -- Rahm at 2-under and Koepka at even , and the group of Hovland , Wolff and Morikawa are 11 shots better than the World Nos. 1 , 2 and 3 . That 's a wild stat ! <p> 5:33 p.m. : Remember when Jim Furyk nearly won this thing last year at age 48 ? Well , now at age 49 ( and turning 50 in two months ) , the veteran has moved to three under with three consecutive birdies to begin the back nine . This guy is going to dominate on the senior tour . <p> 5:28 p.m. : A little life from Rory McIlroy as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That moves him to one over on the day , just one shot back of playing partner Brooks Koepka . Jon Rahm leads what has been a lackluster marquee group thus far at two under . <p> 5:15 p.m. : Let 's take a quick rundown of the leader board . Hideki Matsuyama still leads after that brilliant 63 in the morning , but someone could catch him . Just kidding . No one is going to catch him today . <p> 4:58 p.m. : Matt Kuchar has been enjoying a solid day at two under but just sprayed his approach into short right into the par-3 13th 's bunker . Going to be a. tough up-and-down from there . <p> 4:48 p.m. : Hovland , Morikawa and Wolff are a combined six under in the past two holes , in case you were wondering how they 're doing . On the opposite end , Koepka ca n't get things going , still one over through 10 , while Rory is a two over . <p> 4:40 p.m. : Si Woo Kim makes the turn in four under , tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Peter Malanati . <p> 4:24 p.m. : Hello Hovland ! Viktor drops a 70-foot putt for eagle , erasing a bogey at the 10th and moving him to three under . The Oklahoma State product just won in Puerto Rico two weeks back , would n't a high Players finish be something . <p> 4:10 p.m. : Rory 's chip at the par-5 ninth scoots across the green and into the bunker . From the beach , McIlroy makes a nifty shot , but will have six feet for a. two-over 38 . <p> 4:00 p.m. : The young-gun triumvirate of Hovland , Wolff and Morikawa are hanging tough through their first nine at Sawgrass . Hovland and Morikawa are two under while Wolff is even . <p> 3:45 p.m. : TPC Sawgrass is angry this afternoon , my friends . Matt Jones is the only player making a push ( four under through 11 ) the rest of the field stuck in neutral . <p> 3:25 p.m. : Jon Rahm is keeping steady , even par for his round . Si Woo Kim is also off to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p.m. : A spark for Rory , who trains a 30-footer on the sixth for his first birdie of the day . And after following to two over , Koepka gets one back with a birdie at the sixth as well . <p> 3:15 p.m. : For what it 's worth , the crowds do appear to be thinning on television , at least at the 17th . Part of that could be the coronavirus updates , some of it chalked to Rory and Brooks on the front . <p> 3:03 p.m. : McIlroy converts a shaky six-footer to save par . Not a lot of low rounds at the moment -- Matt Jones is three under through eight -- but Sawgrass is starting to bark back . <p> 2:55 p.m. : Rory McIlroy is off to a slow start , one over through four holes , and though his approach finds the green at the fifth , he 's going to have a long way home for a two-putt par . <p> 2:49 p.m. : Jon Rahm rolls in a birdie at the par-4 fourth hole after hitting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to even par . Brooks Koepka hit an even better approach , and got a bit of a read from Rahm 's putt , but misses his birdie bid . Koepka has looked off early in his round , and he remains at 1-over . That 's the same number as Rory McIlroy . They 're 10 back of Hideki Matsuyama as it stands now . <p> 2:46 p.m. : We 're seeing most of the low rounds thus far coming from the morning wave , but there are some hot starts to players ' rounds in the afternoon wave . The lowest so far is the young stud Viktor Hovland , who won the Puerto Rico Open a few weeks ago . Hovland is 3-under through his first 5 holes . Martin Laird ( through 6 holes ) and Matt Jones ( through 7 holes ) are also on that number . There are a host of players at 2-under from the afternoon wave , but other than that , it 's playing a little more difficult now . <p> 2:29 p.m. : Christiaan Bezuidenhout puts together the second-best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the 18th hole to card a 7-under 65 to open his first Players Championship . The South African has sneakily put together one of the most consistent past couple of months ; winning the Dimension Data Pro-Am on the European Challenge Tour ; and popping at the Arnold Palmer ( finishing T-18 ) and Mexico ( T-29 ) the past couple weeks . The 25-year-old could very well play himself into the Masters with a strong week this week ; as he 's currently 48th in the world , and the top 50 in the world at the end of the month will punch a ticket to Augusta . <p> Harris English is also in the clubhouse with a 7-under 65 to open his Players . In his 21st start at TPC Sawgrass , English has shot in the 60s for just the second time . English has been consistent this season , and he 's backing that up with a great start at the TPC . <p> 2:25 p.m. : Our marquee group is making a mess of things early on on Thursday . Brooks Koepka just missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1-over . And Jon Rahm got in trouble at the par 5 , as a recovery shot for his third at the second hit a tree and came back to him . That also led to a bogey 6 . Rory parred No. 2 , but he 's also 1-over following his bogey at No. 1 . <p> 2:16 p.m. : Harris English ! En fuego ! The former Georgia Bulldog just holed a 35-footer on the par-3 eighth hole to move to 7-under par through 17 holes . That 's tied with Bezuidenhout for the best round on the course , two shy of Hideki Matsuyama 's 9-under 63 . <p> English 's success is further evidence that TPC Sawgrass is such a tough tournament to predict . English had missed the cut here in each of his past six appearances , and boasts only one round in the 60s in 20 rounds at TPC Sawgrass . Yet he 's near the top of the leaderboard here on Thursday . <p> 2:09 p.m. : Christiaan Bezuidenhout with a strong par save at 17 , going from nearly splashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South African keeps that stellar 7-under round going to the difficult home hole . <p> 2:04 p.m. : Rory misses a 7-footer for par to drop a shot on his opening hole ( No. 1 ) to start his title defense at TPC Sawgrass . As you 've probably heard in the run-up to the championship , nobody has ever successfully defended their title at the Players , which is a bit of an oddity . Rory just made that possibility a bit harder with that opener . <p> 2:01 p.m. : Wow ! South African Christiaan Bezuidenhout , with the best round on the course right now , is playing the 17th hole for the first time in competition . And he just had a memorable initiation . <p> His tee shot kept drawing and soared over the green , nearing bouncing into the water . But it ended up on the walkway up to the green . He 'll have an interesting play through the fringe upcoming to maintain this great 7-under round . <p> 1:53 p.m. : The marquee group of the afternoon is officially on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 players teeing off in their first round . They all have missed the fairway , with Rory McIlroy and Brooks Koepka missing the fairway to the left , and Jon Rahm overcutting his tee ball and missing to the right . <p> They know some low scores are possible after Hideki Matsuyama 's 9-under round this morning , which tied the course record at TPC Sawgrass . <p> 1:40 p.m. : Christiaan Bezuidenhout birdies the 14th to move to seven under , a puncher 's chance to tie Matsuyama 's mark . Bezuidenhout has a win and runner-up in his last five starts , and a nice showing at the API last week . <p> 1:32 p.m. : Another name in the mix is Keith Mitchell . Last year 's Honda Classic winner is five under and sticks his approach on the sixth . <p> 1:20 p.m. : Hideki eagles his final hole , the par-5 ninth , to tie the course record with a nine-under 63 . Amazingly , he did it leading the field in strokes gained/putting ( 4.251 ) . <p> 1:11 p.m. : Cam Champ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the final two holes at five under . Champ has struggled since his win in the fall , good to see him right the ship . <p> 1:00 p.m. : Harris English has never made a cut in his Players Championship career . He , of course , is now six under through 11 holes . <p> 12:53 p.m. : Dustin Johnson just misses a birdie at the seventh , but remains two under for the day . DJ has historically struggled at this tournament , so an auspicious start for the former World No. 1 . <p> 12:48 p.m. : Hello Webb Simpson . Using a hot putter ( 1.8 strokes gained thus far on the greens ) Simpson has moved to four under , just two back of the lead . <p> 12:44 p.m. : Hideki adds another birdie the sixth ( his 15th ) , moving to six under . Matsuyama has been in the wilderness for the past year , great to see him back in the mix . <p> 12:41 p.m. : Also on the struggle bus : Rickie Fowler . The former Players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan Spieth . Fowler 's struggled to keep his ball in the fairway thus far . <p> 12:37 p.m. : Phil Mickelson 's poor showing as of late at TPC Sawgrass continues . Mickelson has five bogeys on the day and is near the bottom of the board at three over . <p> 12:26 p.m. : Hideki Matsuyama and Patrick Cantlay are tied at five under , but they are joined by some interesting names at the top of the leader board : Rory Sabbatini , Jim Herman , Christiaan Bezuidenhout , Cam Champ . Currently 12 guys within a shot of the lead . <p> 12:10 p.m. : Francesco Molinari , who was questionable to play after withdrawing from last week 's Arnold Palmer Invitational where he was the defending champ , decided to tee it up . He may be regretting that decision after 10 holes . The 2018 British Open champ with a sneaky-good track record at TPC Sawgrass is now four over . Only two players currently on the course have a worse score . <p> 11:55 a.m. : PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the duration of the tournament . However , after speaking with President Trump and Florida governor Ron DeSantis , the event will go on as scheduled as will future PGA Tour events . At least , for now . However , no fans will be permitted at next week 's Valspar Championship , the WGC-Match Play Championship , and the Valero Texas Open ahead of next month 's Masters . The Corales Puntacana Resort &amp; Club Championship , an opposite-field event the week of the WGC-Match Play , has been postponed . Here is his entire statement : <p> Let me preface my remarks by reinforcing that the health and safety of our players , employees , partners , volunteers , fans and everybody associated with the PGA TOUR is our top priority . <p> I 've spoken to President Trump this morning , and I spoke to Governor Ron DeSantis a few hours ago as well .

Gary Woodland gets to 1-under after a nice up-and-down from the front righthand bunkers ; Sungjae also gets up and down , from the left-hand side , for his birdie , making a putt of about 13 feet . And Bryson had a great look for eagle but just missed , so they 're all at 1-under through their first two holes . <p> 8:46 a.m. : We 're told via our Brian Wacker that there will be an update from the tour before Noon .

Brian Harman , Rory Sabbatini and Sepp Straka were first off No. 1 ; and Russell Henley , J.J. Spaun and Denny McCarthy teed off on the 10th hole at TPC Sawgrass . We were able to see Spaun punching out from a tree to the right of the hole , as well as Henley going wayward to the left off the tee . Henley was able to avoid trouble ; Spaun was not . He was the lone golfer out of the opening six players to bogey his opening hole .

After the government announced it was stopping flights from China , there was talk about adverse diplomatic effects . <p> China is very sensitive to its image in the world , and as a result , Israel made efforts to show that its problem was with the virus , not all of China .

An entire synagogue and Jewish school in New York shut down due to the virus 's spread .

At first , every step toward a blanket quarantine policy was scrutinized as a potential diplomatic crisis -- though , in effect , there was none except a brief hiccup with China . And now , Israel was clearly prescient . <p> All of Italy is in lockdown following its lax policies , and there are predictions that Spain is on the way , as well . The US announced that it is closing its doors to Europeans .

Then came the piano chords , trumpet blasts , violin serenades and even the clanging of pots and pans -- all of it spilling from people 's homes , out of windows and from balconies , and rippling across rooftops . <p> Finally , on Saturday afternoon , a nationwide round of applause broke out for the doctors on the medical front lines fighting the spread of Europe 's worst coronavirus outbreak . <p> " It was from our hearts , to say thanks and show that we can get past this , " said Emma Santachiara , 73 , who came out onto the terrace of her apartment in the Monteverde section of Rome to clap with her granddaughters . <p> Italians remain essentially under house arrest as the nation , the European front in the global fight against the coronavirus , has ordered extraordinary restrictions on their movement to prevent contagions . <p> As of Saturday , the virus had infected more than 21,000 Italians and left more than 1,400 dead , according to national officials -- the worst toll reported anywhere outside of China . Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and restricted movement for anything other than work , health or the procurement of essentials . <p> But the cacophony erupting over the streets , from people stuck in their homes , reflects the spirit , resilience and humor of a nation facing its worst national emergency since the Second World War . <p> And in Italy , the gestures of gratitude and music ring out above the country 's vacated streets , while social media feeds fill with encouraging , sentimental and humorous web videos . <p> On Friday evening , at the exact hour that health officials normally update the daily numbers of the country 's increasing infected and dead , Italians from the southern islands to the Alps sang the national anthem and played instruments . <p> Ms. Santachiara , in Rome , was among them . <p> " It 's not like we 're maestros , " she said , but " it 's a moment of joy in this moment of anxiety .

In another , a teenager spritzed on some perfume for a walk to the kitchen . <p> But while Italians sought to lift the national mood , there was no doubt it was still a heavy one . <p> Images of nurses collapsed from exhaustion or their faces bruised from tightly sealed masks have also spread across the web in recent days . On Saturday , one image circulating widely showed a nurse cradling the Italian peninsula in her arms . <p> Parents posted pictures of unicorns and rainbows drawn by young children with the hashtag " It will all be OK .

The national anthem , usually limited to the start of soccer matches , reverberated off palazzo walls at 6 p.m. on Friday . <p> Like many anthems , it is a martial call to arms and sacrifice , in this case against the Austrian empire , and for unity after being for centuries " downtrodden and derided , Because we are not one people . " <p> " Let us join in cohort , <p> We are ready to die ! <p> We are ready to die ! <p> Italy has called ! " <p> " We 're Italians , and being vocal is part of our culture , " said Giorgio Albertini , 51 , an archaeology professor who clapped from his apartment balcony in the university district of Milan , calling it a way " to feel a community , and to participate of the collective grief .

" <p> A neighbor who had tied an Italian flag to her fifth-floor balcony shouted , " We have the best health care system in the world . " <p> Doctors on the front lines in the besieged region of Lombardy , the core of the outbreak in Italy , heard , and appreciated , the standing ovations . <p> " For us , the support of the people is obviously very important , " said Fabiano Di Marco , head of pulmonology at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo , where he has taken to sleeping in his office . <p> " But even more so , " he added , " is the show of solidarity inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicate themselves to the care of these patients .

" We were a community , not just a bunch of individuals . " <p> Isabella Falautano , a manager in a bank who blasted the national anthem on Friday from a speaker pointed out of the window of her apartment in the Testaccio section of Rome , said , " Even if we ca n't shake hands , even if we 're 20 meters apart , you can still show solidarity .

@@31713841 <h> Covid-19 is now officially a pandemic . Here 's what you need to do about it <p> It is not a time for panic . It is , however , a time to draw up a pandemic preparedness plan . Where to begin ? Siouxsie Wiles to the rescue . <p> The Spinoff 's ongoing expert-led , evidence-based coverage of Covid-19 is funded by Spinoff Members . To support this work , join Spinoff Members here . <p> Now that Covid-19 has officially been declared a pandemic by the WHO , it 's time for us all to make a pandemic preparedness plan . <p> As I explained earlier this week , there are several phases to an epidemic . Here in Aotearoa New Zealand we are one of a dwindling number of countries that is managing to keep the Covid-19 coronavirus out . We could stay like this for the foreseeable future . Or we could find ourselves on the path to an outbreak next week . What that path looks like depends on all of us . <p> I 've said if before and I 'll say it again : we can not afford to panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that 's where a pandemic preparedness plan comes in . The great thing about making a plan now is that you can give it a test drive before you actually need it . That way you 'll find any flaws and be able to fix them . <p> I recommend every household as well as every company , charity , business and other organisation make their own plan . It 'll help us all play our part to #StopTheSpread when Covid-19 arrives for real . <p> Pick a ' pandemic pal ' <p> Get a ' pandemic pal ' , especially if you live by yourself . This will be the person you keep in daily contact with . Make a plan for how you will deliver food and medicines to each other if needed . If either of you gets sick , check in twice a day . Make sure you have back up plans for the care of children , pets , and anyone who may need extra help should you become unwell . <p> Minimise your chances of getting sick <p> Here 's something we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugs , or hongis for the time being . Instead , do an elbow or foot bump . It 'll feel really weird at first . <p> Regularly and thoroughly wash your hands after you 've touched shared surfaces , especially before eating , and avoid touching your face . This coronavirus will likely be able to survive for hours to days as tiny droplets on surfaces , which we may inadvertently touch . Then , when we touch our mouth , nose , or eyes , we can infect ourselves . So , wash hands for 20-30 seconds ( the internet is full of good ideas for songs you can sing to pass the time ) and make sure to dry them thoroughly . <p> If you work in a shared space or you have to hotdesk , consider working from home if you can . If that 's not an option , or you are out in public , strive not to touch things with your fingers . You could try using your knuckles for flicking light switches and pressing lift buttons . Try pushing doors open with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull doors open . <p> If you are an organisation where people hotdesk , spaces should be properly cleaned after each person has finished using the space . Here 's some advice on how to get rid of coronaviruses from surfaces . All businesses should be thinking about the possible ways people could contract Covid-19 at their workplace and what precautions they could put in place when needed . For example , cosmetic company Sephora have announced they wo n't be offering custom makeovers in store . This is because of the potential risk of transferring the virus from person-to-person via their makeup or brushes and sponges . <p> Stay home if you are sick <p> Your plan should have clear instructions for what to do if people have any symptoms , even if they are mild . It 's quite simple really . If anyone experiences any coughing , shortness of breath , fever , tiredness , feeling achy , sore throat , or runny/sniffly nose , they should stay at home . This will help to minimise the spread of Covid-19 . What we want to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work while awaiting the results of his Covid-19 test . It was positive . He works in the hospitality industry . Now authorities are wasting valuable time and resources trying to trace all the people he had close contact with so they can be isolated . <p> If you do have symptoms , and you are worried , call Healthline on 0800 358 5453 . But remember , most people will get over Covid-19 without needing to go to hospital . Do not just rock up at your GP 's surgery or the hospital without calling ahead . We can not afford for healthcare workers to be in isolation because they have been unnecessarily exposed to Covid-19 . <p> Households should be preparing for how they will cope if isolated or ill . Organisations should be planning for how they could continue to function if key people were ill , isolated at home , or if all businesses were instructed to close . <p> Organisations should also be discussing how they can ensure that workers who are ill stay at home . What sick pay do you offer ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the time to treat your staff well . For everyone else , I 'm hoping the government will step in and announce how they will support people . If we ever needed proof that a universal basic income was a good idea and tax cuts a bad idea , I think we 've found it . <p> In summary : make a plan . You do n't even need to start from scratch .

@@31715441 <p> On February 5th , sixteen days after a Seattle resident who had visited relatives in Wuhan , China , was diagnosed as having the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States , the Centers for Disease Control , in Atlanta , began sending diagnostic tests to a network of about a hundred state , city , and county public-health laboratories ? . Up to that point , all testing for COVID-19 in the U.S. had been done at the C.D.C. ; of some five hundred suspected cases ? tested at the Centers , twelve had confirmed positive . The new test kits would allow about fifty thousand patients to be tested , and they would also make testing much faster , as patient specimens would no longer have to be sent to Atlanta to be evaluated . <p> The kits were shipped in small white cardboard boxes . Inside each box were four vials , packed in stiff gray foam ? , which held the necessary materials , known as reagents , to run tests on about three hundred ? people .

But a larger number , about thirty-six of them , received inconclusive ? results from one of the reagents . Another five , including the New York City and New York State labs , had problems with two reagents . On February 8th , several labs reported their problems to the C.D.C. In a briefing a few days later , Nancy Messonnier , the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , said that although " we hoped that everything would go smoothly as we rushed through this , " the verification problems were " part of the normal procedures ? .

Still , the three-week delay caused by the C.D.C. 's failure to get working test kits into the hands of the public-health labs came at a crucial time . In the early stages of an outbreak , contact tracing , isolation , and individual quarantines are regularly deployed to contain the spread of a disease . But these tools are useless if suspected cases of a disease can not be tested . The void created by the C.D.C. 's faulty tests made it impossible for public-health authorities to get an accurate picture of how far and how fast the disease was spreading . In hotspots like Seattle , and probably elsewhere , COVID-19 spread undetected for several weeks , which in turn only multiplied the need for more tests .

" <p> The COVID-19 tests use polymerase chain reaction , or PCR , a technology for whose invention the biochemist Kary Mullis won the Nobel Prize , in 1993 . PCR is highly sensitive to contamination and other faults , which is why the verification step is necessary to insure accurate results . And yet while the reagent problems were , in their way , a fairly ordinary technical hiccup -- Messonnier , at the C.D.C. , was not spinning the situation -- the cascading effects that they 've had on the country 's COVID-19 preparations suggest a much larger problem with the way the United States has structured its pandemic response .

" I 'll be honest . I did n't think that this virus was going to do everything it 's done , " Keith Jerome , the lab 's director , told me . " I did n't think it would be a major health issue for the United States . " Still , he said , " the last thing we wanted to do was to be caught flat-footed . " The U.W. virology lab is subject to strict regulatory oversight , but , thanks to a peculiar feature of U.S. law , it did not initially require any special clearance from the federal government to produce its COVID-19 test . " We started , probably in earnest in mid-January , to prepare what we call a laboratory-developed test , ? " Jerome said . It took a team at the lab , working under the direction of Alex Greninger , about two weeks to develop a working version . But , as soon as Alex Azar , the Secretary of Health and Human Services , declared a public-health emergency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From that point on , any lab that wanted to conduct its own tests for the new coronavirus would first need to secure something called an Emergency Use Authorization from the F.D.A. ( The C.D.C. , which had been working closely with the F.D.A. , received the first E.U.A. for a COVID-19 test on the same day as Azar 's declaration . ) <p> This shift in the regulations sounds perverse , since it restricts the use of new tests at precisely the moment they 're most needed . But Joshua Sharfstein , a former principal deputy commissioner of the F.D.A. , told me that the change is meant to protect the public . " You certainly would n't want to say , ' Any lab can advertise a coronavirus test . ' Because then it 's going to be chaos . There are a lot of people who will sell things that may or may not work . " Sharfstein said that the E.U.A. law was designed to offer the F.D.A. a way to cut through red tape in the case of emergencies . He signed the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the C.D.C. requested approval for diagnostic tests . " I met with the lawyers to explain to me the E.U.A. process , and they basically said , ' It 's whatever we think it is . We can make it up to fit the time . ' If you tell me I 've got twelve hours , I could get some very smart people on the phone to do our best to figure out something that 's going to work . The E.U.A. process is supremely flexible . " <p> Advertisement <p> Yet flexibility was not what Jerome and his lab found when they tried to get an E.U.A. for their COVID-19 test . " From the point of view of the academic labs , we look at it , like , when there 's any run-of-the-mill virus that people are used to , they trust us to make a test , " he said . " But when there 's a big emergency and we feel like we should really do something , it gets hard . It 's a little frustrating . We 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly good at making assays . What we 're not so good at is figuring out all the forms and working with the bureaucracy of the federal government . " Jerome said that Greninger had to call and e-mail the F.D.A. multiple times to figure out what they needed to secure an E.U.A. " At one point , he was very frustrated because he 'd e-mailed them what we were doing so they could review it , " Jerome said . " But legally you also had to mail a physical copy . Here we are in this SARS-CoV-2 crisis , and you have to send them something through the United States Postal Service . It 's just shocking . " ( The F.D.A. has since dropped the requirement to send a CD-ROM or USB drive with a copy of the application . ) Despite these difficulties , Jerome said , the F.D.A. ultimately proved responsive to the lab 's entreaties . " They had good and substantive feedback that made our testing better , and the response time was typically just a couple of days . " <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his colleagues had to decide whether it was worth increasing their testing capacity . " If you start thinking about ramping up volumes , you 're talking about spending real money to do so , " Jerome said . But , though the restrictions that accompanied Azar 's emergency declaration meant that the U.W. virology lab could not conduct clinical tests for COVID-19 , they did not mean that the lab had to stop testing for the new disease entirely . Thanks to another regulatory quirk , the lab was allowed to repurpose specimens it had received for other tests , such as the flu , and test them for SARS-CoV-2 . Jerome said that the lab tested specimens from about three hundred people through the second half of February . " We did n't find anything on those three hundred until , I believe it was , February 29th , " he said . " And then we got a specimen from one of the people who were the two original cases in Washington . " <p> The E.U.A. regulations , however , prohibited the lab from reporting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their patients . To work around the prohibition , Jerome 's lab ? called officials at the state lab and told them , " You 've got to get this patient and test . " ( As it happened , the patient 's specimen was already being studied for COVID-19 . ) In effect , Jerome said , the lab was able to perform at least some surveillance of the outbreak , despite the lack of tests from the C.D.C. " If we 'd been able to test a thousand people or two thousand people , maybe we would have found something sooner , " he told me . " But it does show that it was n't like everyone had it through those last two weeks of February . " <p> Academic labs like Jerome 's were not the only institutions to attempt to fill the void left by the C.D.C. 's faulty tests . Scott Becker is the C.E.O . of the Association of Public Health Laboratories , a nonprofit organization based in Silver Spring , Maryland , that represents and co ? rdinates a hundred and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the public-health labs , Becker told me , tend to be eager for action . " They 're the first ones out of the gate . They know their role . " But Becker 's network was set up to administer diagnostic tests , not produce them . " We figured out surge , we figured out all sorts of other components , but the assumption has always been that there would be a test , " he said . When the problems with its kits were first discovered , the C.D.C. told the labs not to proceed with any tests until new kits could be manufactured , but it refused to say when those would be ready . " You 're just thinking , any day it 's going to show up , " Becker said . " We really felt this enormous pressure to begin testing any way we could . " He corrected himself : " Not only pressure , but responsibility . " <p> The C.D.C. notified the F.D.A. about the reagent problems on February 10th . According to an agency official , the C.D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faulty test kits would soon have a new batch of reagents ready for a suite of enhanced quality-control measures . If the reagents worked , then testing at the public-health labs would be able to begin in a few days . By Friday , February 21st , however , Nancy Messonnier , at the C.D.C. , told reporters that the problems with the test kits were still not resolved . " We are working with the F.D.A. , who have oversight over us , under the E.U.A. , on redoing some of the kits , " she said . " We obviously would not want to use anything but the most perfect possible kits , since we 're making determinations about whether people have COVID-19 or not . " <p> Two days later , Becker called the A.P.H.L. 's director of infectious diseases , Kelly Wroblewski , and told her , " I have a crazy idea . " Becker said that he wanted to ask the F.D.A. to allow his network of public-health laboratories to create their own COVID-19 tests . Wroblewski said that she had been thinking along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " Becker asked Wroblewski . He called the president of his organization to pitch the idea , and then he called the directors of the New York State and New York City labs . " They were , like , ' We could do this . We should go for this , ' " Becker said . " So then I just started calling all my board members , and there was n't a person that said no . " <p> The next morning , Monday , February 24th , Becker and the A.P.H.L. 's president , Grace Kubin , sent a letter to the F.D.A. Citing " the gravity of the current COVID-19 situation across the globe , " they asked the F.D.A. commissioner to allow the A.P.H.L. 's member laboratories to " create and implement a laboratory developed test ( LDT ) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ( COVID-19 ) . " The letter went on : " While we appreciate the many efforts underway at CDC . . . we are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance tests available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratories . " By that night , Becker had still received no acknowledgement to his letter . " I checked in with them to say , ' Did you receive it ? ' And I got an e-mail that said , ' Yes , the commissioner 's office is working up a response . ' I reported that to my staff the next morning . I said , ' O.K. , so that 's the bureaucratic death knell . We tried . We did the best we can . It was a bit of a Hail Mary , but no harm in asking . ' " <p> Becker was certain that was the end of it . But , on Wednesday , February 26th , a half hour before a weekly conference call that the A.P.H.L. used to co ? rdinate its COVID-19 response , which included representatives of the C.D.C. and the F.D.A. , he received an e-mailed letter from the F.D.A. commissioner . " In the context of a public health emergency , " the letter said , " false diagnostic tests can lead to significant adverse health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also serious implications for the analyses of disease progression and for public health decision making . " But then it went on to state that the Emergency Use Authorization law -- the same one that kept the U.W. virology lab from conducting clinical tests -- gave the F.D.A. the ability to authorize " unapproved products . . . including diagnostic tests " if " the known and potential benefits of the product . . . outweigh the known and potential risks of the product . " The F.D.A. was willing to consider an E.U.A. that would cover all of the labs in the A.P.H.L. 's network , and it included a template to " streamline the process to facilitate the protocol that you propose ? . " Becker was stunned at the good news . " We did n't know about the E.U.A. process , " he said . " I did n't really know that we could do such a thing . " <p> Advertisement <p> Becker said that he barely had time to read the letter out loud to his staff before the conference call with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his members , was about to get better . On the call , the representatives from the C.D.C. and F.D.A. announced that one of the reagents -- one of the four vials sent with the original test kits -- should no longer be used ? . Any labs that had been able to verify the results with the other reagents , about forty-five of the original fifty or so , were henceforth allowed to resume testing . By the next day , Becker said , " I felt like the lights were coming on across the country , and we were going to be able to do the job that we were set up to do . " <p> Among the laboratories that were not able to verify the C.D.C. test kits , even after the contaminated reagent was dropped , were New York City 's and New York State 's . This had been a point of frustration especially for Andrew Cuomo , who knew that the Wadsworth Center , the state public-health laboratory , had developed its own working COVID-19 test based on the C.D.C. protocol . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the state filed an E.U.A. application on Friday , February 28th ? . The next day , the F.D.A. approved the test for use by both the city and the state ? . A week and a half later , at the request of New York State , the F.D.A. expanded the E.U.A. to allow the Wadsworth Center to do its own authorizations of laboratories that sought to use its test . <p> On February 29th , the same day that the F.D.A. first approved the New York tests , the agency also issued a new policy guidance that allowed any facility that had been certified to handle so-called high-complexity testing to run its own COVID-19 tests . According to Becker , about five thousand virology labs in the country , including the one at the University of Washington , met the criterion . For the first time since February 4th , Keith Jerome and his colleagues were allowed to conduct clinical COVID-19 tests . " That changed everything , " Jerome said . " We did n't have to wait to get the forms in and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 2nd , the lab at U.W. ran its first clinical tests , on a hundred specimens , but its capacity grew quickly . This past Saturday , it ran more than twenty-three hundred , and Jerome hopes that number will reach three thousand next week . Since the outbreak began , the lab has increased its staff from around fifty to ninety people , and it is now operating seven days a week , twenty-four hours a day . ( He was quick to note that his own heroes are people like Rohit Shankar , a medical scientist who , during the first weekend after the F.D.A. authorization came through , worked till two in the morning , went home and slept three hours , and was back at the lab at seven . ) Just last week , after a forty-minute negotiation , Jerome secured a lease that will allow him to add five thousand square feet to the ten thousand that the lab already has . He has purchased new instruments , too , which , when they arrive , should bring the lab 's capacity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to realize that all my life was preparing for this moment , " Jerome told me . " I think everyone in the group feels that way . " <p> On Friday , during a Rose Garden press conference , President Trump declared a national emergency , and announced that commercial firms were finally ready to start testing for COVID-19 . The night before , Roche , the Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer , had received an E.U.A. to produce COVID-19 for the company 's PCR machines . ( On Friday , Thermo Fisher , an American company , received an E.U.A. as well . ) According to Paul Brown , the head of Roche 's Molecular Solutions division , the company had been working on a test since February 1st . The new tests , he said , which are mostly automated , can make it possible for large testing companies such as Quest and LabCorp to test for COVID-19 ; the highest-capacity tests will run nearly a thousand samples per machine over an eight-hour shift . <p> After his prepared remarks , Trump was asked by a reporter whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's testing capacity . " Yeah , no , I do n't take responsibility at all , " he said . " We were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules , regulations , and specifications from a different time . It was n't meant for this kind of an event with the kind of numbers that we 're talking about . " He was also asked about the dismantling , in 2018 , of a National Security Council directorate dedicated to pandemic and bioterrorism planning . The directorate was established by the Obama Administration after the Ebola epidemic four years earlier , as a means to anticipate and co ? rdinate the government 's response to biological disasters . " I just think it 's a nasty question , " the President replied . " I do n't know anything about it . " <p> The same day he castigated the C.D.C. on Twitter . " For decades the @CDCgov looked at , and studied its testing system , but did nothing about it . It would always be inadequate and slow for a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hoped . President Obama made changes that only complicated things further . " Alberto Gutierrez , the former F.D.A. official , had little patience for Trump 's tweets and comments . " That 's not fair , " he said . " If a general who 's lost a war says , ' I do n't take responsibility because the army that was built for me was an army for a different area ' ? No . It is part of the obligation of the government to figure out what is needed , and what 's changing , and how to change to meet those demands . " ( The C.D.C. did not respond to requests for comment . ) <p> Becker , for his part , insisted that Trump 's repeated assertions , since the epidemic began , that any American who wanted a COVID-19 test would be able to get one represented a fundamental misunderstanding about the role the C.D.C. and the public-health laboratories are expected to play in an epidemic . " That immediately changed the game , " he said . " Instead of handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be in the mass-testing business . The laboratory system in this country is not set up to do that . " <p> As for the delay in scaling up COVID-19 testing capacity during those crucial weeks in February , Jerome told me that the underlying problem had far less to do with the faulty tests produced by the C.D.C. than it did with a system that could not contemplate , let alone manage , the possibility that the C.D.C. might end up producing faulty tests . The F.D.A. 's exclusive authorization to the C.D.C. to conduct COVID-19 tests ended up creating " what you 'd think of as an agriculture monoculture . If something went wrong , it was going to shut everything down , and that 's what happened . " Jerome said that his lab has taken its own steps to mitigate this problem . " We 've built three completely independent testing pathways in our laboratory , so that if there 's a shortage of a reagent or a bit of plastic , we have other ways to do the testing . " <p> Advertisement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to criticize the federal government for not recognizing that its pandemic plans had a single point of failure . The C.D.C. quickly developed a working test , and it was understandable , at some level , that people at the Centers thought that fixing the faulty reagents for the public-health labs would be faster than shifting to an entirely different protocol . Nevertheless , Sharfstein said , " Why are we relying only on the C.D.C. ? What the F.D.A. could have done , and eventually did do , is say , ' You can use other approaches . ' " Even so , he said , " I do n't think it 's quite fair to totally blame the F.D.A. for this . The F.D.A. can design an approach to support the public-health strategy , but someone has to tell F.D.A. the public-health goal . " The delay in clearly establishing those goals , he said , shows why the decision to shut down the N.S.C. directorate was so consequential .

But he 's keenly aware of the immediate impact that the University of Nebraska-Lincoln 's performing arts center had on the city . <p> " I 've had a lot of patrons tell me when the Lied Center opened , it changed Lincoln from a town to a city , " he said .

" <p> Violinist Isaac Stern , who performed at the Lied during its first season , was , in Stephan 's words , " amazed by the acoustics " and , shortly after his concert , called the center 's offices . He wanted to speak with the people who developed the hall to use their acoustic knowledge in the remodeling of New York 's legendary Carnegie Hall . <p> " What a great honor for the Lied Center to be influencing , to this day , what 's happening in one of the most famous concert halls in the world , " Stephan said . <p> More than 3.3 million people have attended the more than 2,300 productions presented at the Lied Center in its 30-year history , fulfilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lincoln . <p> " The vision was pretty bold that Woody Varner put together -- having the greatest artist in the world , in all genres , and having them work with students , " Stephan said .

" <p> Journal Star file photo <p> An aerial shot taken in 1989 of the corner of 12th and Q , where construction of the Lied Center for Performing Arts began to take shape . <p> Performers have included internationally acclaimed classical musicians , such as Stern , Itzhak Perlman and Yo-Yo Ma ; touring Broadway musical companies , including " The Book of Mormon " and " Les Miserables ; " pop and rock artists like Los Lobos and Harry Connick Jr. ; other acclaimed dance companies ; many of the worlds ' top symphony orchestras ; and , in 2018 , the American Ballet Theatre and the St. Louis Symphony . <p> Most performing arts centers are more narrowly focused , bringing in only , say , classical music performances and Broadway shows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has helped to make it one of the top 100 theaters in the world in attendance . <p> That range of styles , genres and performers is perhaps even more important for another reason : It provides a connection with the audience . <p> " One of the things I notice when I 'm at the Lied Center , whatever the performance is , in one way or another , people are elevated on account of the experience , " said Rhonda Seacrest , a 20-year Lied supporter who now heads its advisory board . " It gives us an opportunity to bond together through the performances . <p> " And it is not just people from Lincoln . It does have a statewide component . " <p> That component has a formal aspect -- the Arts Across Nebraska program that takes performers across the state . But , Stephan said , Lied 's statewide impact has also been inspirational , influencing communities -- from Omaha to Holdrege -- to build performing arts centers . <p> Varner 's vision of great artists working with students continues to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marsalis , one of the artists most intertwined with the Lied . He first performed there in 1991 and has returned regularly , including shows in the 20th and this year 's 30th anniversary seasons . <p> Wynton Marsalis has been a mainstay at the Lied , performing there several times . <p> " As a trumpet player , I can only imagine what it would be like to be in a master class , playing with the greatest trumpet player in the world coaching you , " he said . " The students not only get to work with arts , they get to see shows for free or at a very reduced cost . That 's something very few performing arts centers are doing across the country . " <p> In addition to presenting performances , the Lied Center has commissioned and presented new works , including a pair of pieces from the modern composer Philip Glass , performed by pianist Paul Barnes , and a Danny Elfman composition performed by the Berlin Philharmonic Piano Quartet . <p> Those commissions , and all of the Lied 's programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies and individuals . <p> " The Lied Center 's success is the generosity of the people of Nebraska , " Stephan said .

This amounts to an effort to smooth over market disruptions that have made it hard for banks and large investors to sell Treasuries as well as to keep longer-term rates borrowing rates down . The disruptions in the Treasury market sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury rising last week , an unusual move that threatens to swell borrowing costs for mortgages and credit cards . <p> On Sunday evening , U.S. stock futures began falling after the Fed 's announcement .

America 's Abrams-1 , Russia 's T-90As and China 's T-99 battle tanks can not crush the new coronavirus that has already taken the lives of more than 8,000 people and affected more than 200,000 people worldwide , compelling the most developed nations to resort to extreme measures such as lockdowns and stopping flights . <p> We would have saved lives , if the trillions of dollars nations have dumped on weapons had been used in the development of their health sectors , producing more doctors , nurses and health professionals , in building more hospitals , turning their arsenals into warehouses to store medical ventilators to be used in times of health crises such as the one we are now facing . <p> The cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.4 million .

The U.S. still does not have enough testing kits to know the full range of Americans potentially infected by the coronavirus . The pandemic has spread to all 50 states , and the lack of confidence in the administration 's efforts , combined with the shutdown of businesses , schools and restaurants , has triggered steep declines in the stock market -- which Trump has always viewed as a key form of polling for his presidency . <p> The administration 's goal this week includes pushing through Congress another economic stimulus package that is likely to top $1.3 trillion , the centerpiece of which will be checks sent directly to thousands of Americans . <p> In recent days , President Donald Trump has latched onto the idea of the checks as a way to quickly give Americans money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America 's social and business life shuts down as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S. <p> Behind the scenes , the Treasury Department is working on the mechanics of giving Americans direct checks , with the amount depending on one 's income and family size .

The strategy should include identification of key hotspots through the use of Geographical Information System ( GIS ) tools combined with Big Data Analytics . <p> Further , the strategy should include : <p> - Stoppage of all foreign travel to and from the country virtually shutting down the airport and port for passenger travel . <p> - Suspension of all non-essential business other than those engaged in essential services and in the supply of food , medicine , fuel and banking services .

Special attention should also be given to the smooth running of logistics during the period of containment . <p> * Border agencies should provide uninterrupted services albeit with a skeleton staff and maximum precautionary steps taken to ensure their safety . To facilitate this process , customs and border agencies should deploy a less stringent regime with respect to examination checks - for example , reduce referring the cargos to grey line 1 and 2 or red channel and so on . <p> * Priority should be given to the facilitation of local production of essential safety items ( such as masks , gloves , hand sanitiser liquid ) to meet the demand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waives or relaxes the licensing requirements placed on the importation of raw material required to produce such items . <p> * Safety of all employees in essential business services ( such as healthcare , pharmacy and retail ) be mandated via the compulsory adoption of safety measures including the use of masks , gloves , thermometers . <p> * For worst affected industries like Tourism and Construction , the government could consider in consultation with the Banks to look at short term working capital loans to ensure payment of wages etc . The criteria for working capital loans could include demonstration of a certain threshold of orders/business lost due to COVID-19 . The working capital loans should be timebound so as not to have an overall impact on the financial sector and fiscal position of the economy . <p> * For the industries affected the most , the government in collaboration with the EPF and ETF could consider a three-month moratorium on EPF and ETF contributions . <p> * The safety and well-being of the tourists who are presently in the country should be looked at by the relevant tourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the image of the country . <p> Short-term : * Government to outline a policy framework with the stipulation of necessary regulatory approvals so that the private sector healthcare providers would be ready to augment the country 's capacity in terms of testing and treatment , when called upon to do so . <p> * The Government to consider extending the package of concessions given to SMEs ( Debt moratorium , etc ) which lapsed on 29th February for companies with a turnover of less than Rs. 750 million , subject to demonstration of being impacted by COVID-19 . <p> * Activate foreign missions in key markets so that Sri Lankan businesses can seek/access foreign buyers that would be an alternate to imports from countries like China .

The benefit of low oil prices can be translated in to targeted benefits to consumers and targeted activities and sectors .

The activities/program proposed should include low-income earners and own-account workers ( 32% of the employed workforce as at 3Q 2019 ) whose livelihoods are impacted due to the outbreak of COVID-19 . <p> Medium-term <p> * Establish a committee with representatives across all sectors to strategize Sri Lanka 's response to the demand slowdown that is expected to take place in key export markets as a result of COVID19 .

But in addition to the pressing threat the virus poses to human health , these rapid changes have also created an environment in which hackers , scammers , and spammers all thrive . <p> Coronavirus phishing scams started circulating in January , preying on fear and confusion about the virus -- and they 've only proliferated since . Last week , Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic -- a major Covid-19 testing hub -- suffered a ransomware attack that disrupted operations and caused surgery postponements . And even sophisticated nation state hackers have been using pandemic-related traps to spread their malware . The conditions are ripe for cyberattacks of all sorts . <p> More people than ever are working from home , often with fewer security defenses on their home networks than they would have in the office .

" The current situation poses enough challenges . Any additional undesirable events would just make it more difficult . So one worst case consequence of a cyberattack could be slowing down crisis response , for example in the health care sector . " <p> That 's exactly what has played out at Brno University Hospital , where the Czech National Cyber Security Center and Czech law enforcement still have not fully restored digital services . Ransomware attacks on hospitals are common , because scammers hope that the urgent need to function will push administrators to simply pay the ransom . Such attacks always pose a potential threat to the health and safety of patients , but are especially horrific during a pandemic that is straining the world 's health care systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the malware defense firm Emsisoft beganoffering free ransomware response services to health care organizations for the duration of the pandemic , warning that a digital attack on a health care provider during this time would have real-world kinetic consequences . <p> Meanwhile , phishing and scam websites themed around the pandemic are exploding on the web ; some reports estimate thousands of new domains cropping up every day . Crane Hassold , senior director of threat research at the email security firm Agari , says that his team is particularly wary of the threat phishing poses to people working remotely . Home Wi-Fi often does n't have the same defenses -- think firewalls and anomaly detection monitoring -- of corporate environments . And it does n't help that some leading corporate VPNs have major vulnerabilities that companies do n't always take the time to patch . <p> Hassold , formerly a digital behavior analyst for the Federal Bureau of Investigation , also notes that even extra-cautious employees may be more likely to take phishing emails at face value , since it 's not as easy to call across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payroll payment reroute .

Remote connections in particular make it more difficult , if not impossible , for most threat detection tools to differentiate legitimate work from something suspicious . <p> " There 's no question that some intelligence agencies are going to take advantage of this , " says Jake Williams , a former NSA hacker and founder of the security firm Rendition Infosec .

" Whilst there might be a component in here which is truly malicious in the sense of trying to exploit the situation , I think that most of it actually is an effect of people finding that they 've got time on their hands and if those folks are capable hackers they 'll use that time . " <p> While the internet backbone was built with doomsday scenarios in mind , Rendition Infosec 's Williams notes the current global pandemic is far beyond the contingency planning of most organizations . " The only time they would ever even contemplate something like this is a disaster recovery plan for natural disasters or something like the 9/11 attacks . But most people would n't have that and even when they do it 's all about availability and confidentiality , not about threat detection .

Not surprisingly , China 's strategies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termed draconian . <p> Movement in and out of ground zero , Wuhan and 15 other cities in Hubei province , was blocked . Travel by all modes was severely curtailed . People in many Chinese cities were advised to stay home . According to The New York Times , nearly half of the people of the country were confined to their homes . Anthony Fauci , Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States ' National Institutes of Health , noted at that time that China 's extreme approach could work in the given context of rapidly escalating spread of infection . <p> Two months after such extensive lockdowns , some of which are still in place , the daily increase in the number of cases has now drastically reduced . So the question is whether these extraordinary but controversial measures were key to containing the epidemic and what lessons they offer to countries that are still on the upward slope of the epidemic and which of China 's non-pharmaceutical interventions were really instrumental in flattening the curve and taking the country on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would infect two others ( a reproduction number , or R0 , of 2 ) , early models of the disease 's spread that did not take into account such drastic measures estimated that the virus would infect nearly 40 per cent of the country 's population . But , according to Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine , who has been quoted in Nature online , the R0 had an amazing drop to 1.05 between January 16 and 30 , a period that included the first week of lockdowns . <p> On February 28 , the report of a WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 , which comprised 25 national and international experts , made the following observation : " In the face of a previously unknown virus , China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious , agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history . The strategy that underpinned this containment effort was initially a national approach that promoted universal temperature monitoring , masking , and hand washing . However , as the outbreak evolved , and knowledge was gained , a science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containment measures were adjusted to the provincial , county and even community context , the capacity of the setting , and the nature of novel coronavirus transmission there . " <p> It went on to say : " The remarkable speed with which Chinese scientists and public health experts isolated the causative virus , established diagnostic tools , and determined key transmission parameters , such as the route of spread and incubation period , provided the vital evidence base for China 's strategy , gaining invaluable time for the response .... China 's bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic ... China is already ... working to bolster its economy ... even as it works to contain the remaining chains of COVID-19 transmission . " <p> However , questions have been raised in epidemiological circles about the efficacy of such lockdowns in handling the situation when the likely second wave of the epidemic surfaces as restrictions are lifted . It has been argued that such lockdowns prevent large sections of the population from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " within the community . How China phases , both spatially and temporally , the easing of restrictions in the weeks to come will be critical . <p> In this context , however , the report reassuringly said : " Appropriately , a science-based , risk-informed and phased approach is being taken , with a clear recognition and readiness of the need to immediately react to any new COVID-19 cases or clusters as key elements of the containment strategy are lifted emphasis added . " The mission endorsed the belief of the Chinese authorities that it should soon be possible for the country to manage a resurgence in COVID-19 cases if that should occur once the restrictions are lifted " using even more tailored and sustainable approaches that are anchored in very rapid case detection , instant activation of key containment activities , direct oversight by top leadership and broad community engagement " . <p> In an interview to The New York Times , Bruce Aylward of the WHO , who led this mission , said : " ... hundreds of thousands of people in China did not get COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , China 's counter-attack can be replicated , " but it will require money , imagination and political courage " . Added to this was nationwide people 's commitment . " There was tremendous sense of ' We 've got to help Wuhan ' , and not ' Wuhan got us into this ' . Other provinces sent 40,000 medical workers , many of whom volunteered , " Aylward said . <p> But there is criticism that China 's slew of measures came only after an initial phase of opaqueness about the epidemic and authoritarian dealing with any attempt by individuals trying to speak out about cases of a mysterious infection and the real ground situation , which perhaps led to a delay of two to three weeks in taking steps to contain the growing epidemic . " The delay of China to act is probably responsible for this world event , " Nature.com quoted Howard Markel , a public health specialist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . <h> Asymptomatic cases drove rapid spread <p> A study published in Science on March 16 suggests that undocumented mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the epidemic in China before travel restrictions and other isolation measures were put in place drove its rapid spread across the country . The study used data on people 's movement between 375 Chinese cities between January 10 and 23 , focussing particularly on the time leading up to the Chinese lunar new year , to simulate how SARS-CoV-2 spread across China and has estimated that these account for 86 per cent of all infections . <p> According to the study , while these undetected cases were only half as infectious as the known cases , the large number of such cases out there became the source for over 80 per cent of the diagnosed infections across the country . It is thus the undocumented cases that drove the spread and growth of the outbreak , at least in the initial phase , as per the study . The researchers also found that the tide turned following the travel curbs , self-quarantine and physical distancing advisories and widespread testing implemented on January 23 and thereafter , and documented cases accounted for 65 per cent of all infections . <p> Clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably occurring in other parts of the world as well . " Depending on their contagiousness and numbers , undetected cases can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur , " said Jeffrey Shaman , one of the authors of the study . " These stealth transmissions will continue to present a major challenge to the containment of the outbreak going forward , " he added , an observation that should hold good for other affected countries as well . <p> According to a model simulation carried out by scientists at the University of Southampton , which Nature.com reported , if China had implemented its control measures three weeks earlier than January 23 , it could have prevented 67 per cent of all cases there and would have cut the global number of cases to 5 per cent of the total . A study on the containment measures used in 296 Chinese cities says that cities that suspended public transport and banned public gatherings and events before their first cases showed up had 37 per cent fewer cases than cities that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the travel bans suggest that these did slow down the disease spread initially but not for long . According to a study published in Science in early March , banning travel in and out of Wuhan on January 23 delayed its spread to the rest of China only by three to five days . But it had a larger immediate impact on the international spread of the virus ; there were 77 per cent fewer cases imported from mainland China than would have been expected otherwise . However , this only delayed the international spread by a few weeks because by mid February importation from other places in China , like Shanghai and Beijing , where the virus had got established , resulted in a rise in the global spread . <p> According to the study , even blocking 90 per cent of travel slows down the spread only by a matter of weeks on its own unless other measures are implemented . Of course , many countries across the world , including India , have now imposed severe travel restrictions . Their success in containing the spread will depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing , detection and isolation of confirmed cases , effective advisories for self-quarantine in suspected cases , physical distancing among the asymptomatic and avoidance of gathering of people . <p> So , does China 's aggressive approach , and its apparent success at stemming the spread of COVID-19 , provide any lessons for other countries ? Are lockdowns and travel bans the answer ? Even as Italy and Spain , confronted with massive surges in the number of cases and deaths -- Italy , with over 4,000 deaths , has overtaken China 's death toll of 3,242 -- imposed partial or total lockdowns in their different regions , it would be difficult to implement China-like measures given the latter 's political system . Elsewhere , adherence to such measures can only be voluntary . The high fatality rate in Italy ( 8.3 per cent compared with China 's current average of 4 per cent ) is perhaps attributable to the high fraction of people above 65 years of age , who , as has become clear , are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than younger age groups . According to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , where the very young , who can be asymptomatic carriers of the virus and can unwittingly transmit the infection , mingle and interact with the aged could be another contributing factor to the high mortality rate in Italy . <p> " Much of the global community , " noted the WHO-China Joint Mission report , " is not yet ready , in mindset and materially , to implement the measures that have been employed to contain COVID-19 in China . These are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimise transmission chains in humans.Fundamental to these measures is extremely proactive surveillance to immediately detect cases , very rapid diagnosis and immediate case isolation , rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts , and an exceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance of these measures emphasis added . " <p> Actually , the observation made by the report ( in bold above ) is somewhat off the mark . The successes in South Korea and Singapore , the sizes of these countries notwithstanding , offer excellent examples of how measures ( in italics above ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other settings . From the peak of 909 cases on February 29 , South Korea , a country of 50 million people ( very small compared with China or India ) , has brought the number of daily cases down to about a tenth , and it has done so without taking any authoritarian measures or locking down towns and cities . <p> The reason for the Korean success has been the world 's most expansive and meticulously planned and organised testing programme , followed by effective isolation of confirmed cases and tracing and quarantining their contacts . According to www.ourworldindata.org , which compiles data from official and other published sources , South Korea has tested more than 2,80,000 people , that is , nearly 5,700 tests per million population , which is more than any other country . In comparison , India ( as of March 19 ) has carried out tests on 14,175 samples ( from 13,285 individuals ) , which works out to a meagre 11.7 tests per million people . This is far fewer than what many other neighbouring countries , such as Thailand ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to achieve . <p> This suggests that the number of confirmed cases in South Korea is closer to the total number of cases than in other countries , notes the website . South Korea 's experience shows that diagnostic capacity at scale , case isolation and contact tracing are key to epidemic control . After SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China , South Korea ramped up its manufacturing capacity quickly in collaboration with manufacturers after the first kit was approved on February 7 . A similar strategy has been adopted by Singapore too , which has been in a state of advanced readiness , including availability of hospitals , beds and adequate intensive care and quarantine facilities , so that the situation does not become unmanageable at any point of time . <h> The Indian situation <p> The Indian situation , with just 256 cases ( and four deaths ) as per the Union Health Ministry data of March 21 , might seem comforting , but as epidemiologists and health experts have pointed out , this could be a big illusion arising out of the abysmally low level of diagnostic testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals only if they develop COVID-19 's classic symptoms even if they have been identified by contact tracing or had a history of travel to countries with the epidemic and are , therefore , potential carriers of the virus even though currently asymptomatic . Increasingly , studies and modelling efforts by scientists point to a much greater role played by asymptomatic carriers of the virus in the spread of the epidemic around the world . <p> Ramanan Laxminarayan of the U.S.-based Centre for Disease Dynamics , Economics &amp; Policy said in a piece he wrote for The Hindu : " Testing is the most important thing we could be doing right now .... We need to identify coronavirus-infected patients in a timely manner in order to increase our chance of preventing secondary infections . There is no shame in admitting that we have far more cases than what we have detected so far .... If widespread testing were to commence in India , the number of confirmed cases would likely climb to the thousands very quickly . " <p> " If the projections from Europe , " he wrote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be upwards of 20 per cent . " This amounts " to about 200-300 million cases of COVID-19 infections and about four and eight million severe cases of the kind that are flooding hospitals in Italy and Spain at the moment " . He also warned that the infrastructure of the country 's health care system , such as the number of intensive care unit beds and ventilators , was inadequate . <p> T. Sundararaman , former Director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre , New Delhi , made similar observations in an interview to HuffPost India recently . The narrow criteria for testing make it more or less mandatory to test only those who walk in feeling unwell or feverish . " It is a self-fulfilling prophecy . You are actually not being able to detect whether community spread is happening or not . There is no reason why India will not have community spread . " According to him , instead of the current 61 testing centres , there should at least be 10 times that number ; there should be at least one testing centre for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not test every fever . But any fever with respiratory symptoms suggestive of early pneumonia , shortness of breath , should be tested . You should not wait for a contact relationship . You should be offering the test much more widely now , " he said . <p> So , the illusory small number of COVID-19 cases ( and deaths ) in India , and the comforting statistic that there were a lower number of cases and deaths in the country in the SARS-CoV-1 and H1N1 epidemics compared with other parts of the world , should not drive the nation into complacency . Historical comparisons are good when the arguments are compelling . In the present case , they are not . SARS-CoV-2 , with its much higher contagiousness and infectivity even from asymptomatic carriers , seems to be a different beast compared with other coronaviruses . Moreover , scientists are yet to fully unravel the science of the virus and the disease . <p> The country , therefore , needs to be prepared for a rapidly mounting number of cases to the tens of thousands and more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence . As Laxminarayan wrote : " This is how epidemics move and the real numbers should spur us into positive action . " The prognosis for India by these experts holds an important message for the health authorities . One hopes that someone is listening , and it is high time that health measures besides shutdowns and travel restrictions are put in place . <p> Comments that are abusive , personal , incendiary or irrelevant can not be published . <p> Please write complete sentences .

He and his colleagues keep in touch on Zoom . <p> Recently people have also tuned in to weddings , bar mitzvahs and meditation sessions on Zoom .

People have also flocked to Webex in record numbers in the past few weeks . But Zoom is getting all the buzz , even against large competitors like GoToMeeting and Skype as well as Google Hangouts and Microsoft Teams . <p> One advantage to Zoom is that it only makes video-calling products , and has focused on making sure people like them . <p> " People love the experience more and recommend it to others , " said Christoph Janz , co-founder and managing partner at Point Nine Capital . <p> The Berlin-based venture firm previously used Skype for meetings , but for the past few years has counted on Zoom , Janz said . Zoom offers higher video quality and fewer interruptions and a better overall experience , he said , adding that he spends five hours per day or more on Zoom . <p> " It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think there is still huge room to grow in the broader economy , " Janz said . <p> One of the firm 's portfolio companies , Oslo-based Confrere , makes video calling software that Norwegian doctors have been using to meet virtually with patients .

She 's critical of the user interface and is n't a fan of all the buttons , colors and advanced settings . <p> " But when I 'm in the call , it 's going to work , " she said .

As a result , estimates regarding both the length and magnitude of economic impact vary greatly . <p> Heightened fear and uncertainty can lead to illogical share price movements , which creates the opportunity to reposition portfolios to capitalize on the mispricing . An example of this mispricing is the increasingly massive discount that has become available in a litany of micro-cap and small-cap REITs . After February 's market selloff , the average micro-cap REIT now trades at only approximately 2/3 of NAV , whereas the average large-cap REIT still trades at a premium . This suggests that many micro-cap and small-cap REITs have become more attractively priced relative to large-cap REITs .

Missing Syndergaard this year , of all years , has the potential to be particularly painful for two reasons : their minimal rotation depth and the unusual schedule we might see once baseball resumes . <p> To address the depth first : The Mets ' hypothetical contention this year is built largely on their excellence during the second half of last season ( 46-26 ) . But now they are looking at substituting Rick Porcello and Michael Wacha in the current rotation for Syndergaard and Zack Wheeler from that rotation . That is a potential ace No. 2 starter and a guy who had a 2.83 ERA after the All-Star break last year replaced by a pair of veterans who have been injured or ineffective or both in recent seasons . <p> Beyond the top five , you have the likes of Walker Lockett , Corey Oswalt , David Peterson and Erasmo Ramirez ( a non-roster invitee with 92 major-league starts of experience who impressed manager Luis Rojas in his audition for a long-reliever/swingman role before spring training was halted ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Series , they benefited from strong debut seasons from Syndergaard and Steven Matz .

( Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press via AP ) Photo Gallery <p> PHILADELPHIA -- Newscasts bring word of " hot zones " and " lockdowns .

I would draw a comparison to increasing the minimum wage rather than pensions . <p> We already have rental increases happening annually and it is not crazy to assume that a minor adjustment to those increases alone , along with gradual and imperceptible increases in the cost of goods , entertainment , holidays and education etc. to effectively render it obsolete in the same way that increasing the minimum wage does . <p> Whilst I agree the universal basic income can help . But it will be equally meaningless for the rich self employed as well as not enough to compensate a self employed plumber who has ? 800 per month cost for a van lease , and other commitments . <p> It would mean a hairdresser working to supplement the other householders income getting money that over pays against their previous income . <p> Whilst I certainly agree , post COVID 19 it should be looked at , it ca n't be an instant add water policy on the hoof now .

And I know to advocate " we can do nothing " is defeatist and wrong . <p> Yes , in the best of times , UBI would build a financial floor through which no citizen could fall below , and cement a decent standard of living in good times or bad for the precarious and self-employed . <p> There are good things about UBI , such as the restoration of a differential between those who strive for self improvement through work and upskilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UBI is that it appears likely if the " financial floor " is too generous then the incentive to self improvement for many will tend to disappear . That 's why I suggest that in normal times , I.e. , without the wholesale economic disruption due to coronavirus , UBI should be renamed UBS , meaning universal benefit supplement , indicating that citizens who are not disabled are expected to seek income through work . <p> Owen and those on the left , mainly , repeatedly return to the concept of a Universal Basic Income as though it is a new idea , the latest thinking on the topic , that is is very much " of today " and a current idea whose time has come . <p> None of this is true , countries have paid communities a basic universal income for more than a 100 years in some cases .

It traps those who do n't share those attributes in a spiral of helpless , soul destroying dependence . <p> In addition to the real life examples I describe , most recent trials - and there have been a good number - have concluded that it does n't benefit those it is most intended to help . We should be very , very careful about introducing it . <p> I am actually incredibly impressed with how Johnson and his Government have dealt with this crisis so far . <p> Unbelievable that you think this - is it ignorance or stupidity or are you playing politics ? - and that so many people have upvoted it .

Get back to you in 5-10 years . <p> Yeah but how would UBI really work in an open economy . What are the serious fundamentals that would need to change to make it managable .

It 's cheaper to administer , we 'd all be in the same boat , and people who want to and can earn more should be encouraged to do so . <p> ? 1000 a month for 25,000,000 workers equals ? 300b a year . That 's almost 3x what we spend on the health service ... an awful lot of tax to recover from the wealthy , Owen . <p> The problem here is n't Owen but your wilful ignorance . <p> By which I mean given UBI is not a new idea the costings of it have been debated and written about long before Owen Jones mentioned it in an article in the Guardian . <p> So given the resource that is the Internet and why do n't you try and answer your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way also includes understand the effects of them such as how they stimulate the economy ( which increases tax revenues ) ? <p> The preliminary results of the one in Finland are very modest for starters .

Time will tell , but as of now it 's pie in the sky . <p> Meanwhile in the UK , you have an out of control ZHC regime , poor pay and low productivity - these are direct and tangible issues that can be addressed directly to vastly improve people 's lives right now , 100% guaranteed . Your country Sweden and my Denmark and a number of other European states provide the empirical basis for a blueprint for a much better organised labour market that can be implemented in the UK instantly .

Officials will now turn away most migrants entering the country from the U.S.-Mexico border -- including people coming legally and fleeing violence . Jean Guerrero of KPBS spoke to families stuck in limbo at the country 's busiest land border crossing , just south of San Diego in Tijuana . <h> Read the Full Transcript <p> Judy Woodruff : <p> Now for a look outside the U.S. <p> Last week , President Trump announced strict new border controls , citing concerns over the coronavirus . Officials will now turn away most migrants entering the country from the southern border . <p> That includes people fleeing violence , even if they come legally and show no signs of being sick . <p> Jean Guerrero of member station KPBS spoke to families stuck in limbo at the country 's busiest land border crossing just south of San Diego in Tijuana . <p> Jean Guerrero : <p> This family from Michoacan , Mexico wants to ask for asylum in the U.S. <p> Last week , after seven months on an asylum wait list , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . But when they came to the port of entry , they learned the border had been shut down because of the coronavirus . They asked us to hide their identities for safety reasons . <p> Woman ( through translator ) : <p> We 're fleeing a place where you ca n't really live . They extort you , and if you do n't pay , they kill you . <p> Jean Guerrero : <p> Ana has pictures of her house from when she says it was riddled with bullets and marks on her body from when she was beaten by the local gang . <p> Ana ( through translator ) : <p> The virus worries me because of my health . But what worries me much more is what I have experienced . We are truly in danger in Mexico . <p> Jean Guerrero : <p> She has audio of when she says the gang broke into her house and threatened her . <p> The family and tens of thousands want refuge , but they 're stuck in Mexico . It 's unclear when the port will reopen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. banned nonessential travel at the border last week , in addition to the ban on everyone without U.S. documents . <p> Tens of thousands of people normally cross daily to work and shop . <p> Paola Avila of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce says the impact on workers will be severe , but that the halted traffic is necessary . <p> Paola Avila : <p> People are going to lose jobs . Our businesses are going to suffer from that , from that halt , but it 's something that we have to contribute . <p> Jean Guerrero : <p> Vulnerable families fleeing death threats could be the most affected . Some jump the border wall out of desperation . President Trump says new restrictions are meant to prevent an outbreak in border stations and beyond . <p> President Donald Trump : <p> Our nation 's top health care officials are extremely concerned about the great public health consequences of mass uncontrolled cross-border movement . <p> Jean Guerrero : <p> Tijuana migrant shelters are scrambling to keep up with the need for beds . <p> So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in each room . Instead of 10 , there are five , so they can be a little separated . <p> Jean Guerrero : <p> Migrants ' hands are sanitized each time they enter , and a doctor will soon be checking temperatures every day . The shelter is reducing intake to 80 people , half its usual capacity , to keep people spread out . <p> Murphy is worried he and others could get the virus . <p> Father Pat Murphy : <p> I 'm 68 . And I should n't even be down here . I should be up in my room the next two months . But my heart does n't let me do that . <p> Jean Guerrero : <p> Here , asylum seekers have a place to eat and feel safe until it 's their turn to enter the U.S. <p> But the shelter does n't have room for everyone . Many sleep on the street , where they 're exposed to cartel violence . Others stay in cramped tents , where it 's hard to protect themselves from getting sick . Murphy says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political agenda and hurt some of the world 's most vulnerable people . <p> Father Pat Murphy : <p> He 's taking advantage of this situation to take away the few rights that people have left to ask for political asylum . He has no idea the suffering . <p> Jean Guerrero : <p> But the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , Chad Wolf , says the decision to turn these people away is based on input from the nation 's top health leaders at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention . <p> Chad Wolf : <p> The CDC director has determined that the introduction and spread of the coronavirus in the department 's Border Patrol stations and detention facilities presents a serious danger to migrants , our front-line agents and officers and the American people . <p> Jean Guerrero : <p> But while the U.S. has more than 75,000 confirmed coronavirus cases , Mexico has about 500 . <p> This private cross-border health care provider helped set up checkpoints in Tijuana a short walk from the U.S. to give free coronavirus symptom screenings . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says they want to prevent the spread in Mexico , including among migrants , where the risk is particularly high due to unsanitary , crowded conditions . <p> Ricardo Vega : <p> They are confined in places we know they do n't have enough toilets or enough flushing water or separate spaces . <p> Jean Guerrero : <p> At one shelter , a Guatemalan asylum seeker with three children faced an uncertain future . <p> Woman ( through translator ) : <p> I never wanted to leave my country . I never wanted to expose my kids to so much danger . <p> Jean Guerrero : <p> But she says she had no choice ; the people threatening to kill her family in Guatemala were scarier than the coronavirus.

Particularly on a relatively balmy spring day . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That was before the coronavirus . When there were oodles of tourists and Montrealers shopping and/or working in the area . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While the Schwartz&amp;rsquo ; s restaurant is closed , the takeout counter next door is open for an old-fashioned , medium-fat smoked-meat sandwich , fries , pickles and slaw . And while customers can pick up or get their grub delivered , only a handful dropped by and less than a dozen orders were sent out on the Foodora service during Tuesday&amp;rsquo ; s lunch period . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; With the news that all restaurants had to shut down , those offering takeout and delivery were tossed a bone by the province , qualifying as providing essential services . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But it remains to be seen if this will be a panacea . Some restaurateurs are taking a shot at takeout and praying for the best ; others are taking a pass . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A somewhat disconsolate Frank Silva , the longtime Schwartz&amp;rsquo ; s general manager , has never seen St-Laurent Blvd. this deserted . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s an absolute ghost town in what was one of the busiest streets in town , &amp;rdquo ; Silva said . &amp;ldquo ; But we will be the last one standing . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Business hasn&amp;rsquo ; t been crazy , but thank God for the takeout counter because we are still able to serve some of our regulars . We&amp;rsquo ; re still moving with a skeleton staff who volunteered to work . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Silva had already shut the restaurant before the provincial edict came down . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The restaurant is too small and I didn&amp;rsquo ; t think it was an ideal situation that people shared tables with strangers , even though we had closed every second table , &amp;rdquo ; he said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;146038;TOOLONG ... title= " Schwartz 's general manager Frank Silva cuts up smoked meat for sandwiches at Montreal restaurant on March 24 , 2020.

The others have been temporarily laid off . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After closing its dining room , Mamma Mia Pizzeria in N.D.G. also decided to keep its takeout and delivery operation going . The resto has its own delivery drivers . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s a little slow now , which is normal , &amp;rdquo ; said manager Sam ( who didn&amp;rsquo ; t want to disclose his surname ) . &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re taking all necessary health precautions . But even at a reduced pace , we&amp;rsquo ; re still able to operate , and for that our customers seem most appreciative . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I&amp;rsquo ; ve never seen anything like this in my lifetime . But we&amp;rsquo ; ll continue until we get out of this &amp;mdash ; which will hopefully be sooner than later . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Chinatown&amp;rsquo ; s Beijing restaurant is anticipating starting a takeout and delivery operation next week . One of the most popular Chinese eateries in the city , Beijing could use a break . Ever since word of the coronavirus in Wuhan emerged locally , business there as well as at many other Chinese restaurants suffered , mostly due to hurtful stereotypes wrongly linking them to the virus . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Manager Jun Yu noted that Beijing was in the midst of finalizing a deal with a delivery service . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Hopefully , takeout business will help keep us going , &amp;rdquo ; Wu said . &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s not just this month that business has been suffering . We&amp;rsquo ; ve been having a tough time since January , even though people had no reason to be scared . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The legendary &lt;a href= " https : **33;146103;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Chalet Bar-B-Q in N.D.G. , which just marked its 76th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; , has taken the opposite approach . It will opt out of takeout and delivery service for a spell as of Wednesday night . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; With the dining room closed , we decided we would also close takeout for two to three weeks , &amp;rdquo ; manager David Theivan said . &amp;ldquo ; We decided this would be best for our customers and employees . The takeout business had been quite good , but we just don&amp;rsquo ; t want to take any chances these days . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Among the first high-end group of restaurants in the city to announce it was shutting down its dining rooms after March 14 was the David McMillan/Fred Morin collective behind Joe Beef , Liverpool House , Vin Papillon and McKiernan Luncheonette . But the initial plan was to do takeout and delivery out of McKiernan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;146138;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;146180;TOOLONG ... out ?

Theories abounded as quickly as supplies depleted . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to some &amp;mdash ; not necessarily experts &amp;mdash ; &amp;nbsp ; one theory was linked to the virus somehow being transmitted through shared bidet usage in Japan and Europe . Then again , some U.S. retailers have reported that bidet sales have also been booming lately &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So just how did toilet paper become the poster child of the coronavirus crisis ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Dino Bianco has a more credible theory . Toilet paper invariably comes in bulk , packages containing up to 12 or more rolls . Supermarkets and drug stores have a finite amount of space . It doesn&amp;rsquo ; t take much to empty those shelves , especially after consumers first became aware of the coronavirus and started stocking up . It&amp;rsquo ; s a perception/reality conundrum. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But the bottom line is that we shouldn&amp;rsquo ; t be getting too bummed out . According to Bianco , Canada will not be running out of toilet paper any time soon . It&amp;rsquo ; s been a case of stores not being able to re-stock quickly and suppliers not being able to meet the spike in demand fast enough . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Bianco knows this world well . He is chief executive officer of &lt;a href= " https : //www.krugerproducts.ca/ " &gt;Krug ... Products&lt;/a&gt; , which produces a third of all tissue products sold in Canada . Its brands of toilet paper , facial tissues and paper towels include Cashmere , Purex , &amp;nbsp ; Scotties , White Swan and SpongeTowels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Though now based in Mississauga , Kruger Products was founded in Montreal in 1904 by Joseph Kruger and has four of its eight plants in Quebec , with another state-of-the-art facility slated for &lt;a href= " https : **33;146931;TOOLONG ... next year . All these plants are now going 24/7 to meet demand . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; People were told they should prepare for self-quarantine and they should have supplies in hand , &amp;rdquo ; Bianco said . &amp;ldquo ; So they went out and bought essentials like tuna and beans and toilet paper . But grocery stores don&amp;rsquo ; t carry that much toilet paper in its designated sections , because it takes up lots of space . So the shelves fast emptied . And as soon as you soon see an empty shelf , your mind says supplies are running out and you&amp;rsquo ; d better buy more . Then pictures start going around the internet and panic sets in that there&amp;rsquo ; s a shortage . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Toilet paper is a very emotive item . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So Bianco has been spending much of his days trying to calm people down . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; There was a lot of misinformation out there , about toilet paper coming from overseas and supplies running out , &amp;rdquo ; reasoned Bianco , who also reports large increases in facial tissue and paper towel sales at stores and pharmacies. &amp;ldquo ; But the reality is our supply chain is strong . It&amp;rsquo ; s just a question of trying to catch up with this crazy demand . It&amp;rsquo ; s just unfortunate that at this stage that we are still seeing some empty shelves . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Slowly but surely , though , it&amp;rsquo ; s starting to work its way through . We have a stable and contained supply chain . We have the raw materials in place , our workers are going full out and we have trucks delivering . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Regardless , there are still many freaking out . There is all manner of wild speculation on the internet . There are all sorts of chats and tweets , from the sobering to the surreal to the silly . One popular video has a customer paying off his java bill at a caf&amp;eacute ; in sheets of toilet paper and adding a few more for a tip to the grateful barista. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;146966;TOOLONG ... title= " Empty toilet paper shelves as seen at the Maxi store in Dorval on March 13 , 2020.

Especially now that people are at home more . But the irony is that the coronavirus doesn&amp;rsquo ; t cause people to use more toilet paper . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Well , then again &amp;mdash ; to politely put it &amp;mdash ; &amp;nbsp ; the anxiety the virus induces can lead to irregularities requiring increased usage . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The reality is that it will eventually reach a point where shelves are full and people&amp;rsquo ; s closets are full . Then we&amp;rsquo ; re going to get the yin and the yang of this phenomenon . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Which is to say that while the company&amp;rsquo ; s store sales are exploding , the other end of the coin is that volume at empty hotels and restaurants will be seeing a sharp reduction . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We will be taking a hit on that side of the business . But we do supply health care , which will , unfortunately , use more . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This increased attention to tissues has had a personal side effect for Bianco. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I&amp;rsquo ; m getting calls from people I haven&amp;rsquo ; t heard from in 20 years . Now they want to be my friend again , &amp;rdquo ; he mused . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Toilet paper can do that to a relationship these days . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **32;147031;TOOLONG " **39;147065;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; **26;147106;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;147134;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;147176;TOOLONG ... has us all wound up .

If one person in your laundry facility is contaminated , your laundry facility is shut down , &amp;rdquo ; he said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Boucherville-based JAMP Pharma is also doing its part . The company , which makes hydroxychloroquine &amp;mdash ; a drug most often used to treat malaria and rheumatoid arthritis &amp;mdash ; will be donating one million doses of the drug to Canadian hospitals in hopes they can help alleviate symptoms for those suffering from mild to severe effects of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; From what we&amp;rsquo ; re reading , I think the powers that be in the health-care sector are going to use it for patients who are hospitalized at a certain stage of the disease , &amp;rdquo ; said Bruno M&amp;auml ; der , a spokesperson for JAMP Pharma Group . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The drug gained unexpected notoriety last week when U.S. President Donald Trump said in a news conference that it was approved by that country&amp;rsquo ; s Food and Drug Administration to fight the disease . The FDA later issued a statement that it had not approved the drug . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; For sure , it&amp;rsquo ; s still experimental use for COVID-19 , &amp;rdquo ; M&amp;auml ; der said . &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re not telling people to use this drug ; we&amp;rsquo ; re not claiming it&amp;rsquo ; s a miracle drug . We&amp;rsquo ; re doing our part and we&amp;rsquo ; re providing the drug . We trust the good judgment and care of physicians and pharmacists to decide if it&amp;rsquo ; s the appropriate thing for the patients they will be treating . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In LaSalle , Labatt Breweries is shifting some of its production from beer to hand sanitizers . Other Labatt facilities in Vancouver , Edmonton and London will also be producing the sanitizer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Charlie Angelakos , Labatt&amp;rsquo ; s vice-president of legal and corporate affairs , explained that owner company InBev has already produced sanitizer in Mexico , Brazil and other countries . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Made from 80 per cent alcohol content , the &lt;a href= " http : **34;147691;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Labatt-branded sanitizer bottles&lt;/a&gt; will not be sold , Angelakos said , but given out to all employees who deliver and sell beer . It will also be donated to food-bank workers across the country and given to cooks and delivery personnel of restaurants who bring take-out food to homes . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Angelakos said the sanitizer does not smell like beer . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **28;147727;TOOLONG " **35;147757;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " http : **25;147794;TOOLONG " &gt;twit ... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " http : **34;147821;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " **31;147857;TOOLONG ... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;147890;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;147932;TOOLONG ... all our coverage on the **32;147967;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;148001;TOOLONG ... list of essential services that can remain **25;148036;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " http : **34;148063;TOOLONG ... timeline of the novel coronavirus in **27;148099;TOOLONG &lt;/ul&gt; Jason Magder , Montreal GazetteTue , 24 Mar 2020 11:39:48 **45;148128;TOOLONG ...

The city has pledged to cover during this period the interest on those loans , estimated to be $1.3 million , benefiting 700 businesses . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The $5 million emergency fund is aimed at providing subsidies to neighbourhood stores , the tourism industry as well as enterprises involved in culture and the arts . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Some of the most iconic economic sectors of our metropolis are the first to suffer the consequences of the virus , &amp;rdquo ; Plante said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; However , details of the emergency fund or how to apply for subsidies are still unclear . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In addition , the city is setting aside $1 million to support Montreal businesses that come up with innovative initiatives during the pandemic . Plante cited as an example some businesses that have teamed up to launch a delivery service . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Plante conceded that the city&amp;rsquo ; s measures alone are not enough , but she was confident business owners will be able to pull through with financial support from the &lt;a href= " https : **33;148936;TOOLONG ... and &lt;a href= " https : **33;148971;TOOLONG ... governments . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Plante also declared that most municipal employees &amp;mdash ; with the exception of essential services like the police , garbage collection and the fire department &amp;mdash ; will be required to work from home as early as Friday .

Emergency measures to help companies replenish their working capital will include loans and loan guarantees , Fitzgibbon said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Many businesses are suffering , &amp;rdquo ; Legault told reporters at the news conference . &amp;ldquo ; Our government will be there to help , but we won&amp;rsquo ; t be able to save all the companies . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The premier singled out aerospace , hotels and services as industries suffering &amp;ldquo ; catastrophic&amp;rdquo ; drops in revenue . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; This is a temporary crisis , &amp;rdquo ; Legault said . &amp;ldquo ; At some point , the economy will restart . We don&amp;rsquo ; t know when . We know it won&amp;rsquo ; t be in the next few weeks . It will take a certain number of months . So companies need to be able to bridge the gap . We need the maximum number of companies to get through this difficult period . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; All industries are eligible for the emergency program . Low-interest loans and loan guarantees of at least $50,000 will be offered , Fitzgibbon said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The move &amp;ldquo ; will help businesses breathe easier for a while , &amp;rdquo ; said Fran&amp;ccedil ; ois Vincent , vice-president for Quebec at the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , which recently warned that one out of every four small companies could close as a result of the crisis . &amp;ldquo ; All government assistance is welcome . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To be considered , businesses must be able to demonstrate that they will be able to turn a profit after the coronavirus crisis , Fitzgibbon said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Investissement Qu&amp;eacute ; bec is already evaluating more than 600 requests for financial assistance , the minister added . The government agency will also loosen terms for existing borrowers , he said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; This is an unprecedented shock&amp;rdquo ; for the economy , Fitzgibbon said . &amp;ldquo ; The crisis is severe . We know full well that many companies are already running out of cash , and especially in the regions . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Added Girard : &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re seeing disruption , interruption&amp;rdquo ; in the economy . &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s not destruction . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If more than $2.5 billion is required to help companies , &amp;ldquo ; we will provide more , &amp;rdquo ; Fitzgibbon added . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Quebec is working with banks and the federal government to co-ordinate assistance programs for companies , Fitzgibbon said . Ottawa unveiled $10 billion worth of measures for companies on Wednesday as part of an &lt;a href= " https : **33;149731;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;$82 billion stimulus package&lt;/a&gt; , and Fitzgibbon said he understands the Business Development Bank of Canada and Export Development Canada will be ready to step in and support small businesses . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Other players , such as property owners , will also be asked to lend a hand . Fitzgibbon said Ivanho&amp;eacute ; Cambridge , the real estate unit of the Caisse de d&amp;eacute ; p&amp;ocirc ; t et placement du Qu&amp;eacute ; bec , plans to give small businesses at its shopping centres a six-month moratorium on rent . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To support the economy , Legault urged Quebecers to prioritize buying local products , even when they shop online . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; More than ever , we need to be able to encourage Quebec companies , &amp;rdquo ; the premier said . &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s essential if we are to maximize the odds of our companies getting through this crisis . Whenever possible , please buy locally . It will help Quebec workers . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Help for individuals is also on the way . Legault said the government&amp;rsquo ; s economic committee was scheduled to meet Thursday night to consider other ways to assist Quebecers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the meantime , Quebec is harmonizing some tax measures with those of the federal government . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For instance , Quebec is &lt;a href= " http : **34;149766;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;postponing the deadline&lt;/a&gt; for individuals and businesses to pay any tax balance due and tax instalments to Sept. 1 &amp;mdash ; a move that Girard said would inject $8.3 billion of liquidity into the provincial economy . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Health is our priority , but Quebecers need to keep feeding themselves , to keep lodging themselves , to keep living , &amp;rdquo ; Legault said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **29;149802;TOOLONG " target= " blank " rel= " noopener " **36;149833;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;149871;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;149913;TOOLONG ... businesses welcome federal emergency aid as a good first **25;149948;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;149975;TOOLONG ... all our coverage on the **32;150010;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;150044;TOOLONG ...

All our daily and weekly routines have changed , and it&amp;rsquo ; s no longer possible to say with certainty what the outcome will be after this outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 is finally contained . The pandemic has touched every aspect of our lives &amp;mdash ; real estate included . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A lot of people are worried right now . In addition to worrying about catching the virus itself , many people fear they&amp;rsquo ; ll have trouble making rent or mortgage payments . On top of that , those living on or near the waterfront are probably wondering whether this will be another flood year . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If these things are on your mind , here&amp;rsquo ; s what you need to know : &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do n't wait to call your bank if you are struggling to make ends meet due to pandemic-related income loss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The most important thing is to talk to your lender as soon as you know you will have trouble making your mortgage payments . According to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation ( &lt;a href= " https : **33;150433;TOOLONG ... , you can work with your lender to come up with options to manage payments if you&amp;rsquo ; re having trouble making mortgage payments because of income loss : &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your options could include : &lt;/p&gt; **30;150468;TOOLONG a temporary deferral of interest payments&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Refinancing to take advantage of interest rate cuts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Asking if you can extend the amortization of your mortgage to lower payments&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Adding missed payments to the mortgage balance to spread out the cost over a longer period&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Negotiating other flexible repayment options&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you are employed full-time , you can also apply to have unemployment benefits fast-tracked due to COVID-19 .

For the moment it&amp;rsquo ; s still unclear , however , whether evictions that have already been ordered will go through . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you are planning to leave your apartment , and your landlord wants to show it , it&amp;rsquo ; s a good idea to insist that anyone touring your apartment take extra precautions : have them wash hands when they enter and exit , and have everyone wear a face mask if possible . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you live in a flood zone , you need to make your own emergency plan &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Those living in low-lying areas near the river have more than one disaster to plan for . The Quebec government has announced that due to the need to maintain social distance , if there is another round of flooding this spring , the government will not be able to open &lt;a href= " https : **33;150605;TOOLONG ... shelters&lt;/a&gt; as they have in previous years . Residents in high-risk areas are advised to plan now for what they will do if their property is flooded again . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s important to note that no one is certain that there **25;150640;TOOLONG be flooding in the spring , but we can&amp;rsquo ; t rule it out .

Transat&lt;/a&gt; said it would halt operations for about six weeks as countries close their borders in a bid to slow the spread of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Subject to further government restrictions , Air Canada said it intends to continue to serve a small number of international and U.S. transborder destinations from select Canadian cities after April 1 . It also plans to continue serving all Canadian provinces and territories after that date , though with a significantly reduced network . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To facilitate repatriations , Air Canada plans to keep operating a limited number of international &amp;ldquo ; air bridges&amp;rdquo ; between one or more of its Canadian hubs and the cities of London , Paris , Frankfurt , Delhi , Tokyo and Hong Kong from April 1 until at least April 30 . This will cut its international network from 101 airports to six . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Air Canada will continue to serve all Canadian provinces and territories , though its domestic network will shrink to 40 airports from 62 . In the U.S. , Air Canada now plans to serve 13 airports instead of 53 . Remaining U.S. destinations will include New York , &amp;nbsp ; Chicago , &amp;nbsp ; San Francisco and Los Angeles , the airline said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Air travel restrictions are &amp;ldquo ; having a cataclysmic effect upon the global airline industry , &amp;rdquo ; Air Canada chief executive officer Calin Rovinescu said in the statement . &amp;ldquo ; We are working around the clock to deal with the impact for our customers and our business of the various travel restrictions that are being made by governments at unprecedented speed without advance warning . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over at Air Transat , sales for departures until April 30 are suspended immediately from and to most destinations in Europe and the U.S. , parent company Transat A.T .

Efforts to secure government help are continuing , Eustache said in the memo . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sales are also halted immediately to and from Mexico and the Caribbean , though flights will continue for a few more days to repatriate customers to Canada , Transat said . Canadian travellers who were scheduled to fly in the coming days should postpone their departure , the company added . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Transat customers who are now at destinations are asked to check the company&amp;rsquo ; s website , where information about plans for their return will be posted . Booking fees will be eliminated , Transat said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It is of the utmost importance to Transat to bring everyone back , &amp;rdquo ; the company said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As it prepares to shut its system , Transat said Wednesday it would soon begin temporary layoffs , reduce working hours and wages &amp;mdash ; a move the company says will affect &amp;ldquo ; a significant portion of our employees . &amp;rdquo ; Senior executives and board members are also taking pay cuts . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Official layoff notifications will be sent out to most employees on Friday , Eustache said in the memo . Compensation of non-union employees will cease on Sunday . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Please believe that we sincerely regret having to make these decisions , &amp;rdquo ; Eustache told employees . &amp;ldquo ; But they are essential to enable the company to get through this crisis and to rebuild itself subsequently . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To preserve liquidity , Transat has already stopped all discretionary spending , eliminated some flights , contacted airplane lessors to negotiate payment deferrals and replaced wide-body aircraft with narrow-body jets on several routes . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;151225;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;151267;TOOLONG ... may need $200 billion in aid after coronavirus pandemic : **25;151302;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;151329;TOOLONG ...

Today , as the world 's airlines face a cataclysm caused by the COVID-19 pandemic , memories of the post-9/11 period come to mind . But this crisis is far worse . Within a period of a few weeks , airlines have seen passenger demand completely collapse . For most carriers , the market for air travel is actually below zero -- the number of people cancelling flights exceeds the number of new bookings . That is not surprising , given that more than 100 governments have closed their borders to foreign visitors and/or imposed lengthy quarantines that have the same practical effect . &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;As airlines ' ticket sales disappear , so does the daily cash intake from those sales , which even the most well-capitalized airlines need to pay their bills . Unfortunately , the bills have n't gone away , although the revenue to pay them has . Airlines are doing everything they can to slow the steady outflow of cash . They are grounding hundreds of aircraft , eliminating services and in some cases imposing salary reductions and furloughing employees . In desperation , some are hoping to outlast the crisis by shutting down entirely . &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;The economic damage to the industry , its employees and its supplier base , is immense ; and because aviation does not exist in a vacuum , the harm will extend into virtually every corner of our globally connected economy . The fact is that the modern world is built on aviation connectivity . Aviation supports US$2.7 trillion in economic activity , equivalent to 3.6 per cent of global GDP . Furthermore , the world 's airlines employ some 2.7 million people . Each one of these 2.7 million dedicated individuals helps to create another 24 jobs in the air transport- and tourism-related industries , such as jobs in hotels , and restaurants , theme parks and museums . That works out to 65.5 million jobs around the globe that are connected to airlines . &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;In Canada , 633,000 jobs are supported by the air transport sector , with a gross value-added contribution of US $49 billion . A whopping 3.2% per cent of Canada 's GDP is supported by air transport and by foreign tourists arriving in Canada by air . The disruptions to air travel caused by COVID-19 put at risk about 60,000 jobs and $4.4 billion in economic activity supported by the air transport industry in Canada . &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Time is fast running out for governments to step in to help . IATA has estimated that the typical airline had just two months of cash at the start of the year and the latest available figures suggest that global air passenger numbers for March are down 50 per cent from a year ago . Support measures are urgently needed . On a global basis , our initial estimate is that emergency aid of up to $200 billion is required . This should include things such as direct financial support to compensate for reduced ticket revenue that is directly attributable to travel restrictions . Government or central bank-backed loans and/or loan guarantees will also help , as will temporary tax relief and rebates on taxes paid this year . In combination , these measures will provide airlines with critical breathing space until the crisis recedes . And where restrictions on entry/exit and quarantines make air services untenable , it is appropriate that governments should suspend consumer regulations that make airlines financially liable for cancellations and schedule changes . &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;I call aviation the business of freedom , because it liberates us from the constraints of time , distance and geography and creates opportunities for greater understanding among cultures . Even today , in its weakened state , it is aviation that is transporting doctors , nurses and much-needed medicine and testing kits , into the areas hit hardest by COVID-19 . When it needs to get there fast , it goes by air . The window for firm government action is closing . An industry whose raison d ' ? tre is connecting people , cultures and commerce can not long survive under today 's conditions . And the world will be a much poorer place for it . &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Alexandre de Juniac is director general and CEO of the International Air Transport Association . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;153010;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;153052;TOOLONG ... may need $200 billion in aid after coronavirus pandemic : **25;153087;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;153114;TOOLONG ... all our coverage on the **32;153149;TOOLONG &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;&lt;b&gt;Note to readers : &lt;/b&gt; We know the speed and volume of coronavirus-related news is overwhelming and a little frightening .

Unless governments step in urgently with financial assistance , bankruptcies are inevitable , added IATA head Alexandre de Juniac. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We are in a very , very tough liquidity crisis , so we ask the governments to act urgently , &amp;rdquo ; de Juniac said on a conference call with reporters . &amp;ldquo ; We understand that many other economic sectors are heavily touched , but we think that connectivity is crucial in maintaining economic activity . Connectivity is also crucial to ensure that the recovery will be fast and significant . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Asked about the magnitude of an eventual bailout , de Juniac said : &amp;ldquo ; We should envisage something like US$150-to-200 billion . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; IATA is seeking aid to compensate for lost revenue , including loans , as well as tax relief in the form of a suspension in payroll taxes , de Juniac said . The group is also asking governments to reduce charges such as landing or navigation fees . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; If this crisis continues at that intensity , it is clear that we will see a restructuring of this industry , and probably a consolidation , with unfortunately some airlines disappearing , &amp;rdquo ; de Juniac said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; U.S. airlines require about $50 billion in aid , as grants , loans and tax relief , industry group &lt;a href= " https : **33;153573;TOOLONG ... for America said yesterday&lt;/a&gt; . Closer to home , Air Canada and &lt;a href= " https : **33;153608;TOOLONG ... Transat&lt;/a&gt; have both urged governments in recent days to help the airline industry . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Global passenger traffic will likely drop &amp;ldquo ; significantly further&amp;rdquo ; this year than the 16-per-cent decline previously estimated by IATA , Pearce said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The progression of the virus has been such that IATA&amp;rsquo ; s worst-case scenario , which projected a global passenger revenue loss of $113 billion this year , is already obsolete , Pearce said . The group only released the forecast last week . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; IATA&amp;rsquo ; s estimate is &amp;ldquo ; undoubtedly too low , &amp;rdquo ; Pearce said . The virtual closure of all North Atlantic routes , a $20-billion-a-year passenger revenue market , has made matters worse , he said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; In many cases , demand for the business of airlines has fallen to zero , &amp;rdquo ; Pearce said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As Canada &lt;a href= " https : **33;153643;TOOLONG ... to close its borders&lt;/a&gt; to most non-citizens , WestJet Airlines became the latest Canadian carrier to curtail operations Monday night when it &lt;a href= " https : **33;153678;TOOLONG ... the suspension&lt;/a&gt; of all transborder and international flights for 30 days as of midnight Sunday . It also said it would cut domestic capacity by 50 per cent , also for the next 30 days . The move follows Air Canada&amp;rsquo ; s announcement of a 50-per-cent reduction in capacity during the second quarter . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many global airlines are operating close to breakeven or at a net loss , IATA said . What&amp;rsquo ; s worse , the vast majority of carriers still have high levels of debt , meaning that much of their costs are fixed . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Bankruptcy &amp;ldquo ; is clearly a risk because airlines are running out of cash , &amp;rdquo ; Pearce said . &amp;ldquo ; They won&amp;rsquo ; t be able to sustain operations . Even before COVID-19 , the industry was in a fairly fragile position . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **29;153713;TOOLONG " **36;153744;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;153782;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;153824;TOOLONG ... to close borders to most non-citizens , stop ill travellers from boarding inbound flights , PM **30;153859;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;153891;TOOLONG ...

As the full impact and duration of the outbreak is unknown , Air Canada is scrapping its previously announced first-quarter and full-year 2020 guidance , as well as its 2021 targets , while trying to mitigate the financial impact on its business . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To preserve cash , Air Canada is starting a company-wide cost-cutting and capital deferral program &amp;mdash ; including workforce reductions &amp;mdash ; with a view to saving at least $500 million . Having suspended share buybacks and drawn down its US$600-million revolving credit facility , Air Canada said it&amp;rsquo ; s working with several unidentified parties to raise additional liquidity in the next several weeks . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We consider this to be a proactive move designed to take advantage of liquidity available to it , rather than as a result of a desperate near-term need , &amp;rdquo ; Walter Spracklin , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto , said Monday in a note to clients . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Investors aren&amp;rsquo ; t so sure . Air Canada closed down 28 per cent to $18.23 Monday in Toronto amid a broad-based selloff in global stocks . The shares have now lost about 60 per cent of their value in the past month . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Air Canada isn&amp;rsquo ; t commenting for now on how many people will be laid off as a result of the cutbacks , a spokeswoman said via email . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; COVID-19 presents the global airline industry with unprecedented challenges , compounded by uncertainty as to the extent of its effects , &amp;rdquo ; chief executive officer Calin Rovinescu said in the statement . &amp;ldquo ; However , we are confident that after a decade of transformation and record results , Air Canada today has the agility , the team and the route network to successfully navigate this crisis . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Projected cost reductions , coupled with the significant drop in jet fuel prices seen in recent weeks , will allow the company to mitigate as much as 60 per cent of lost revenue , according to Air Canada estimates . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Including proceeds from the U.S. dollar credit facility drawdown , Air Canada had cash , cash equivalents and investments of $7.1 billion at March 13 . The company also has a $200-million revolving credit facility that it plans to draw down in the next week . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Air Canada recently cut the size of its 2013 order with Boeing by cancelling eleven 737 Max jets that were due to be delivered in 2023 and 2024 . Air Canada also said Monday it concluded negotiations with Boeing regarding the grounding of the 737 Max , though confidentiality restrictions prevent the carrier from disclosing terms of the settlement . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Like leisure carrier Air Transat last week , Air Canada on Monday urged the federal government to step in with an assistance package for the airline industry . Possible steps include forbearance of taxes , landing fees and other charges until the industry stabilizes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Air Canada&amp;rsquo ; s move follows similar measures by such carriers as Germany&amp;rsquo ; s Lufthansa , which recently announced a long-haul capacity reduction of as much as 90 per cent . In the U.S. , American Airlines is cutting 75 per cent of long-haul international flights , while United Airlines said it would shut down half of its system . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Montreal-based Air Transat , which Air Canada is in the process of buying , is also scaling back service &amp;mdash ; though it won&amp;rsquo ; t say what percentage of capacity is being affected . Air Transat&amp;rsquo ; s website lists 20 flights that have been cancelled , including Montreal-St-Maarten and Vancouver-London. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; WestJet Airlines , Air Canada&amp;rsquo ; s biggest domestic rival , has said it&amp;rsquo ; s &amp;ldquo ; evaluating all available measures&amp;rdquo ; to secure its &amp;ldquo ; financial viability&amp;rdquo ; &amp;mdash ; including layoffs &amp;mdash ; after experiencing a significant reduction in demand . Early capacity estimates point to reductions of at least 60 per cent in international capacity and at least 40 per cent domestically . WestJet plans to provide more specific figures early this week . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The current situation is unprecedented and has escalated rapidly in the past week , &amp;rsquo ; &amp;rsquo ; executive vice-president Mark Porter said in a statement . &amp;ldquo ; We are reviewing several options to reduce costs , including reduction in contractors , a pause on many of our capital projects and asking vendors for pricing cuts . Unfortunately , we also have no alternative but to reduce the number of employees . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; WestJet employees will be asked to consider voluntary leaves , unpaid vacation and reduced work time among other voluntary measures , Porter said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **29;155884;TOOLONG " **36;155915;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;155953;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;155995;TOOLONG ... wants Quebec 's help to cope with coronavirus-led drop in **29;156030;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;156061;TOOLONG ... all our coverage on the **32;156096;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;156130;TOOLONG ...

Then came entertainment , sports events and conventions being cancelled . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Ritz is also a popular destination for visiting NHL clubs , not to mention visiting entertainers , actors and production personnel as well as business execs from around the globe . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Everyone I&amp;rsquo ; ve talked to in the business across the country has also been effected . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He pointed out that the hotel had been taking an intensive pro-active safety approach for a while , with doorknobs to key-cards being constantly scrubbed and hand sanitizers being placed everywhere . The hotel&amp;rsquo ; s acclaimed restaurant Maison Boulud has been shut down for cautionary reasons . As a consequence , staffing levels are also down , with employees on temporary leave . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;156715;TOOLONG ... title= " Shoppers and a renovation work crew are shown at Fairview shopping mall in Pointe-Claire at lunchtime on Monday , March 16 , 2020.

If we don&amp;rsquo ; t do this now , then we&amp;rsquo ; ll have another Italy , and that could be the end for so many and so much . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s a two-way street for tourism . They&amp;rsquo ; re not coming here , and we&amp;rsquo ; re not going there . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Travel agent Genevi&amp;egrave ; ve Stachtchenko conceded she hasn&amp;rsquo ; t made &amp;ldquo ; a penny&amp;rdquo ; for a few weeks . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; No one is going anywhere these days , &amp;rdquo ; she said . &amp;ldquo ; All I&amp;rsquo ; m doing now is cancelling tickets and reservations and trying to get refunds for customers . Or else trying to get snowbird customers booked to come back later to come back now , but that&amp;rsquo ; s been so tough with many of those flights booked or being cut back . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; If I don&amp;rsquo ; t get some customers out from France within 48 hours , they could be facing many weeks of quarantine when they get back here . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Stachtchenko can&amp;rsquo ; t recall business ever being this abysmal . Not even around 9/11. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I was actually booking a lot of people then , but I can&amp;rsquo ; t see anyone booking for at least another month . Still , I&amp;rsquo ; m sure I&amp;rsquo ; m far from the only one with zero income these days . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; No doubt . There&amp;rsquo ; s an eerie emptiness at downtown shops . So many businesses have curtailed operations for the time being , even though they aren&amp;rsquo ; t required to do so . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; There&amp;rsquo ; s no customers coming , so what&amp;rsquo ; s the point of staying open ? &amp;rdquo ; said one salesperson , whose shop was in the midst of closing . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Boutique Tozzi manager Ismael Oblitas acknowledged that business at his Crescent St. shop had slowed down and he was anticipating more of a downturn in the next two weeks . But he echoed the sentiments of other retailers offering a solution to those uneasy about showing up in person . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The best short-term solution would be to support businesses like ours and so many others through our online platforms , &amp;rdquo ; he said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The strategy appears to be working . Canada Post mailman Tony Francescangeli has seen a huge upsurge of late in home deliveries of parcels from Amazon and other online operators : &amp;ldquo ; Neither snow nor rain , nor sleet nor heat , and , now , coronavirus can deter these packages from being delivered . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lufa , the food delivery system with its urban rooftop vegetable farms , has , not surprisingly , also received a major sales boost . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even though restaurants are permitted to stay open , albeit in diminished capacity , many are now shutting down entirely . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Time Out Market in the Eaton Centre announced that it will be closing down temporarily as of Tuesday . Also starting Tuesday , Tim Hortons will close indoor seating at its outlets , offering only take-out , drive-thru and delivery . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Other restos , which have closed or planning to do , are also considering a similar tack , in providing take out service . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re looking into it , &amp;rdquo ; said Stephen Leslie , whose two popular restaurants , Tavern on the Square and Monkland Tavern , are both closed . &amp;ldquo ; But the situation is ever evolving , changing from hour to hour . It&amp;rsquo ; s nuts . I&amp;rsquo ; m now been hearing rumours about the SAQ closing . If that happens , there will be tough days ahead for many . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Not everyone is bemoaning bad business . With interest rates about as low as they&amp;rsquo ; ve been and with many wishing not to place their cash in the stock market , they are choosing brick and mortar investments instead . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; That happened during the financial crisis in 2008 , and I can see it happening now , &amp;rdquo ; noted Joseph Montanaro , among the city&amp;rsquo ; s premier real-estate agents . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He reports having completed 10 offers for homes during spring break . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I haven&amp;rsquo ; t been seeing panic in real estate . In fact , I foresee an amazing season , especially if they slash the interest rates even further , which I think they will . There are many taking advantage of the opportunities . It&amp;rsquo ; s going to make a hot market even hotter . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; But nothing is gained anywhere if people keep freaking out .

Employees who travel for personal reasons will be required to observe a 14-day isolation period at home . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Participation in professional public events &amp;mdash ; including conferences and training sessions &amp;mdash ; is prohibited until further notice . Public events that were due to be held on the parquet at the Caisse&amp;rsquo ; s downtown Montreal building are cancelled until May 31 at the earliest . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Caisse&amp;rsquo ; s ban doesn&amp;rsquo ; t apply to a handful of &amp;ldquo ; critical business functions , &amp;rdquo ; for which a &amp;ldquo ; safe work environment&amp;rdquo ; will be implemented . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Hydro-Qu&amp;eacute ; bec also says some key employees &amp;mdash ; such as line repairmen &amp;mdash ; won&amp;rsquo ; t be asked to stay home , because of the critical nature of their role . The electric utility has about 1,700 people working at its Montreal headquarters , &amp;ldquo ; hundreds&amp;rdquo ; of whom are now working from home , spokesman Cendrix Bouchard said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Videotron said Friday it will automatically lift data limits for its current residential and business internet customers until the end of March to allow more people to work from home . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; That way , all current customers of Videotron&amp;rsquo ; s residential and business internet service won&amp;rsquo ; t have to worry about their consumption , as if they had an unlimited plan , &amp;rdquo ; the Quebecor Inc. cable and internet unit said in a statement . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At Fonds de solidarit&amp;eacute ; FTQ , the province&amp;rsquo ; s biggest labour-sponsored fund , the work-from-home guidelines only apply to staffers who recently returned from &amp;ldquo ; at risk&amp;rdquo ; countries or are feeling symptoms of the virus , according to David Labrosse , a spokesman . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Employees who were planning to travel over the next few weeks are being asked to cancel or delay their trips . Any penalties or cancellation fees will be paid for by the Fonds , Labrosse said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the meantime , the Fonds said it&amp;rsquo ; s &amp;ldquo ; ready to work with the governments of Quebec and Canada , as well as other players in the Quebec financial network , to support the economy . &amp;rdquo ; The Fonds had net assets of $16.7 billion as of late November . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Public health must be everyone&amp;rsquo ; s priority , &amp;rdquo ; chief executive officer Ga&amp;eacute ; tan Morin said in a &lt;a href= " https : **33;157546;TOOLONG ... . &amp;ldquo ; Under current circumstances , however , it is quite possible that Quebec businesses will experience liquidity-related issues .

Yet . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A week ago at noon , you almost needed a crowbar to elbow your way through the hungry hordes at the &lt;a href= " https : **33;158270;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Time Out Market&lt;/a&gt; in the Eaton Centre . But Friday at noon this week , you could have tossed a crowbar at the market entrance and probably would not have struck anyone . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Then again , you could have rolled a bowling ball through some of the floors of the Eaton Centre , Place Montreal Trust and Les Cours Mont-Royal and not done much damage , either . Were it not for the sales staffs , most of the boutiques would have been otherwise empty Friday at lunch hour . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Talk about social distancing by default . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In fairness , however , downtown businesses really didn&amp;rsquo ; t have much of a chance at lunch hour : The weather was miserable until later Friday afternoon . Schools , sporting events and cultural activities were &amp;mdash ; pick your synonym &amp;mdash ; paused , postponed , cancelled or suspended . Also , there were many in adjacent office buildings who had been told/ordered to work at home . Plus , given the ever-volatile stock market , financial insecurity had to have had an impact on consumers . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And , oh yeah , there was the raison d&amp;rsquo ; &amp;ecirc ; tre for all the aforementioned developments : &lt;a href= " https : **33;158305;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;the coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Still , business was extremely brisk at a couple of downtown spots &amp;mdash ; namely supermarkets and drug stores ( despite the fact that those pharmacies checked had no hand-sanitizers in stock , much to the chagrin of shoppers ) . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But , without question , the biggest lineup spotted , a half-block long in the pouring rain , was outside the Ste-Catherine St. W. &lt;a href= " https : **33;158340;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;SQDC pot shop&lt;/a&gt; . Coincidence ? I think not . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We are entering uncharted territory . And this is but the beginning . Some have speculated the whole city could soon be put in lockdown if the pandemic worsens. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Steve , a manager at one Eaton Centre shop , pointed out that business had been fine until Thursday : &amp;ldquo ; Then , boom , it just died right down . Obviously , it&amp;rsquo ; s the fear of the coronavirus , and so much being shut down in the city . It&amp;rsquo ; s spooky , but I think people are getting overexcited. &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Julia , a cook at one of the most popular Time Out Market stalls , just hopes to keep working : &amp;ldquo ; Everything was great , and then just this week , it had all changed . Now I&amp;rsquo ; m hearing stories the market may even have to shut down for a bit . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Steve , a manager at another market hotspot , also heard this rumour : &amp;ldquo ; Maybe even by Monday . Something has to give . We can&amp;rsquo ; t operate with full staffs and few customers . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In fact , there is no plan to close . Time Out Market issued this official statement Friday afternoon : &amp;ldquo ; We are dedicated to creating an environment that is as safe as possible . Therefore , we have implemented and intensified precautionary measures . &amp;hellip ; We are continuing to monitor the situation and to take advice from local governments and health authorities . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Time Out regular Rob Hiscock , a financial analyst who works nearby , understands the current concerns . &amp;ldquo ; One has to be cautious and try to avoid large crowds , which won&amp;rsquo ; t be a problem today and which is why I came , &amp;rdquo ; he said . &amp;nbsp ; &amp;ldquo ; Normally , this market is packed to the rafters . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Business was more bustling at &lt;a href= " https : **33;158375;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Le Cathcart food hall in Place Ville Marie&lt;/a&gt; . There were lineups at the quick takeout kiosks , but fewer customers at the sit-down restos. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Waiting patiently in line at one of the kiosks was Claude St-Hilaire , a financial consultant working in an upstairs PVM office . This was to be his last lunch at the hall for a spell . &amp;ldquo ; This is my last day here , because we just got the &lt;a href= " https : **33;158410;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;word we all have to work from home starting next week&lt;/a&gt; , &amp;rdquo ; he said . &amp;nbsp ; &amp;ldquo ; It may look busy here now , but it&amp;rsquo ; s actually quite quiet . It&amp;rsquo ; s usually three times more crowded than this at lunch . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Business looked bleaker at restaurants and boutiques along Ste-Catherine St. But Regine Kadoch , assistant manager at Ernest , tried to sound a more upbeat tone . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s slow , but people are just being diligent in protecting themselves and others , &amp;rdquo ; she said . &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; ve lived through so much , but we can&amp;rsquo ; t live in fear . We&amp;rsquo ; ll live through this , too , as long as we don&amp;rsquo ; t panic and don&amp;rsquo ; t have people fighting for toilet paper , of all things . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Longtime Winnie&amp;rsquo ; s bartender Donna Cotton saw her regular lunchtime crowd almost completely dissipated Friday : &amp;ldquo ; There are few regulars and &lt;a href= " https : **33;158445;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;almost no students&lt;/a&gt; or tourists . I haven&amp;rsquo ; t seen the place this empty in years . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sam Tadros , owner of the Milsa restaurant chain , including one on Crescent St. , was also singing the coronavirus blues . Hotel and convention business he counts on have taken a huge hit . &amp;ldquo ; Business was already down 50 per cent last week , and it&amp;rsquo ; s going to get much worse , I&amp;rsquo ; m afraid . We&amp;rsquo ; ve had our share of problems downtown with construction and parking , but it&amp;rsquo ; s never been like this . And who knows when it will ever end ? &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ziggy&amp;rsquo ; s Pub owner Ziggy Eichenbaum saw dark clouds ahead , particularly with events at the &lt;a href= " https : **33;158480;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;nearby Bell Centre curtailed for now&lt;/a&gt; : &amp;ldquo ; There&amp;rsquo ; s no sports , period , even to watch at my bar . I figure business will be down about 60 to 70 per cent . These are scary times . It hasn&amp;rsquo ; t been slow like this since 9/11. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; But I did catch a lucky break Thursday night , &amp;rdquo ; he mused . &amp;ldquo ; Because their game with the Canadiens got cancelled and because they had nowhere to go until their flight left later that evening , I had the Buffalo Sabres team in . They had a few drinks and had a good time before flying off . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There will probably be no complaints of an economic slump at Adonis and nearby IGA in Alexis Nihon Plaza for now . Martha O&amp;rsquo ; Connor noted that customers , many wearing latex gloves , were in a near-manic state at both spots . &amp;nbsp ; She waited 30 minutes at the IGA checkout line to pay . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It was just nuts , &amp;rdquo ; she said . &amp;ldquo ; People were piling up on everything , from milk to toilet paper . It was like they were expecting World War III to break out . At this rate , one has to wonder how long the stock will hold out . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Hopefully , this madness ends soon . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **32;158515;TOOLONG " **39;158549;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; **26;158590;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;158618;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;158660;TOOLONG ... comprehensive coronavirus coverage , click here : &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " http : **34;158695;TOOLONG ... sign up for our coronavirus newsletter , click here : &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; Note to readers : We know the speed and volume of coronavirus-related news is overwhelming and a little frightening .

The CEO reiterated Thursday he still expects regulatory authorities here and in Europe to make a decision on the transaction by the end of June . He stressed Transat is under no obligation to renegotiate terms of the deal with Air Canada . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Bookings at Transat have plunged in the last three weeks , and are now down about 50 per cent compared with the period last year , chief operating officer Annick Gu&amp;eacute ; rard said at the same press conference . Almost all destinations are affected , she said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Feb. 24 was an inflection point , &amp;rdquo ; Gu&amp;eacute ; rard said . &amp;ldquo ; From that day on , sales started weakening and the gap between this year and last year has been widening daily . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To make matters more complicated , Air Transat must plan for emergency flights to repatriate stranded passengers . El Salvador &lt;a href= " https : **33;159060;TOOLONG ... its borders to foreign visitors&lt;/a&gt; overnight , forcing Air Transat to dispatch an empty jet Thursday to bring back Canadian passengers . Other border closures are highly likely in the short term , Gu&amp;eacute ; rard said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We can potentially envisage other countries in Central America that are going to tell us in the next few days they are closing their borders temporarily , &amp;rdquo ; she said . &amp;ldquo ; Central American counties don&amp;rsquo ; t necessarily have the medical infrastructure to cope with this kind of situation . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Short-term government support would make it easier for Transat to maintain employee wages , Gu&amp;eacute ; rard said . The company is asking authorities to lower fees such as airport taxes and air navigation charges , and wants regulators to accelerate their review of the Air Canada deal to remove unneeded uncertainty . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; This coronavirus situation is going to heighten the vulnerability of many airlines , so we&amp;rsquo ; re asking the authorities to speed up the regulatory process , &amp;rdquo ; Gu&amp;eacute ; rard said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To cut costs and preserve liquidity , Transat has stopped all discretionary spending , eliminated some flights , contacted airplane lessors to negotiate payment deferrals and replaced wide-body aircraft with narrow-body jets on several routes . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As of Jan. 31 , Transat had free cash of $682 million . The company also has unused credit facilities . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Capital expenditures have been frozen , meaning that several investment projects have been suspended . For instance , Transat has put a plan to hire 125 cabin crew staff on hold because the hiring spree hinged on a &amp;ldquo ; regular&amp;rdquo ; summer season , Gu&amp;eacute ; rard said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We are going to do what needs to be done to make sure we get through this difficult period , &amp;rdquo ; chief financial officer Denis P&amp;eacute ; trin said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Transat stock plunged 17 per cent to $10.59 in Toronto trading Thursday after the company disclosed an adjusted loss of $20.3 million for the fiscal first quarter and declined to provide a full-year profit outlook . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The shares are now trading 41 per cent below Air Canada&amp;rsquo ; s offer price of $18 a share , leading some analysts to question whether the transaction will close . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The deal &amp;ldquo ; now carries a question mark , &amp;rdquo ; Doug Taylor , an analyst at Canaccord Genuity in Toronto , said in a note to investors . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Transat is offering employees the possibility of a four-day work week or taking sabbaticals in a bid to avoid layoffs , Gu&amp;eacute ; rard said . Annual wages amount to about $400 million , she said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We are going to look at every potential solution to avoid temporary layoffs , &amp;rdquo ; Gu&amp;eacute ; rard said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Layoffs could potentially last one to three months , depending on the jurisdiction , she said . Executive salaries would also be reduced in the event of job cuts , she said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While Transat has a long history of coping with crises , whether it&amp;rsquo ; s the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , the SARS outbreak in 2003 or the H1N1 crisis in 2009 , executives say it&amp;rsquo ; s too early to evaluate the impact of the current pandemic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We don&amp;rsquo ; t know how deep this is going to go , how long it&amp;rsquo ; s going to last , &amp;rdquo ; Gu&amp;eacute ; rard said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **29;159095;TOOLONG " **36;159126;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;159164;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;159206;TOOLONG ... shareholders back sale to Air Canada , look to 2020 for regulatory **29;159241;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " http : **34;159272;TOOLONG ... timeline of the novel coronavirus in **27;159308;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;159337;TOOLONG ... all our coverage on the **32;159372;TOOLONG &lt;/ul&gt; Fr ? d ? ric TomescoThu , 12 Mar 2020 21:47:41 **45;159406;TOOLONG ...

My grandfather had been a successful fruit and vegetable purveyor , supplying some of the biggest restaurants and hotels in the city . When I was born , the last of the four children , we were living in a beautiful house in an upscale neighbourhood . My father was miserable . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When I was five , my father made the decision to sell the business and pursue a dream &amp;mdash ; to open a &lt;span class= " markhd392ec2i " &gt;magic&lt;/span&gt; &amp;nbsp ; shop . He&amp;rsquo ; d always loved&amp;nbsp ; &lt;span class= " markhd392ec2i " &gt;magic&lt;/span&gt; , but there had been other plans for him . The first location was the basement of our house . We had people in and out of there all the time . Customers who found us then are still with us today . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But a &lt;span class= " markhd392ec2i " &gt;magic&lt;/span&gt; shop doesn&amp;rsquo ; t support the kind of lifestyle we were living . We sold the house , moved to a working-class neighbourhood , rented a lower duplex and opened the shop in the basement there . When that became unsustainable , my parents opened a real shop on Van Horne Ave . in C&amp;ocirc ; te-des-Neiges , where they remain to this day . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;159655;TOOLONG ... title= " Evelyn and Phil Matlin pull a stuffed rabbit out of a hat at Perfect Magic , their magic store on Van Horne Ave. , on Aug. 4 , 1997.

" data-portal-copyright= " John Mahoney " **28;159690;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1746465 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; The adjustment was hard for me . I was young and couldn&amp;rsquo ; t understand my father sacrificing our luxury for a &lt;span class= " markhd392ec2i " &gt;magic&lt;/span&gt; shop . All I knew was that my friends had everything they wanted , and I did not . Throughout my adolescence and teenage years , I was self-absorbed and resentful of the situation . My father , on the other hand , was thriving . And he was around . Two things I failed to notice at the time . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Despite that one rather large obstacle , I&amp;rsquo ; ve always shared a close relationship with my parents . My mother is still the first person I turn to when something goes wrong &amp;mdash ; which , when you factor in the cancer , is really kind of selfish . And in the end , my father turned out to be a real role model for me &amp;mdash ; twice . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When I was in my early 20s , finishing up university , I set my sights on the film industry . It was such a ridiculous notion that even my mother , who encourages me in everything , tried to dissuade me . But I thought about the risks my father took , and decided to go all in . I ended up having a really satisfying 20-year career in the business , which I still have a toe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As I approached 40 , I went through a bit of a mid-life crisis . What started as a dream job had evolved into me supervising a team of people doing my dream job . Like my father before me , I was miserable . What I really wanted was to quit , stay home and be a writer . Because of the example my father set , that&amp;rsquo ; s what I did . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I&amp;rsquo ; m 48 now , and when people ask if I made the right call , I always say , &amp;ldquo ; I thought I&amp;rsquo ; d be somewhere else financially at this stage of my life , but I never dreamed I&amp;rsquo ; d be this happy . &amp;rdquo ; And , I realize , that&amp;rsquo ; s probably how my dad felt . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;159720;TOOLONG ... title= " Evelyn Matlin demonstrates a trick of the trade at Perfect Magic .

Even businesspeople tell me how doing &lt;span class= " markhd392ec2i " &gt;magic&lt;/span&gt; &amp;nbsp ; as a kid boosted their confidence , brought them out of their shell . &amp;nbsp ; &lt;span class= " markhd392ec2i " &gt;Magic&lt;/span&gt; &amp;nbsp ; is a balm for the soul and it never goes out of style . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And everyone has memories to share . They tell me about their first trip to the shop , and how my mom showed them their first card trick . How they loved the Saturday afternoon &lt;span class= " markhd392ec2i " &gt;magic&lt;/span&gt; shows and auctions . Their annual convention Magie Montreal , which attracted world-renowned &lt;span class= " markhd392ec2i " &gt;magic&lt;/span&gt; ians from around the globe between 1979 and 1998 , is fondly remembered and missed . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;159813;TOOLONG ... title= " Julie Matlin.

The very same ones I spent Sunday nights cutting and pasting with a hot wax roller ( these were the days before computers ) and wishing I was anywhere else . Those catalogues meant so much to so many people . It was their wish list , the reason they got part-time jobs , their means to putting together an act . My father gave that to them . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; People tell me how much they love my parents , how influential they were , and still are , in their lives . It&amp;rsquo ; s a strange feeling to discover that the two people who formed me shaped so many other lives along the way . It&amp;rsquo ; s a gift to know this , and to hear it so often .

It has also scrapped an additional childcare contribution and begun working toward the establishment of a single school tax rate &amp;mdash ; delivering on a key election pledge . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The new school tax cut will cost the government $182 million as soon as the fiscal year begins April 1 , budget documents show . Between 2020 and 2025 , total savings for taxpayers will amount to $1.2 billion , the government says . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Since fall 2018 , we have put considerable sums back in the pockets of Quebecers , and families have been the primary beneficiaries , &amp;rdquo ; Girard said Tuesday in his speech at the National Assembly . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Girard&amp;rsquo ; s budget is also setting aside about $532 million over five years to increase its refundable tax credit for informal caregivers , including $239 million to expand the program to 30,000 additional people . Caregivers will be eligible for the credit provided they look after relatives with &amp;ldquo ; severe and prolonged&amp;rdquo ; impairments or who are at least 70 years old . The credit will be expanded to 21,000 people with spouses under age 70 and 6,000 people who take care of people who are not relatives . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Quebec plans to release its first policy on caregivers this spring , the budget documents say .

It&amp;rsquo ; s also rolling out an incentive deduction for the commercialization of intellectual property that the government says could benefit almost 15,000 companies by greatly reducing their effective income tax rate . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; This is an intelligent budget that targets good priorities , &amp;rdquo ; Michel Leblanc , president of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal , told the Montreal Gazette Tuesday . &amp;ldquo ; We wanted the government to find the right mechanisms to foster innovation and especially investments in the improvement of productivity , and both components are there . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The innovation tax credit will cost the government about $526 million over five years . It will support more than 10,000 small businesses a year by 2025 , and will generate investments of up to $1.3 billion , the government said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The measure will encourage companies to acquire manufacturing and processing equipment , computer hardware and management software packages . It will cover up to 20 per cent of eligible investments . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The credit &amp;ldquo ; is a good measure for entrepreneurs . It&amp;rsquo ; s structuring , a very pragmatic move , &amp;rdquo ; said Charles Milliard , president of the F&amp;eacute ; d&amp;eacute ; ration des chambres de commerce du Qu&amp;eacute ; bec. &amp;ldquo ; There are two ways to boost productivity : you either invest in equipment or in the labour force . We find that this budget does very well with regards to equipment and machinery , but for the workforce , it&amp;rsquo ; s very timid . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Quebec estimates the intellectual property deduction will cost about $334 million over six years . It will support the marketing of innovations that represent annual revenues of $2.4 billion . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Once the measure kicks in , businesses that develop and commercialize intellectual property in the province will see their Quebec income tax rate for eligible income drop from 11.5 per cent to 2 per cent . Combined with federal taxes , the rate will drop from 26.5 to 17 per cent , making it the most competitive tax rate among jurisdictions in Canada and the United States , according to the government . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; This is an excellent move , &amp;rdquo ; Yves-Thomas Dorval , head of the Conseil du patronat , the province&amp;rsquo ; s biggest business lobby group , told the Montreal Gazette Tuesday in Quebec City . &amp;ldquo ; Here in Quebec , we generate a lot of R&amp;amp ; D but we are very weak when it comes to commercialization . We build stuff and we sell our expertise , which is marketed by bigger integrators elsewhere . So this measure clearly meets a need . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;162612;TOOLONG ... title= " " This is an intelligent budget that targets good priorities , " Michel Leblanc , president of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal , told the Montreal Gazette Tuesday .

Quebec estimates the extension will allow the province to attract more than 45 new large projects , representing investments of about $20 billion . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Still , business group representatives who spoke to the Montreal Gazette Tuesday said the budget falls short in a key area : reducing taxes that could have allowed companies to reinvest in higher wages and worker training . The $213 million that Girard has set aside to better integrate immigrants into the labour market , promote worker training and attract qualified foreign workers is insufficient , they say . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The biggest problem in Quebec is the labour shortage . The government could have made a major move on that front by reducing the payroll tax , but they didn&amp;rsquo ; t , &amp;rdquo ; said Dorval of the Conseil du patronat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Payroll taxes in Quebec are about 50 per cent higher than the Canadian average , and about 35 per cent higher than in Ontario , according to Conseil du patronat data . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Fran&amp;ccedil ; ois Vincent , vice-president for Quebec for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , also expressed disappointment at the lack of a tax break for companies . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Small businesses have been asking the government to reduce the tax burden and to solve the labour shortage , but on both fronts we see nothing , &amp;rdquo ; Vincent said in an interview . &amp;ldquo ; Small businesses are the economic engine of Quebec , and a tax reduction would have allowed them to raise wages or reimburse their debt .

Another route under study would run from the region of the C&amp;ocirc ; te-Vertu m&amp;eacute ; tro station at the end of the Orange Line in St-Laurent northward into Laval , and then branching east and west to cut across Laval. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The third route would run on the South Shore , between Longueuil and Brossard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The other electric systems being studied include linking the REM to the **29;163101;TOOLONG area , an electric line on Taschereau Blvd. and extension of the m&amp;eacute ; tro&amp;rsquo ; s Yellow Line on the South Shore , an electrified transit system for Quebec City and another between western Gatineau and downtown Ottawa .

The people have spoken . Pineapple has no place on pizza . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At least not at the city&amp;rsquo ; s B&amp;agrave ; caro Pizzeria chain . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Pineapple on pizza is against the natural order of things . It&amp;rsquo ; s like topping the pies with such other ill-advised ingredients as chicken , lobster and , horror of horrors , poutine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Montreal chef Angelo Mercuri , co-founder of B&amp;agrave ; caro , wanted to settle once and for all one of the more contentious and divisive of food debates regarding whether or not pineapple belongs on pizza . So he concocted the Hawaii 50 &amp;mdash ; consisting of pineapple , bacon , ricotta , jalapeno peppers and tomato sauce &amp;mdash ; which was made available at the 10 B&amp;agrave ; caro restos throughout February . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He then asked diners for their views on whether pineapple should stay on the menu . If they voted against , Mercuri vowed pineapple would be verboten and never spoke of again . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It was a massive campaign . B&amp;agrave ; caro went heavy on social media and even on billboards around town . More than 5,000 people took part in the survey , with 53 per cent voting no to pineapple . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It wasn&amp;rsquo ; t a resounding no , &amp;rdquo ; Mercuri says . &amp;ldquo ; I felt that it was going to be close . In fact , in the early stages , the yes side was winning , but then the no side came back strong and squeaked by . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Hmm &amp;hellip ; shades of another referendum in this province where ethnics may have also played a principal part in deciding the outcome ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; But democracy rules , and pineapple will never again show up on our menu , &amp;rdquo ; Mercuri adds . &amp;ldquo ; I knew people had strong views on the subject , but didn&amp;rsquo ; t realize just how strong they were . I never realized how passionate people could be about pineapple . Lots of arguments broke out . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But , fortunately , no fisticuffs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I had some people congratulating us for being so brave about our survey , but I also had people telling us that we couldn&amp;rsquo ; t ever consider ourselves a real Italian pizza place if we included pineapple , &amp;rdquo ; Mercuri says . &amp;ldquo ; Certainly my family in Italy would never have approved . At least now I won&amp;rsquo ; t have to hide my head in shame when I go back to Italy . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Then again , according to B&amp;agrave ; caro co-owner Tommaso Mul&amp;eacute ; , all the rage now with many young Italians is pizza with &amp;hellip ; ew &amp;hellip ; cut-up hot dogs and fries . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Heather Teich summed up the sentiments of many on the no side : &amp;ldquo ; Sorry , Italian pizza has no pineapples ! Keep it real ! NOT HAPPENING IN MY WORLD ! ! &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Categorically NO ! &amp;rdquo ; Simon Labrecque wrote . &amp;ldquo ; What&amp;rsquo ; s next ? Putting pineapple in p&amp;acirc ; t&amp;eacute ; Chinois ? &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The word &amp;ldquo ; heresy&amp;rdquo ; also popped up a lot . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; On the yes side , however , feelings also rang out rather favourably . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Nice exotic touch and marriage of flavours , &amp;rdquo ; Anna Muji marvelled. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s very clear , &amp;rdquo ; Sandra Restrepo echoed . &amp;ldquo ; Pineapples are a must ! Yes ! ! &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Mercuri also offered a grand prize to those who partook in the poll : a month&amp;rsquo ; s supply of free pizza to the voter whose name was drawn at the end of February . The winner was Carole Thiesen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; And she actually voted for us to keep going with pineapple , &amp;rdquo ; Mercuri says . &amp;ldquo ; Now she&amp;rsquo ; ll be able to get everything but pineapple for a month . Hopefully , we&amp;rsquo ; ll be able to convince her that she can get by without it . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As previously noted , the pineapple issue has split families , impacted relationships and even triggered an international incident . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Mercuri felt that a Canadian had to be the one to bring the debate to the forefront , since the creator of the pineapple-adorned pizza , best known as the Hawaiian , was a Greek-Canadian , Sam Panopoulos , who first brought it to life at his Chatham , Ont . Satellite Restaurant in 1962. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; ( In addition to the pineapple as well as the cheese and tomato sauce , the Hawaiian generally includes ham and/or bacon. ) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Pizza purists have long had issues with pineapple , but few more so than Iceland&amp;rsquo ; s President Gu&amp;eth ; ni Thorlacius J&amp;oacute ; hannesson , who had even proposed banning it in 2017 . To which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded in a Feb. 24 , 2017 , tweet : &amp;ldquo ; I have a pineapple . I have a pizza . And I stand behind this delicious Southwestern Ontario creation . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Personally , I&amp;rsquo ; m a bit bummed out , because I really liked the pineapple&amp;rdquo ; Mercuri says . &amp;ldquo ; And now I&amp;rsquo ; ll never be able to have it in my own restaurants . I guess I&amp;rsquo ; ll have to go out of province and wear a disguise to have it again . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **32;164142;TOOLONG " **39;164176;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " http : **28;164217;TOOLONG " target= " blank " rel= " noopener " **30;164247;TOOLONG &; ... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;164279;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;164321;TOOLONG ...

He was found guilty on five counts including fraud , corruption of foreign officials and laundering proceeds of crime . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Manoukian conceded she could find no precedent that would prevent the judge from ordering the fine be paid immediately . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The amount is unique , &amp;rdquo ; Cournoyer said , adding he has not reached a decision on the amount to be paid . &amp;ldquo ; This isn&amp;rsquo ; t something we see on a daily basis . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Cournoyer agreed to give lawyers on both sides less than two weeks to discuss the matter before he makes his decision .

More than $73 million was paid &amp;ldquo ; for the personal benefit of Ben Aissa and Bebawi. &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ben Aissa agreed to be a witness for the prosecution and testified during Bebawi&amp;rsquo ; s trial last year . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In a separate case , Ben Aissa pleaded guilty to helping fix SNC-Lavalin&amp;rsquo ; s bid to construct and maintain the McGill University Health Centre superhospital . He was sentenced to the equivalent of a 51-month prison term in 2018. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meanwhile , the Crown is seeking to confiscate more than $4.2 million worth of assets that Bebawi is believed to have amassed while he committed his crimes . That includes a condo in a gated community near a beach in Clearwater , Fla. , that is estimated to be worth more than U.S.$1.1 million , as well as a house in St-Lambert worth more than $970,000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Crown believes Bebawi sent more than U.S.$2.5 million to Egypt that it can not track down . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **28;164568;TOOLONG " **35;164598;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;164635;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;164677;TOOLONG ...

I often find that the data in the listing doesn&amp;rsquo ; t tell the full story of a property . For example , some three-bedroom homes have a fourth room in the basement that could be easily converted to another bedroom &amp;mdash ; yet these won&amp;rsquo ; t appear in my search listings if I&amp;rsquo ; ve said I only want to buy a four-bedroom property . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you&amp;rsquo ; re having &lt;a href= " https : **33;165082;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;trouble finding a home in your price range&lt;/a&gt; , looking in adjacent neighbourhoods is also an option you really need to do with a manual search using the map view on Centris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you&amp;rsquo ; re searching on your computer , you can draw a squiggly circle to define your search , rather than seeing everything from a neighbourhood . This is useful if you&amp;rsquo ; re interested in some parts of a municipality but not others , or if your search radius depends more on proximity to work , school or other important places than postal code . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Here are four more ways you can hack your home search : &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Find a walkable neighbourhood&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Living in a place where you can easily walk over to a coffee shop , grocery store or other services is not only a great way to reduce your carbon footprint , but also to improve your overall health . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Researchers have found that adults who live in &lt;a href= " https : **33;165117;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;walkable communities&lt;/a&gt; are slimmer than those who live in pedestrian-unfriendly areas , and have lower risk of diseases like diabetes . Walkable places also reduce feelings of isolation for those who live alone , as they are more likely to run into friends and neighbours if they live in a place where people regularly walk for pleasure or spend time at local haunts . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " https : **33;165152;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Centris offers two tools&lt;/a&gt; to find properties in walkable areas : &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The first is the &amp;ldquo ; lifestyle&amp;rdquo ; search filter , where you can select &amp;ldquo ; **29;165187;TOOLONG ; or &amp;ldquo ; **26;165218;TOOLONG ; as a must-have , or toggle options to find homes near the services that matter to you , such as grocery stores , schools , daycares , shopping or restaurants . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every listing also includes a little blue icon with a WalkScore ( &lt;a href= " https : //www.walkscore.com/ " target= " blank " rel= " noopener " **27;165246;TOOLONG ) rating . Click on it to find detailed information on nearby transit stops and services , bike infrastructure and how long it takes to get to the places that matter to you by car , bus , bike or on foot . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Find foreclosures&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; This one&amp;rsquo ; s a new feature launched just this month . With &lt;a href= " https : **33;165275;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;prices climbing in Montreal&lt;/a&gt; , investors and buyers on a budget can use this feature to try to find properties selling below market value to fix and flip or rent out . A note of caution : While these deals may seem sweet , there are fewer protections for the buyer when going this route , and many of these properties are in poor repair . It&amp;rsquo ; s a good idea to work with an experienced realtor , and set aside a fat savings cushion in case the home has more maintenance issues than you realized . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;See only newer ( or vintage ! ) homes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you&amp;rsquo ; re hoping to buy a property that has a modern aesthetic , or really don&amp;rsquo ; t want the headache and expense of having to renovate a property , you may want to limit your search to only newer homes . On the other hand , if you love the look and &lt;a href= " https : **33;165310;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;romance of a century home&lt;/a&gt; , you&amp;rsquo ; ll want to toggle the option to see only historic homes on Centris . You&amp;rsquo ; ll find both these options within the &amp;ldquo ; building features&amp;rdquo ; section of the search filters . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Get price and sales data for your specific area&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you&amp;rsquo ; ve been out of the market for a while , you may be experiencing some sticker shock when you see what homes are listed for these days . To get a sense of what a &amp;ldquo ; good&amp;rdquo ; price is for homes in your neighbourhood at current market rates , it can be helpful to look at the median price for the area ( think of it as the halfway point : half the homes sold for less and half sold for more ) . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers releases regular property market updates for Montreal , but when you break it down into local markets you can see that prices have climbed much more quickly in some areas than others . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You can find &lt;a href= " https : **33;165345;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;stats by region&lt;/a&gt; ( South Shore , West Island , or the Island of Montreal ) or municipality ( Beaconsfield , Hampstead , Lachine or Westmount , for example ) on Centris in the Tools menu . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There , you&amp;rsquo ; ll find a summary of what&amp;rsquo ; s happening in each local market , including the number of currently active listings , median price and average number of days to sell , as well as how those numbers are trending. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is useful both if you&amp;rsquo ; re &lt;a href= " https : **33;165380;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;thinking of selling your home&lt;/a&gt; ( you can get an idea of how hot your local market is , and how much prices have gone up or down in the past year . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;165415;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;165457;TOOLONG ... real estate market stays hot in February , posts 60th straight **25;165492;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;165519;TOOLONG ... your first home purchase ?

After suffering damage in a 1992 fire , the property was acquired by the city seven years later . The borough became its owner in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A recent audit by heritage experts found the building to be in poor shape .

Saguenay&lt;/a&gt; project . Though GNL Qu&amp;eacute ; bec wouldn&amp;rsquo ; t name the firm , Saguenay deputy mayor Michel Potvin identified it as Berkshire . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Potvin , who heads the local investment agency known as Promotion Saguenay , said Berkshire &amp;mdash ; which is run by Buffett , the legendary U.S. investor &amp;mdash ; would have invested about $4 billion . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We did not need this , especially at this stage of the project , &amp;rdquo ; Potvin told the Montreal Gazette in a telephone interview . &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re not going to find $4 billion tomorrow morning , and we sure aren&amp;rsquo ; t going to find it in the region .

It&amp;rsquo ; s too early to assess how the pullout will affect the project , she added . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; News of the Berkshire pullout comes with Canada&amp;rsquo ; s economy still reeling from weeks of solidarity protests over the proposed Coastal Gas Link pipeline in British Columbia .

It would also require the construction of a 750-kilometre pipeline to carry western Canadian gas , though GNL Qu&amp;eacute ; bec wouldn&amp;rsquo ; t be involved in its construction or its operation . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; About 15 private investors from Canada , the U.S. and Asia have so far committed to &amp;Eacute ; nergie Saguenay , Fortin said . They include former Bechtel Corp . general manager James Illich and U.S. venture capitalist Jim Breyer , an early investor in Facebook. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Environmental hearings on &amp;Eacute ; nergie Saguenay are scheduled to begin March 16. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A group of 40 Quebec economists &lt;a href= " https : **33;166391;TOOLONG ... expressed serious doubts&lt;/a&gt; last fall over &amp;Eacute ; nergie Saguenay&amp;rsquo ; s proposed economic and environmental benefits . Far from reducing pollution , they said , the project would increase emissions while replacing cleaner , conventional natural gas or renewable source electricity . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The economists also questioned the pledge that 6,000 jobs would be created directly or indirectly by the construction of the project and of 1,100 more once the processing plant is operational . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Environmental group Equiterre has said the project could potentially cancel out most of &lt;a href= " https : **33;166426;TOOLONG ... emissions reductions since 1990&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash ; in a single year . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Some doctors are also worried . &lt;a href= " https : **33;166461;TOOLONG ... an open letter published this week&lt;/a&gt; , 250 physicians and health professionals urged Premier Fran&amp;ccedil ; ois Legault not to forget the health of Quebecers while his government evaluates the project . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;With files from Canadian Press&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **29;166496;TOOLONG " target= " blank " rel= " noopener " **36;166527;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; Fr ? d ? ric TomescoThu , 05 Mar 2020 22:46:30 **45;166565;TOOLONG ...

February marked the 60th consecutive month of sales growth , the group said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The previous high for February dated back to 2002. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Last month&amp;rsquo ; s property transactions had a combined value of $2.21 billion , 39 per cent more than the $1.59 billion recorded in February 2019 . Sales on the island of Montreal accounted for just under half the total value . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sales growth was strongest in the suburbs . St-Jean-sur-Richelieu led the way with a 33-per-cent gain , followed by the South Shore with 30 per cent , Laval with 28 per cent and the North Shore with 23 per cent . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Property transactions on the island of Montreal climbed 17 per cent to 1,742. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Prices continued to climb , buoyed by dwindling supply . The median price of a single-family home across the greater Montreal area jumped 13 per cent to $360,000 , while the median price of a condominium rose 10 per cent to $275,000 . Plexes &amp;mdash ; defined as properties with two to five dwellings &amp;mdash ; sold for a median price of $597,750 , 13 per cent more than a year ago . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Montreal and its surroundings had 20,619 active residential listings last month , seven per cent less than in February 2019 . New listings dropped four per cent . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Active listings continue to decline , and this further tightening of the market in favour of sellers is leading to double-digit price growth in the tightest sectors , &amp;rdquo ; Julie Saucier , the group&amp;rsquo ; s president , said in a statement . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Montreal-area transactions are happening faster . It took 56 days on average to sell a single-family home last month , compared with 73 a year earlier . Condos required 61 days , down from 92 , while plexes sold in 65 days instead of 82. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Conditions are also heating up elsewhere in Quebec . Residential property sales in the province rose 28 per cent last month , QPAREB said , citing data from the Centris system .

Technological dreams are not enough . You need to be able to finance them &amp;mdash ; and to finance them , you need orders . It&amp;rsquo ; s a little bit like the failure of the Concorde . You had a technological success , a great plane , but financially it was more difficult . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Debuting commercially in 1976 , the sleek Franco-British Concorde &amp;mdash ; known for its delta-shaped wing and drooping nose &amp;mdash ; promised to revolutionize long-distance travel by slashing flying times . High operating costs meant that only 20 units of the jet were ever built before the Concorde was retired in 2003 , after a fatal crash near Paris . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Dassault CEO is in Canada this week on a three-day &amp;ldquo ; industrial mission&amp;rdquo ; as head of the French aerospace and defence industry association known as GIFAS .

" data-portal-copyright= " John Mahoney " **28;169328;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1735528 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; As the owner of Caf&amp;eacute ; Perko in Montreal&amp;rsquo ; s Villeray district , &amp;Eacute ; milie Lebel is more conscious than most people about the environmental toll of disposable coffee cups . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Back in 2018 , she was among a handful of independent business-owners who teamed up to try to tackle a global problem at a very local level : the enormous amount of waste generated by the grab-and-go coffee industry . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The caf&amp;eacute ; s joined forces to pioneer a consignment program called &lt;a href= " https : //www.latasse.org/ " target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;La Tasse&lt;/a&gt; . Customers who come in to grab a coffee without a mug of their own can get a bright blue reusable cup with a deposit of $5 . They can later return the cup and get their money back at any participating location . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; What started as a neighbourhood initiative involving 11 coffee shops in Villeray has now mushroomed into a network of 350 caf&amp;eacute ; s and restaurants across Quebec , from Abitibi to &amp;Icirc ; les-de-la-Madeleine . And it has high hopes of expanding or at least spreading its know-how across Canada . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We realized we all had common interests in terms of being more eco-responsible , but each one of us was having trouble doing it on our own , so we realized we had to put our energies together to really succeed and accomplish something , &amp;rdquo ; said Lebel. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The program is so popular with customers , they sometimes end up with a collection of four or five La Tasse cups at home . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; You can bring them all back at once and get $20 , $25 , &amp;rdquo ; said Lebel , who &lt;span style= " font-family : -apple-system , BlinkMacSystemFont , ' Segoe UI ' , Roboto , Oxygen-Sans , Ubuntu , Cantarell , ' Helvetica Neue ' , sans-serif ; " &gt; joked she sometimes ends up handing money back to customers , even when they 're ordering a large latt ? . But she 's OK with that since the idea is to keep the blue travel mugs circulating so they can be used over and over . &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Although La Tasse hasn&amp;rsquo ; t entirely eliminated the use of the cardboard disposable cups favoured by many indie caf&amp;eacute ; s in Montreal , it has contributed to a reduction . And given caffeine-loving Canadians toss out &lt;a href= " https : **33;169358;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;a staggering 1.6 to 2 billion single-use coffee cups&lt;/a&gt; per year , every bit helps . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The City of Montreal is in the process of developing a zero-waste strategy that could ban styrofoam takeout containers and disposable utensils in the near future . Quebec has announced a long-awaited &lt;a href= " https : **33;169393;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;returns plan for glass and plastic bottles&lt;/a&gt; , after years of the Soci&amp;eacute ; t&amp;eacute ; des alcools du Qu&amp;eacute ; bec resisting calls for a wine bottle consignment program . And the federal government is also developing policies to eliminate single-use plastics under the auspices of an international accord . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But rather than wait to be legislated into action , Montreal&amp;rsquo ; s independent purveyors are taking the lead in an industry that has not always been quick to adapt . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span style= " font-family : -apple-system , BlinkMacSystemFont , ' Segoe UI ' , Roboto , Oxygen-Sans , Ubuntu , Cantarell , ' Helvetica Neue ' , sans-serif ; " &gt;McDonald 's was called out in January over their&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href= " https : **33;169428;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt; refusal to fill reusable coffee cups&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style= " font-family : -apple-system , BlinkMacSystemFont , ' Segoe UI ' , Roboto , Oxygen-Sans , Ubuntu , Cantarell , ' Helvetica Neue ' , sans-serif ; " &gt; brought in by their patrons due to sanitary concerns . The multinational conglomerate promised to review its policies by the end of February , but a request for an update went unanswered by deadline time . &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tim Horton&amp;rsquo ; s fills travel mugs , but some locations have been singled out for using a disposable cup to measure out the coffee . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Starbucks , like Tim Horton&amp;rsquo ; s , already provides a discount to patrons who bring their own cups . In the U.S. , Starbucks and McDonald&amp;rsquo ; s are testing out a &lt;a href= " https : **33;169463;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt; " smart " reusable coffee cup embedded with tracking chips&lt;/a&gt; called the &amp;ldquo ; NextGen Cup Challenge . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But solutions to these big quandaries don&amp;rsquo ; t have to be complicated . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;169498;TOOLONG ... title= " ? milie Lebel , owner of Caf ?

Caf&amp;eacute ; Oui Mais Non on Jarry St. was using a high-quality , commercial brand of cup . But the price of the deposit was a steep $20 . Hoping to expand and perfect the program , they took the concept to their local &amp;Eacute ; coquartier organization in Villeray-St-Michel-Parc Extension , who shopped it around to local caf&amp;eacute ; s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;169563;TOOLONG ... title= " A new version of La Tasse is being designed after finding that the yellow lettering on this version had a tendency to rub off .

" data-portal-copyright= " John Mahoney " **28;169598;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1735529 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Together , the original participants worked with a local design firm to come up with a cup that would be less costly for customers , but of decent quality with a minimal ecological footprint . They are now working on a 2.0 version with engraved lettering , since the original yellow logo proved prone to rubbing off . They are hoping the new models might even be a made in Quebec . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Since La Tasse launched , Montreal&amp;rsquo ; s independent caf&amp;eacute ; s founded a new non-profit association in 2019 called &lt;a href= " https : //www.la-vague.ca/ " target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;La Vague , to work together&lt;/a&gt; and pool resources on a number of sustainable strategies . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This includes implementing that 25-cent charge on single-use coffee cups to help build awareness among customers about waste . The funds collected are remitted to the collective to support new programs and research . They are now investigating a deposit system for utensils and a &amp;ldquo ; lunchbox&amp;rdquo ; that can be recirculated to replace takeout containers and doggie bags . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We believe that in the face of the climate emergency , everyone has to do their part and it&amp;rsquo ; s difficult for an owner to know what to do by themselves and do it alone&amp;hellip ; It&amp;rsquo ; s really by getting together that we can find the resources to adopt measures that are adequate , concrete and effective , &amp;rdquo ; said Lebel , who is the president of La Vague . &amp;ldquo ; And on a personal level , I sincerely believe that if the small actors can come together and develop programs like La Tasse , it can put pressure on the big players . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **27;169628;TOOLONG " **34;169657;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;169693;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;169735;TOOLONG ...

If it&amp;rsquo ; s your first time buying a property you won&amp;rsquo ; t live in , you should know that buying profitable investment property isn&amp;rsquo ; t as easy as it looks . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Here are six tips to help you do your due diligence before putting an offer on an investment property : &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;1 . Determine your investment objectives&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Are you looking for an investment that will generate regular income for you on a monthly basis ? Or are you OK with a property breaking even if you believe you can sell it at a profit five or 10 years from now ? Or maybe you&amp;rsquo ; re just looking for a mortgage helper and you don&amp;rsquo ; t need the rental income to fully cover all the property&amp;rsquo ; s expenses ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whatever your objective , it&amp;rsquo ; s best to clearly define what you&amp;rsquo ; re looking to get out of your investment and when so you don&amp;rsquo ; t end up saddled with a property that isn&amp;rsquo ; t giving you the payoff you want . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;2 . Do the math before you look&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most buyers know their dream home when they see it . If you&amp;rsquo ; re mainly buying for investment , however , the most important thing to see is that the numbers are in your favour . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Create a spreadsheet to calculate income vs. expenses for the properties that interest you , and don&amp;rsquo ; t see anything that doesn&amp;rsquo ; t deliver the return you&amp;rsquo ; re looking for . Remember to factor in maintenance costs as well as a cushion in case of late payment or a delay in finding a new tenant . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you do put in an offer , have your broker do a market analysis and factor in the revenue potential to come up with a fair price . Don&amp;rsquo ; t assume the seller will take a lowball offer even if the property doesn&amp;rsquo ; t break even at the current price . The seller&amp;rsquo ; s willingness to negotiate will vary depending on &lt;a href= " https : **33;170074;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;local market dynamics&lt;/a&gt; and their personal situation . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to Royal LePage realtor Sean Broady , Montreal is a seller&amp;rsquo ; s market right now , but savvy buyers may have more luck finding profitable buildings &amp;mdash ; and better luck negotiating &amp;mdash ; in outlying areas . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; In N.D.G. , if you&amp;rsquo ; re trying to buy a plex , they&amp;rsquo ; re selling for very good prices for sellers . Most are cash-flow negative , but it&amp;rsquo ; s a hot market and they&amp;rsquo ; re selling quickly , whereas a Valleyfield triplex may have more room to negotiate , &amp;rdquo ; Broady said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;3 . Do n't skip the inspection ! &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; The lowest-priced building isn&amp;rsquo ; t always the best deal . According to Broady , the big-ticket items are the most important to pay attention to , including the age of the heating system , windows and roof . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While newer buildings may cost more , they may have fewer maintenance headaches . In addition to your inspection report , you may also want to ask any current tenants if there are outstanding maintenance issues they are aware of . You will also need to ensure the building complies with all safety , sanitation , maintenance and zoning requirements . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you have made &lt;a href= " https : **33;170109;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;an offer subject to inspection&lt;/a&gt; and you discover major defects or maintenance issues , the ball&amp;rsquo ; s in your court : Depending on what you discover , you can try to negotiate an adjustment to the price , ask the seller to make necessary repairs or walk away from the deal . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;4 . Vet the tenants&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; If there are existing tenants , request copies of the lease agreements to verify key terms of the lease , including how long they have been there , when the lease is up , how much they pay in rent , and determine who is responsible for heating and electricity costs and things like snow removal . You can also check with the provincial R&amp;eacute ; gie du Logement and the Court of Quebec to check if there are any complaints on file against the tenants for nonpayment of rent . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While a tenanted building is easier to secure financing for and offers some peace of mind for the buyer , the downside is that longtime tenants may be paying below-market rent . Conversely , a vacant or owner-occupied building can be more easily &lt;a href= " https : **33;170144;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;upgraded and re-listed&lt;/a&gt; at a higher monthly rate . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;5 . Read up on renters ' rights&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tenant protection laws are strict in Quebec . You can&amp;rsquo ; t jack up the rent for no reason or evict a tenant &amp;mdash ; even a bad tenant &amp;mdash ; without effort ( and sometimes , not at all ) . It&amp;rsquo ; s a good idea to spend a bit of time familiarizing yourself with the law so you know your responsibilities as a landlord as well as &lt;a href= " https : **33;170179;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;what your tenants are and are not entitled to&lt;/a&gt; . A good place to start is &amp;Eacute ; ducaloi&amp;rsquo ; s &lt;a href= " https : **33;170214;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;plain-language legal resources&lt;/a&gt; for landlord and tenants , as well as the R&amp;eacute ; gie du Logement&amp;rsquo ; s &lt;a href= " https : **33;170249;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;guide for new landlords&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The R&amp;eacute ; gie recommends new landlords should check if the former owners sent out notices of rent increase , or received a notice of non-renewal of lease , or any other recent notices , for example to sublet a unit or assign a lease . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;6 . Do n't overlook investing in a single-family home or condo&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Plexes are far from the only type of property you can rent out , Broady noted . Single-family home or condo rentals mean you have fewer tenants to deal with , so you are more likely to have fewer maintenance calls . On the other hand , in a plex , if one unit is vacant you&amp;rsquo ; ll still have income from the other suites to offset the building&amp;rsquo ; s expenses . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The single-family home rental market is very active , &amp;rdquo ; Broady said . &amp;ldquo ; There are shortages of these rentals &lt;a href= " https : **33;170284;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;not only on the Island but also Off-Island&lt;/a&gt; . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;170319;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;170361;TOOLONG ... for a chalet ?

Pincourt , St-Lazare , Hudson , Rigaud , S.-Zotique , and Vaudreuil-Dorion ) , plex prices increased by only 20 per cent over the same period , to $332,500 from a median price of $270,000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But here&amp;rsquo ; s the thing : the rise in property values in the city means it&amp;rsquo ; s harder for landlords to find a property with rents that cover the monthly expenses . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Because rent increases are strictly controlled by the R&amp;eacute ; gie du Logement , longtime tenants are now paying rents well below market rates . In some cases , the rents aren&amp;rsquo ; t high enough to cover the landlord&amp;rsquo ; s mortgage , tax and maintenance expenses . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Off-Island , it&amp;rsquo ; s another story . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Royal LePage broker Sean Broady stated while it is still possible to find a cash-flow positive plex downtown , these gems are much easier to come by Off-Island. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Broady recently did a pulsecheck of the plex market here , and found that out of 10 randomly picked plex listings on the market in Vaudreuil-Soulanges , &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them were cash-flow positive &amp;mdash ; with earnings outstripping expenses by as much as $400 per month in some cases . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I think for investors and for people who have the flexibility to live Off-Island , I think these revenue properties are a superb investment , &amp;rdquo ; Broady said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One property he found in St-Zotique , for example , was built in 2013 and was cash-flow positive by about $3,000 per year . Being more recently built , it would likely have fewer maintenance headaches than a 1930s-era plex in a hot neighbourhood like NDG &amp;mdash ; and at a much lower purchase price too , he said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Broady said most of the plex listings he analyzed had tenants in place , many of them long-term tenants , which could be reassuring for landlords worried about finding tenants . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I think the Off-Island is a bit of a hidden gem , &amp;rdquo ; he said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;170695;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;170737;TOOLONG ...

They jumped 8.5 per cent in the 12-month period ended Jan. 31 amid a dearth of inventory , according to the real estate agency&amp;rsquo ; s data . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Luxury condominium prices are also poised to rise , with Royal LePage predicting a five-per-cent gain in the wake of last year&amp;rsquo ; s 8.3-per-cent advance . Median prices for luxury condos on the island have now surpassed $1.4 million , the data show . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re off to a very strong start this year , and unless there is some sort of financial crisis , 2020 is going to be even better than 2019 , &amp;rdquo ; Marie-Yvonne Paint , luxury real estate agent at Royal LePage , told the Montreal Gazette in an interview . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; With the firm&amp;rsquo ; s luxury house sales up 35 per cent year to date and million-dollar condos up 58 per cent , &amp;ldquo ; we&amp;rsquo ; ll likely hit records if things continue like this , &amp;rdquo ; Paint added . &amp;ldquo ; Up to $2.5 million , the market is doing very well . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Royal LePage defines luxury homes as those that sell for at least $1.32 million . It puts the threshold for luxury condos at $1.05 million . &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Montreal&amp;rsquo ; s expected performance should again allow it to figure among the best performing Canadian markets in 2020 , Royal LePage said . Supply is being held back by a lack of confidence among sellers that they will find a suitable property after they sell their current dwelling . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Once mostly restricted to such tony areas as Westmount , Outremont and the Town of Mount-Royal , Montreal&amp;rsquo ; s luxury &lt;a href= " https : **33;171191;TOOLONG ... real estate&lt;/a&gt; market has now expanded to neighbourhoods like Griffintown and the Plateau Mont-Royal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; People are prepared to pay a premium to be on the island and minimize travel times , &amp;rdquo ; Paint said . &amp;ldquo ; There&amp;rsquo ; s been a big wave of buying in Montreal , which has benefited developers . This is why all those condo towers have gone up in the last few years . And they&amp;rsquo ; re all sold out , which is excellent for the city of Montreal . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Paint highlighted a single-family house in Villeray that she&amp;rsquo ; s marketing , which she said will soon sell for more than $2 million . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; A $2-million property in Villeray &amp;mdash ; who could have imagined that a few years ago , &amp;rdquo ; she asked . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Her colleague , sales director Samuel Demers , cited the case of a semi-detached property in **26;171226;TOOLONG ; ce that recently sold for $1.8 million . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Montreal&amp;rsquo ; s core has become so expensive that people are being forced to go to the outskirts , and this is also true for the luxury market , &amp;rdquo ; Demers said . &amp;ldquo ; People who could have afforded a house in Westmount five years ago now have to look westward to get as much value for their buck . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While inventory is plentiful on the luxury condo side , demand still exists . A $5.9-million apartment at Sherbrooke St.&amp;rsquo ; s Sir George Simpson building recently sold in the space of one week , according to Paint . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Luxury condos now sell for about $1,200 to $1,500 per square foot , Paint said .

" It is the most far-reaching review of the wireless industry since 2007 , when the federal government decided to make it easier for new players to enter the mobile market , " Pierre Karl P ? ladeau writes . " data-portal-copyright= " Adrian Wyld " **28;171545;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1728710 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; On Tuesday , the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) opened a hearing on mobile wireless services . It is the most far-reaching review of the wireless industry since 2007 , when the federal government decided to make it easier for new players to enter the mobile market . Whatever one may think of the Harper government of the time , it can not be denied that the measures to promote competition in wireless services introduced by the late Jim Prentice , then-minister of Industry and subsequently premier of Alberta , disrupted the mobile cartel , " The Big 3 , " controlled by Bell , Telus and Rogers . In Quebec , they paved the way for real competition from Qu&amp;eacute ; becor and Vid&amp;eacute ; otron. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At the time , the federal government listened to our arguments and made the wise decision to set aside spectrum for new market entrants . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In Quebec , the impact has been indisputable and the resulting competition has delivered multiple benefits . Vid&amp;eacute ; otron began rolling out its own network in 2008 , which shook up the market at the time and continues to help shape the wireless landscape in Quebec to this day . Vid&amp;eacute ; otron invested more than $2 billion in its network and created thousands of good jobs that benefited Quebec&amp;rsquo ; s economy . Since it entered the market , prices for mobile plans have dropped more sharply in Quebec than anywhere else in Canada . In 10 years , Vid&amp;eacute ; otron has risen to the top of several rankings of network quality and customer service . This is a concrete example of what facilities-based competition can do . Not to mention the billions of dollars the federal government has collected in the spectrum auctions . There is every reason for the CRTC to continue supporting the facilities-based competitive model . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Some try to deny the evidence , but the Competition Bureau of Canada has found that the presence of a strong fourth player such as Vid&amp;eacute ; otron in a market has a direct effect on prices . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Bell has always opposed any form of competition that challenges its dominance . One need only look at the pattern of recurring anti-competitive behaviour by Bell . Here are a few examples : In December , the CRTC had to order Bell to give Vid&amp;eacute ; otron access to its network in Abitibi-T&amp;eacute ; miscamingue , a region where prices for telecommunications services are much higher than the Quebec average because of Bell&amp;rsquo ; s monopoly . The CRTC has ruled that Bell TV is giving its RDS channel an undue advantage , at the expense of its competitor TVA Sports . &lt;a href= " https : **33;171575;TOOLONG ... Quebec Court of Appeal ordered Bell to pay Quebecor $141 million for failing to prevent piracy of its satellite signals&lt;/a&gt; . In another vein , &lt;a href= " https : **33;171610;TOOLONG ... Media 's president had to be fired for trying to control CTV 's news coverage&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; These are not theories or rhetoric , but facts that have been ascertained by the courts or regulatory authorities . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In light of all of these considerations , it is our hope that the CRTC will maintain the policy of promoting facilities-based competition in the mobile market that the government adopted more than 10 years ago . That approach has been shown to deliver significant benefits for the public as a whole . Quebecor will always support fair and healthy competition . At the end of the day , it&amp;rsquo ; s good for everyone . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Pierre Karl P ? ladeau is president and CEO of Qu ? becor , which owns Vid ? otron. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; Pierre Karl P ? ladeau , Special to Montreal GazetteSat , 22 Feb 2020 11:00:13 **45;171645;TOOLONG ... estate : Not your first home purchase ?

While most homeowners have profited from the rise in property values , not everyone who owns a home walks away with more money than when they first bought . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Maybe your equity was halved because of divorce . Maybe you pulled out money from the equity in your home to pay off debts or finance other projects &amp;mdash ; and now need to move . Maybe your home &lt;a href= " https : **31;171826;TOOLONG " target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;lost value because of floods&lt;/a&gt; , damage caused by &lt;a href= " https : **33;171859;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;unstable soil&lt;/a&gt; or some other disaster beyond your control . Or maybe you lost your job and had to sell your home because you could no longer afford the mortgage payments . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whatever the reason , you&amp;rsquo ; ve probably discovered something frustrating : most programs designed to make &lt;a href= " https : **33;171894;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;home ownership&lt;/a&gt; more affordable are geared to first-time buyers . If you&amp;rsquo ; ve bought property before , even if you are renting now because life took a bad turn , you don&amp;rsquo ; t qualify for the same help as someone buying their first home . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But what you might not know is that you may in fact qualify as a &amp;ldquo ; first-time&amp;rdquo ; buyer , even if this is far from your first real-estate rodeo . Read the fine print , and it turns out that many of the major government-funded home affordability initiatives include some exceptions to the &amp;ldquo ; first-timer&amp;rdquo ; rule . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;CMHC First-Time Home Buyer Incentive&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; It says it right there in the title that this program , introduced last fall , is for first-time buyers only . What you may not know , however , is that CMHC&amp;rsquo ; s definition of &amp;ldquo ; first-timer&amp;rdquo ; is not the same as yours and mine . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It turns out that &lt;a href= " https : **33;171929;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;the program makes an exception&lt;/a&gt; for people who are divorced or leaving a live-in partner . You also qualify if it has been four years since you lived in a home that you or your current partner owned . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; On the other hand , you could also be a first-time buyer who doesn&amp;rsquo ; t qualify . If your total annual qualifying income is greater than $120,000 or if you&amp;rsquo ; re buying with a partner who has owned property before , for example , you may be turned down for the program . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The program offers buyers an interest-free loan valued between five and 10 per cent of the purchase price , which must be repaid after 25 years or when the property is sold ( whichever is first ) , which lowers the buyer&amp;rsquo ; s monthly payment .

The program defines a first-time buyer as anyone who has not occupied a home they owned or that a current spouse or common-law partners owned within the previous four years . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 2019 , the definition was expanded to also include &lt;a href= " https : **33;172266;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;people who are divorced or leaving a common-law partnership&lt;/a&gt; . You may also qualify if you are a person with a disability or helping a related person with a disability purchase a home . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One key note about this program : you must repay the money you withdraw from your RRSPs within 15 years .

The performance trails the 11.9-per-cent increase in the Caisse&amp;rsquo ; s own benchmark index , and the 14-per-cent return for Canadian defined benefit pension plans &lt;a href= " http : **34;172655;TOOLONG ... by RBC&lt;/a&gt; Financial Group . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This marks the last full year under longtime chief executive officer Michael Sabia , who left this year to become head of the University of Toronto&amp;rsquo ; s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy . Former banker Charles Emond , who joined the Caisse a year ago , &lt;a href= " https : **33;172691;TOOLONG ... Sabia&lt;/a&gt; at the helm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; For us , the portfolio is delivering what we wanted , &amp;rdquo ; Emond told reporters at a press conference in Montreal Thursday , pointing out that Caisse depositors require average annual returns of about 6 per cent . &amp;ldquo ; What we look for is a stable performance from year to year . We want to be less vulnerable to the ups and downs of the markets . We&amp;rsquo ; re not trying to follow the wave , &amp;rdquo ; he said , calling stock markets &amp;ldquo ; euphoric . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Under Sabia , the Caisse pivoted toward a strategy that focuses on asset selection and diversification in a bid to better withstand market downturns . As part of this push , the Caisse has been boosting its exposure to global markets as well as credit and real-asset investments such as infrastructure . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Public equities lifted the Caisse&amp;rsquo ; s 2019 performance , posting a 17.2-per-cent increase &amp;mdash ; and producing $17.7 billion of investment income &amp;mdash ; as global stock markets soared . The Caisse&amp;rsquo ; s Canadian equity holdings advanced 20.5 per cent , while its &amp;ldquo ; global quality&amp;rdquo ; portfolio of large-capitalization stocks gained 18.2 per cent . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Real estate posted a negative return of 2.7 per cent , generating an investment loss of $1.1 billion . Falling valuations for Canadian shopping centres and residential real estate in New York &amp;mdash ; due in part to rent control increases in the U.S. financial hub &amp;mdash ; contributed to the underperformance , the Caisse said . It owns 25 malls across Canada . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over five years , real estate has returned 7.2 per cent , short of the Caisse&amp;rsquo ; s 8.8-per-cent benchmark . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Infrastructure advanced 7.1 per cent last year , trailing the 17.7-per-cent return of the Caisse&amp;rsquo ; s own benchmark , which includes more than 200 securities of publicly traded companies . The Caisse says its infrastructure portfolio , which includes about 40 assets , targets lower risks and a more stable long-term performance . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over five years , the Caisse said it generated overall net investment results of $18.6 billion for an annualized return of 4.3 per cent . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Emond , who took over Feb. 1 , warned depositors Thursday to brace for rockier times in the years ahead . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We expect the next decade to be more challenging than the past one , during which all investors benefited from the longest bull market in history , &amp;rdquo ; he said in a statement . &amp;ldquo ; In the context of a growing gap between real economic performance and market performance , and multiple indicators prompting us to be cautious , it will be important for our strategy to continue evolving while we manage responsibly and with agility . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Emond declined to say whether the Caisse plans to keep its stake in Bombardier Inc. now that the Montreal-based manufacturer &lt;a href= " https : **33;172726;TOOLONG ... agreed to sell its train unit to France 's Alstom SA&lt;/a&gt; and focus exclusively on business aircraft . Private jets are traditionally much more cyclical than trains , which may result in a more volatile stock performance &amp;mdash ; exactly the opposite of what the Caisse is aiming for . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Once the deal closes , the Caisse will own about 18 per cent of Alstom &amp;mdash ; an investment that could be worth up to $4 billion . By contrast , its stake in Bombardier is now worth about $200 million , &amp;ldquo ; which is fairly small overall , &amp;rdquo ; Emond told reporters . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; People lose sight of the fact that following this transaction , the business jet enterprise still ranks Bombardier as one of the top five industrial groups in Canada , &amp;rdquo ; the Caisse CEO said . &amp;ldquo ; This is no small company . It&amp;rsquo ; s a world leader . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Bombardier has &amp;ldquo ; a strong product&amp;rdquo ; with the Global 7500 jet , &amp;ldquo ; and they find themselves in a position to compete and rebound , &amp;rdquo ; Emond added . &amp;ldquo ; Our conviction has been historically more on the rail side for several reasons , such as long-term trends and urbanization . From that perspective , we&amp;rsquo ; re focused on our investment in Alstom , but I&amp;rsquo ; m sure Bombardier&amp;rsquo ; s management team find themselves , at least on a relative basis , in a better position than before . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **29;172761;TOOLONG " **36;172792;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;172830;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;172872;TOOLONG ... aims to sell one-third of Canadian malls as e-commerce **26;172907;TOOLONG &lt;/ul&gt; Fr ? d ? ric TomescoThu , 20 Feb 2020 19:57:09 **45;172935;TOOLONG ...

Proceeds will go toward paying down the company&amp;rsquo ; s $9.3 billion of long-term debt , Bombardier said . The partners are aiming to close the deal in the first half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We looked at many options , but clearly there was a need for consolidation on the train side , &amp;rdquo ; Alain Bellemare said Tuesday at a Barclays investor conference in Miami . &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; ve tried that on our own since I joined the business in 2015 . We had discussions with many players in the industry , but we just couldn&amp;rsquo ; t do it given our balance sheet situation . So if you&amp;rsquo ; re not the consolidator , and there&amp;rsquo ; s a need for consolidation , maybe you then look at other options &amp;mdash ; and the other option was to sell . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Alstom and Bombardier have both tried to gain scale in recent years to fend off increased competition from Chinese state-owned railcar maker CRRC &amp;mdash ; itself the result of a 2015 merger . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 2017 , &lt;a href= " http : **34;173625;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Bombardier and its French rival held separate combination talks with Siemens AG&lt;/a&gt; of Germany . &lt;a href= " http : **34;173661;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Siemens eventually chose to merge with Alstom&lt;/a&gt; , but the European Commission blocked the transaction last year because it would have harmed competition . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The failed Siemens deal will serve Alstom well as it aims to convince Brussels of giving the go-ahead , Bellemare insists . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We feel confident about the antitrust approval process , &amp;rdquo ; he said . &amp;ldquo ; Alstom did great work already coming up with potential remedies . They&amp;rsquo ; ve learned a lot through their experience&amp;rdquo ; in the Siemens deal , he said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Alstom and Bombardier Transportation &amp;ldquo ; are very complementary businesses , &amp;rdquo ; the CEO added . &amp;ldquo ; There were significant overlaps on high-speed trains and signalling in the failed Siemens-Alstom merger , but we don&amp;rsquo ; t have any of that here , or very little . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The sale of Bombardier Transportation caps a five-year drive by Bellemare to shrink a once sprawling industrial icon by more than half and convert it into a mostly North American manufacturer with a single line of business . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As a pure-play maker of private jets , Bombardier will have revenue of about US$7 billion , 18,000 employees and plants in Canada , Mexico and the U.S. The projected workforce includes about 10,000 people in Quebec . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At $14.4 billion , Bombardier&amp;rsquo ; s business-jet backlog represents two years of sales . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; About 4,800 Bombardier business jets are currently in operation globally . This gives the company ample opportunity to sell more spare parts and boost aftermarket revenue , chief financial officer John Di Bert said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization in aviation amounted to about 7 per cent of sales last year , and Bombardier can boost that margin beyond 10 per cent , Bellemare said . &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We have runway for margin expansion , &amp;rdquo ; he said . &amp;ldquo ; Today we&amp;rsquo ; re in mid-single digits .

Any payment will go toward reducing capital expenditures , he said without providing specific figures . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Global air transport regulators &lt;a href= " http : **34;174194;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;ordered the grounding of all 737 Max jets&lt;/a&gt; in March after a fatal crash in Ethiopia , which followed another one in Indonesia five months earlier . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Air Canada now expects the jet to gradually return to service late in the third quarter , executives said Tuesday . Boeing said last month the Max probably wouldn&amp;rsquo ; t be approved to fly again before mid-2020 , and predicted the cost of compensating airlines would surpass $8 billion . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re quite confident that the Boeing 737 Max will fly again , and we believe customers will regain confidence in this aircraft , &amp;rdquo ; chief executive officer Calin Rovinescu told analysts . &amp;ldquo ; Once the aircraft is ruled safe by the regulators , by Boeing , and by our own internal safety and pilot groups , we will be fully dedicated to fully returning it safely to service . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Canada&amp;rsquo ; s biggest carrier was operating 24 737 Max aircraft at the time of the grounding , having signed a firm order for 61 jets in 2013 with a list value of about US$6.5 billion . The grounding deprived Air Canada of about one-quarter of its narrow-body fleet for most of last year . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Pilots at Air Canada have been training on 737 Max simulators for the past year , which should reduce the time required to deploy the jets once regulators have lifted the ban , Rovinescu said . The carrier owns two simulators , and has partial access to another device . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re relatively in good shape&amp;rdquo ; for the return to service , the CEO said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Air Canada on Tuesday reported earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization of $665 million , a seven-per-cent increase from the year-ago period . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It also introduced profit targets for 2020 that fell short of consensus estimates . First-quarter EBITDA will drop from the same period a year ago to about $383 million due to the absence of the 737 Max and the suspension of China and Toronto-Hong Kong operations , Air Canada said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For the full year , Air Canada projects a &amp;ldquo ; small increase&amp;rdquo ; in EBITDA from last year&amp;rsquo ; s $3.64 billion , while the average analyst estimate was calling for 2020 EBITDA of about $4 billion . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Shares of the company dropped 2.6 per cent to $45 in Tuesday trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Last month , Air Canada suspended service to mainland China and on the Toronto-Hong Kong route until the end of March following &lt;a href= " http : **34;174230;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;the coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Air Canada now assumes its mainland China and Hong Kong service will fully recover by the third quarter . Combined , both regions account for about nine per cent of the airline&amp;rsquo ; s annual available seat-miles , Rousseau said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Executives also stressed Air Canada is working to address the issues that have affected its new reservation system . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We regret some of the inconvenience that it may have caused , but by and large , given the size of our airline and the complexity of our system , we&amp;rsquo ; re confident we&amp;rsquo ; re going to be able to get through this relatively quickly , &amp;rdquo ; chief commercial officer Lucie Guillemette said on the call . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The new system , which was rolled out in November , &amp;ldquo ; is very stable now , &amp;rdquo ; Guillemette said . &amp;ldquo ; There are some areas where we&amp;rsquo ; re looking to bring in some significant improvements quickly .

Proceeds will go toward paying down the Montreal-based company&amp;rsquo ; s $9.3 billion of long-term debt , Bombardier said . Closing is expected to take place in the first half of 2021 , the companies said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The deal will see the Caisse de d&amp;eacute ; p&amp;ocirc ; t et placement du Qu&amp;eacute ; bec become Alstom&amp;rsquo ; s biggest shareholder by converting its minority Bombardier Transportation holding into shares of the acquirer and making an additional investment of 700 million euros ( $1 billion ) . As a result , the Caisse will own about 18 per cent of Alstom and control two board seats . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It is a transformational deal for Bombardier , &amp;rdquo ; chief executive officer Alain Bellemare said Monday on a conference call with financial analysts . &amp;ldquo ; It marks the end of our turnaround , and the beginning of a new and bright chapter for the company . It really changes the game for us . It positions Bombardier to accelerate our deleveraging. &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The transaction &amp;mdash ; the biggest divestiture in Bombardier history &amp;mdash ; caps a dizzying drive by Bellemare to shrink a once-sprawling Quebec industrial icon . In 2014 , the last full year before he became CEO , Bombardier had 73,800 employees and sales of US$20.1 billion . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the last two years alone , &lt;a href= " https : **33;174517;TOOLONG ... handed control of the C Series jet to Airbus SE&lt;/a&gt; , sold &lt;a href= " https : **33;174552;TOOLONG ... Downsview facility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href= " https : **33;174587;TOOLONG ... turboprop business&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href= " https : **33;174622;TOOLONG ... to sell the CRJ regional-jet program to Japan 's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries&lt;/a&gt; . In November , he struck a deal to &lt;a href= " https : **33;174657;TOOLONG ... the aerostructures business to Spirit AeroSystems for US$591 million&lt;/a&gt; . The last two transactions are expected to close by June 30. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As a pure-play maker of business jets , Bombardier will have annual revenue of about US$7 billion and 18,000 employees . The company had US$15.8 billion of revenue last year with a workforce of 60,400. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;174692;TOOLONG ... title= " An Exo commuter train manufactured by Bombardier heads east through the Woodland station in Beaconsfield .

" data-portal-copyright= " John Mahoney " **28;174727;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1724855 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Bombardier&amp;rsquo ; s biggest and priciest business jet , the Global 7500 , is almost sold out through 2022 , and the company has started taking orders for 2023 , chief financial officer John Di Bert said in the call . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We really like our business-aircraft business , &amp;rdquo ; Bellemare said . &amp;ldquo ; We have a very solid base , and we see a significant opportunity for growth and margin expansion . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That opportunity comes with sizeable risks . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Yes , the transaction solves a lot of issues , but business jets are highly cyclical , &amp;rdquo ; Chris Murray , an AltaCorp Capital analyst in Toronto , said in a telephone interview . &amp;ldquo ; You no longer have the buffer that rail provided . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Total proceeds of the sale , after the deduction of debt-like items and liabilities such as pension obligations , are expected to be about $6.4 billion , Bombardier said Monday . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After deducting the Caisse&amp;rsquo ; s equity position , which is worth as much as $2.3 billion , Bombardier would receive net proceeds of up to $4.5 billion , including $550 million of Alstom shares that will be &amp;ldquo ; monetizable&amp;rdquo ; after a three-month lock-up period following closing . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Alstom , like Bombardier , is one of the world&amp;rsquo ; s biggest makers of rail equipment . It had a backlog of 40 billion euros as of March 2019 , and annual sales of 8.1 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Both companies have tried to get bigger in recent years to fend off increased competition from Chinese railcar maker CRRC . In 2017 , Alstom and Bombardier held separate talks with Germany&amp;rsquo ; s Siemens AG about combining their train operations . Siemens eventually chose to merge with Alstom , but European competition authorities rejected the deal a year ago . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This time around , Bellemare seems confident the transaction with Alstom will win antitrust approval . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; There&amp;rsquo ; s a great fit between Alstom and BT , &amp;rdquo ; Bellemare said on the call . &amp;ldquo ; There&amp;rsquo ; s very minimal overlap . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Alstom&amp;rsquo ; s acquisition of Bombardier Transportation comes with a commitment to expand its presence in Quebec and develop its activities in the Americas . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Once the deal closes , Alstom&amp;rsquo ; s head of the Americas will be based in Montreal , which will serve as the headquarters for the &amp;ldquo ; activities developed in the Americas . &amp;rdquo ; All support functions for the Americas , such as human resources , legal and accounting services , will also be based in the province . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; All told , Alstom&amp;rsquo ; s Quebec-based executives will oversee more than 13,000 employees across the Americas . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In a statement that praised Alstom &amp;ldquo ; for its capacity to manage and execute projects , &amp;rdquo ; Caisse CEO Charles Emond said Monday the deal &amp;ldquo ; strengthens the company&amp;rsquo ; s global leadership in sustainable mobility . It&amp;rsquo ; s an investment in a company that is well positioned to harness the growth of a promising sector , which is perfectly aligned with our strategy and will produce attractive returns for our depositors over the long term . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Alstom already has ties to the Caisse : it&amp;rsquo ; s building the railcars for the pension fund manager&amp;rsquo ; s R&amp;eacute ; seau express m&amp;eacute ; tropolitain , having beaten out Bombardier for the order in 2018. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Quebec Premier Fran&amp;ccedil ; ois Legault &lt;a href= " http : **34;174757;TOOLONG ... target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;welcomed the deal&lt;/a&gt; , highlighting the role played by the Caisse in securing jobs for the province . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It is certain that I would have liked if things had turned out differently for Bombardier , because this company has occupied and will continue to occupy an important place in the Quebec economy , &amp;rdquo ; Legault said in a statement . &amp;ldquo ; &lt;span title= " " &gt;But with the Caisse as the first shareholder of the new Alstom , we can be reassured : Quebec 's interests will always be on the company 's agenda . " &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Across the ocean , French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire &lt;a href= " https : **33;174793;TOOLONG ... " delight " &lt;/a&gt; in a tweet at seeing Alstom play &amp;ldquo ; a leading role in strengthening the European rail industry . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Reaction on the labour front was lukewarm , with Quebec&amp;rsquo ; s CSN union welcoming the end of &amp;ldquo ; several months of uncertainty&amp;rdquo ; while urging Alstom to quickly &amp;ldquo ; clarify&amp;rdquo ; its intentions with regard to Bombardier&amp;rsquo ; s La Pocati&amp;egrave ; re plant . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Bombardier Transportation had revenue of US$8.3 billion last year , and the company expects the figure will climb to US$9.5 billion in 2020 . It has $35.8 billion of future contracts in its backlog and about 36,050 employees . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The unit has been beset by software and quality issues on a series of so-called &amp;ldquo ; legacy&amp;rdquo ; contracts in Europe and the U.S. over several years , forcing Bombardier to incur additional costs and pay late-delivery penalties . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Alstom has identified about 400 million euros of annual cost savings it can achieve after four to five years , according to a &lt;a href= " https : **33;174828;TOOLONG ... presentation&lt;/a&gt; . So-called &amp;ldquo ; synergies&amp;rdquo ; would come from areas such as procurement , better design and &amp;ldquo ; footprint optimization&amp;rdquo ; &amp;mdash ; in other words , likely plant closures . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; With the sale , Bombardier is closing the book on a trainmaking adventure that began with the 1970 acquisition of Austrian scooter and tramway maker Lohnerwerke and its engine-making unit , Rotax. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The oil crisis of 1973 , which forced Bombardier to halve snowmobile output , soon thrust the need to diversify to the forefront . At the time , snowmobiles accounted for 90 per cent of Bombardier&amp;rsquo ; s revenue . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A year later , Bombardier had its breakthrough win : a landmark contract to build 423 subway cars for the entity now known as the Soci&amp;eacute ; t&amp;eacute ; de transport de Montr&amp;eacute ; al . Several orders followed , including a marquee deal with New York&amp;rsquo ; s Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1982. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Bombardier Transportation took on a truly global dimension with the 2001 acquisition of **25;174863;TOOLONG ; s Adtranz rail unit , later moving its headquarters to Berlin . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While Bombardier gained valuable scale and technology , analysts said the deal created a series of organizational problems that took years to resolve . At the time of the deal , Adtranz was twice the size of Bombardier and had 22,000 employees . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **29;174890;TOOLONG " **36;174921;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;174959;TOOLONG ... &lt;ul class= " relatedlinks " &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;175001;TOOLONG ... went wrong at Bombardier ? **31;175036;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;175069;TOOLONG ... ride : Bombardier wants to breathe life into **28;175104;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;175134;TOOLONG ...

It&amp;rsquo ; s turning into a reckoning . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s about the choices Quebec made in the past , when asbestos was our white gold , &amp;rdquo ; F&amp;eacute ; lix Lapan of the Union des travailleuses et travailleurs accident&amp;eacute ; s ou malades told the commission . &amp;ldquo ; We put it everywhere , everywhere . Now we are stuck with it in our buildings today . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We have to keep that in our heads in the decisions we are making today about developing the mining residues . The bad choices of the past , it&amp;rsquo ; s the workers , the population , the sick people who are paying for that . We have to be careful we don&amp;rsquo ; t make the same choices today . We have to look at the history and if we want the numbers ( of dead and dying ) to come down with time , we have to make good decisions today . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Asbestos was mined between 1870 and 2012 at more than 20 different sites in the Estrie and Chaudi&amp;egrave ; re-Appalaches regions of Quebec . It&amp;rsquo ; s in our homes , schools , hospitals , roads and infrastructure . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Breathing in asbestos fibres was associated with cancer as early as the 1930s , and most developed countries banned its use decades ago . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;176546;TOOLONG ... title= " Mountains of asbestos-laced tailings around Thetford Mines are an eyesore on the horizon , but also a hazard and a potential source of economic renewal .

" data-portal-copyright= " Christinne Muschi " **28;176581;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1721959 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 2016 &lt;b&gt; , &lt;/b&gt; Prime Minister Justin Trudeau finally announced a ban on the import , sale , use and export of asbestos and products containing asbestos in Canada . But the ban , which came into force in 2018 , exempted asbestos residues , leaving the door open for companies in the former mining region to exploit the tailings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A half-dozen companies are poised to use the residues as raw materials , extracting valuable metals like magnesium , silica and manganese . Some want to produce magnesium ingots for car manufacturing , others to make fertilizer , or sand , for cutting steel and sandblasting . The tailings still contain asbestos fibres &amp;mdash ; about 20 per cent of their volume , on average &amp;mdash ; but the companies claim the fibres are completely destroyed in processing . So , they argue , these projects would not only create wealth , they would remediate waste sites . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The residues represent a significant economic opportunity . Entrepreneurs told the commission that billions of dollars stand to be made and hundreds of jobs created in a region that desperately needs them . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But there is concern that digging into and transporting the residues will send deadly fibres into the air , thus putting the health of workers and locals at risk . That&amp;rsquo ; s why Premier Fran&amp;ccedil ; ois Legault&amp;rsquo ; s Coalition Avenir Qu&amp;eacute ; bec government asked the BAPE to investigate . The mandate was announced in September and the commission , led by environmental toxicologist and public health expert Joseph Zayed , must deliver its report to the government by July 24. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The commission held eight days of hearings in Thetford Mines and Asbestos in December , and will be back in both towns this week for a second and final round , starting Tuesday in Thetford Mines . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In January , the commission held five days of intensive sessions in Quebec City which brought together a veritable Who&amp;rsquo ; s Who on asbestos from Quebec and around the world .

Public health experts have been advocating for a lower limit here for decades , and workers&amp;rsquo ; unions , such as FTQ Construction , have recently joined that call . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;About 28,000 workers are manipulating asbestos-containing materials&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp ; on the job in Quebec . These workers are mainly in the fields of construction , maintenance and renovation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Between 2005 and 2015 , 1,107 deaths from asbestos-related illnesses&lt;/strong&gt; were confirmed in Quebec , which means asbestos exposure was the cause of 85 per cent of all workplace-related deaths recognized by Quebec&amp;rsquo ; s workers&amp;rsquo ; safety agency , the Commission des normes , de l&amp;rsquo ; &amp;eacute ; quit&amp;eacute ; , de la sant&amp;eacute ; et de la s&amp;eacute ; curit&amp;eacute ; du travail ( CNESST ) . On average each year , the CNESST confirms 250 diagnoses of asbestos-related illnesses and 120 deaths from on-the-job asbestos exposure . Experts told the commission those stats are just the tip of the iceberg . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Death and illness generally come decades after asbestos exposure&lt;/strong&gt; and many workers don&amp;rsquo ; t realize they were exposed . Many are refused compensation because their employers contest their claims . The commission heard that deaths and illness are under-reported by workers , under-diagnosed by doctors and under-recognized by the CNESST. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Quebec compensates fewer workers&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp ; for asbestos-related illnesses than Ontario and British Columbia , in absolute numbers , even though the mines were here and asbestos was more heavily used in Quebec than in other provinces . The CNESST does not keep track of how many asbestos-related claims are refused . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;176841;TOOLONG ... title= " Even when companies provide the best available equipment , workers end up breathing asbestos dust , a researcher told the commission .

After 2002 , when the Quebec government adopted an official policy with the stated goal of increasing the use of chrysotile asbestos across the province , the practice increased substantially . Between 1988 and 2011 , a total of 1.34 million tonnes of asbestos asphalt was used on more than 1,000 kilometres of Quebec roadways , authorized by the province&amp;rsquo ; s Transport Department , mainly in the Estrie region , as well as the Centre-du-Qu&amp;eacute ; bec , Bas-Saint-Laurent and Chaudi&amp;egrave ; re-Appalaches regions . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The cost of pulling up asbestos asphalt&lt;/strong&gt; when it needs to be replaced is between $50 and $250 a tonne , or about 15 times the cost of replacing conventional asphalt . Special equipment and worker protection measures are required , and the asphalt must be trucked to a specialized dump for disposal . The Transport Department has developed a technique to stabilize the asbestos dust by adding a binding substance during removal . Its plan is to eventually establish about 20 sites around the province where this stabilized waste can be used to build permanent highway infrastructure , such as wind screens , or to shore up embankments . Sites will be chosen along roadways unlikely to require future expansion or reconfiguration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Asbestos removal is too often done by uncertified companies or homeowners who do n't understand the risk&lt;/strong&gt; , said Gilles Mercier , president of AVAQ . He pointed to what he called exemplary public awareness campaigns conducted by &lt;a href= " https : //www.worksafebc.com/en " &gt;WorkS ... and suggested Quebec should follow that lead . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;176906;TOOLONG ... title= " More than 1,000 kilometres of roadways in Quebec are paved with asbestos asphalt .

In her research , she visited asbestos removal worksites and interviewed workers . She found that even when companies provide the best available equipment , workers end up breathing asbestos dust . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; They told me the hardest thing was to drink water .

So they get thirsty , but if you want to drink water , you have to leave the site and to leave the site , you have to do the whole procedure of showering etc . What they told me was there was an informal agreement between ( management ) and workers that instead of taking a morning break and an afternoon break , as well as a lunch hour , they would take a longer lunch break so as not to have to take a shower four times , but only two . What this meant was that they would be on the site for five hours without drinking water . So what the guys would do was bring their own bottle of water and at certain points just remove their masks and take a drink of water . &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CNESST inspectors often forewarn employers&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp ; they will be showing up to inspect work sites . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Legal penalties for employers who are caught cutting corners on asbestos **25;176971;TOOLONG are lower in Quebec than in other provinces . An employer who intentionally exposes a worker to asbestos is liable to a fine of $68,721 here . In Ontario , the fine is $1.5 million and one year in prison .

Can it help detect COVID-19 ? <p> While rapid kits can be used as a screening tool , their efficacy needs to be assessed before regulatory approval , an Australia-based researcher said Mahmud Hossain Opu/Al Jazeera <p> Dhaka , Bangladesh - A group of scientists in Bangladesh has developed a $3 testing kit they claim can detect coronavirus in less than 15 minutes . <p> The South Asian nation 's pharmaceutical regulator - the Directorate General of Drug Administration ( DGDA ) - gave its green light for the mass production of the kit last Thursday , saying it would ease the pressure on the pathology services struggling with coronavirus detection . <h> More : <p> Bangladesh 's largest vernacular daily Prothom Alo reported last week that only 1,732 testing kits are available in a country of nearly 180 million people . <p> Besides , according to a report of The Business Standard , the Bangladesh government has so far prepared only 29 intensive care unit ( ICU ) beds for COVID-19 patients in five Dhaka hospitals . <p> Most private hospitals that have ICU facilities are refusing to admit patients with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit developed in China <p> The kit developed by Bangladesh 's Gonoshasthaya-RNA Biotech Limited is similar to one developed in January by scientists in China as the coronavirus outbreak intensified in the Chinese province of Hubei . <p> A report by The Guardian said the Australian regulatory authority " urgently approved four Australian companies " to import the testing kit developed by the Chinese scientists after those companies sought to supply it into the Australian market . <p> Bangladesh is already struggling with coronavirus testing , with reportedly only 1,732 testing kits are available in a country of nearly 180 million people Mahmud Hossain Opu/Al Jazeera <p> Some experts say that because the kit looks for antibodies produced by the white blood cells in response to the virus rather than the virus itself , there is a margin of error where it could return a false negative if used at the wrong time . <p> The standard laboratory test for coronavirus is known as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , which detects the virus 's genome rather than antibodies produced to fight it . <p> Dr Bijon Kumar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kit , told Al Jazeera that their test , known as the ' dot blot test ' , looks for antibodies in the blood that are created in response to a given virus . <p> " Coronavirus or any types of virus enter the body through the nose , mouth or eyes , then attaches to cells in the throat that produce a protein , " said Sil . <p> He said viruses are made up of an outer shell of protein , which carries the virus 's DNA or RNA - the genetic code with the instructions for making new copies of the virus . <h> ' It 's cheap to produce ' <p> The infected cell reads the RNA and begins making proteins which eventually multiplies the virus , said Sil . <p> " But as the infection progresses inside the human cell , the human immune system at one stage produces specific antibody in blood to fight against the specific virus , " he said . <p> " Antibodies are one of the key weapons against viruses in our immune system 's arsenal , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific antibody in the blood created by the white blood cell in response to coronavirus , " he said adding that the antibody assays use blood serum , saliva and sputum samples to provide the results within few minutes . <p> Dr Sil invented a similar kit for detecting the SARS coronavirus while working in Singapore during the outbreak of the respiratory disease in 2003 . The Chinese government later bought the patent of the kit he developed as it was proven to be effective in detecting the SARS coronavirus " in most cases " . <p> " The best part of this rapid kit is it 's cheap ( approximately $3 ) to produce unlike the RT-PCR testing kit which one is expensive , " he said . <p> An RT-PCR kit costs about $120 to $130 . A specialised biosafety lab is also needed to house a PCR machine , each of which may cost $15,000 to $90,000 , Dr Mohibullah Khondoker , a member of Dr Sil 's research team said . <p> Khondoker said only a few pathological laboratories in Bangladesh has the desired biosafety level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blot test can be conducted by most of the laboratories " . <h> Limitations of the dot-blot kit <p> Dr Md Shajedur Rahman Shawon , researcher at Centre for Big Data Research in Health , University of New South Wales in Australia , however , said ' dot blot test ' has its disadvantages . <p> Shawon said the rapid kit looks for antibodies in the blood produced in response to infection by coronavirus , whereas the RT-PCR looks for the virus itself ( through RNA extraction ) in respiratory specimens . <p> " Since the rapid test relies on the presence of a sufficient amount of antibodies in the blood , factors like timing of the test , previous infections , immune status of a person , cross-reaction with other antigens , can produce false results , " he said . <p> The Australia-based researcher said the false results could take two forms : false-negative and false-positive . <p> The false-negative results will tell a person who is actually infected with coronavirus that they are not , which could lead to them spreading it further because they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , a false-positive result tells a person that they are infected when , in fact , they are not .

So when we developed our kit , we kept the cost in mind and tried to make it as cheap as possible , " he said . <p> Khondoker added that they are working day and night to increase the efficiency of the test kit . <p> " You understand this is no less than a war-like situation now .

Yesterday I just started watching " For Life " on ABC , and I dig it . I 'm also watching some of the classics , like " The Wire " and " Luther .

Walker show ( " Self Made " ) on Netflix . <p> And I 'm teaching Tommy Yola how to play chess right now . I have this really dope chess board that my barber on the show , P. Scott , made . He 's also an artist , and all the pieces are made out of repurposed tools like hammers , screwdrivers -- it 's really rustic looking .

I 've never been one for a serious routine , but the one thing I 've done during this is , I get up and I make my bed ( laughs ) . That comes from my home training from my mother ; we used to have to keep our bedroom doors open and that meant your bed was made . <p> By nature I 'm a homebody , so this is an excuse for me to stay at home and not feel guilty . I 'll tell you , I 'm above the age of 65 and I 'm diabetic , so literally when the show was shut down , I came home and I have n't been out of the house since . My partner , Steven , works in Seattle , and I work in Chicago , but both of us came home to New York , and it makes a difference that we can be together . <p> How have you been spending your days ?

I have a computer in there that I 'm not using anymore . And I 'm shredding like mad . So that 's what I 'm doing . I 'm starting in that room and then I 'm going to go through the apartment and do a spring clean . <p> Are you planning meals or improvising ? We 're sort of planning it out . When I got home , Steven was already here , so he had done a lot of shopping . <p> But we realized the one thing he could not find -- because he 's the one who is venturing outside -- are disinfecting wipes .

@@31745841 <p> That said , the broad strokes of the bill 's most consequential provisions are now sufficiently visible to appraise . Here is a ( not remotely comprehensive ) rundown of what 's good , bad , and mediocre about the largest bailout in American history . <h> The good : <p> Aid to the unemployed that will replace 100 percent ( or more ) of lost wages for low-income workers -- including freelancers . <p> This is the bill 's crown jewel . The provision will : <p> * Increase standard weekly unemployment benefits by $600 for the next four months . <p> * Establish a new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program that will provide workers who do not ordinarily qualify for unemployment insurance -- such as freelancers , furloughed workers , and independent contractors -- with a weekly payment equal to one-half of the state average unemployment benefit plus $600 . <p> * Extend the duration of unemployment benefits by 13 weeks . <p> As Slate 's Jordan Weissmann notes , $600 a week is what a worker with a $15-an-hour wage would reap from 40 hours of labor . Add that to existing unemployment benefits and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during their first four months of unemployment than they did while on the job . <p> This will make America 's wage replacement policy more generous for low- and middle-income workers than analogous programs recently adopted in European social democracies . Which is as it should be , given that U.S. workers lack access to the myriad social insurance programs that reduce European laborers ' costs of living . <p> Here 's a quick analysis I did for average weekly benefits under alternative replacement rates and max benefit caps . The $600/week boost is ( in net ) more generous than what I and others had proposed , which is quite remarkable.4/ **26;2640;TOOLONG <h> The mediocre : <p> One-time cash payments to all non-rich households . <p> Individuals who earn less than $75,000 a year will receive $1,200 in cash , while couples who earn under $150,000 will receive $2,400 , plus $500 for every child in their care . Americans who earn a bit more than those totals will still get checks , but the value gradually declines as the recipient 's reported income rises until it finally hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home $198,000 . <p> Compared to nothing -- or the GOP 's initial plan to give less money to poor Americans than to middle-class ones -- this provision is good . It will single-handedly increase the annual income of the poorest fifth of Americans by 16.33 percent , according to the Tax Foundation . Compared to what House progressives had been pushing , however , it is lackluster . For example , the House Financial Services Committee 's chairwoman , Maxine Waters , had proposed providing all Americans with monthly $2,000 checks for the duration of the pandemic . <p> Another shortcoming of the bill 's cash assistance measure ( or , perhaps more accurately , of America 's state capacity ) is that aid wo n't actually reach those who need it most until long after the bill is signed into law . Eligible Americans who have signed up to receive their tax refunds via direct deposit will receive their payments within a few weeks , according to the New York Times . Those who have not already submitted their banking information to the IRS , or who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not see cash relief until four months after the bill clears Donald Trump 's desk . <p> Small businesses will get loans that are forgivable , so long as they do n't fire workers . <p> Businesses with fewer than 500 employees will be eligible for loans to help cover the cost of payroll , benefits , utilities , rent , mortgage payments , or other debts . If businesses maintain staff , then every dollar of credit they spend on those aforementioned expenses will be forgiven by the government . <p> A measure along these lines was vitally necessary to keep much of the U.S. service sector on life support -- and thus leave it in a position to rapidly recover once social-distancing protocols can be safely relaxed . If restaurants ( to take one example ) are allowed to fail en masse , many will never return , while resilient restaurateurs will still need to assemble and train new staffs ( if not find new locations ) , thereby weakening and slowing the service sector 's recovery . <p> Compared to nothing , then , the small-business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has allocated to the program is almost certainly insufficient to keep every eligible small business alive for the duration of the crisis , or so many conservative economists have argued . Meanwhile , it is unclear how quickly the Small Business Administration will be able to get these loans to the myriad enterprises that are currently on the brink of insolvency . <p> States will get desperately needed ( but woefully inadequate ) federal funding . <p> The coronavirus has afflicted state governments with a wide range of miserable symptoms . Their spending on Medicaid , hospitals , and pandemic response measures is climbing , while their revenues are collapsing and the interest rates of their debt inch upward . <p> The Senate bill will reportedly provide states with $150 billion in funding for defraying the cost of Covid-related expenses . Which is better than nothing . But the sum total is too low , and the restriction on the use of the funds is small-minded . The true cost of fighting Covid-19 ca n't be measured exclusively in state spending on health care and public health . Enforcing lockdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected revenue . Ohio Governor Mike DeWine earned accolades for taking early , proactive measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus in his state . But one consequence of those acts of responsible governance is that the Buckeye State 's Treasury is getting depleted fast . As a result , DeWine is now calling for 20 percent across-the-board cuts to Ohio 's budget . <p> Unless Congress sends more relief to the states , federal stimulus will be undermined by state-level austerity as teachers and other public workers lose their jobs or suffer steep pay cuts that depress consumer demand in local economies , undermining basic government services . <h> The bad : <p> The bill ( arguably ) approves $4.54 trillion for a plutocracy-stabilization fund . <p> The legislation doubtlessly features a wide array of unseemly provisions . Given the dire necessity of getting immediate aid to individuals and small businesses , however , one might forgive a bit of small-bore tribute to the gods of K Street . <p> But $4.54 trillion is a little much . <p> No , the legislation does not directly award large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it affords ordinary workers or small businesses . But in practice , there 's reason to think that it will . <p> Officially , the bill devotes $500 billion to shoring up the corporate sector , with a fraction of those funds earmarked for airlines and firms critical to national defense ( and/or the military-industrial complex ) like Boeing and General Electric . But $454 billion of that total will go toward backstopping new Federal Reserve lending programs that principally benefit big business . To elucidate this point in plain English : It is normal for private banks to maintain a 10-to-1 ratio between the amount of money they 've loaned out and the amount of capital they actually have on hand . The Fed has not yet specified the exact leverage ratio that it will apply to that $454 billion Congress appropriated , but some officials have indicated that 10-to-1 is about right . Which means that Congress 's appropriation is ( potentially ) sufficient to supply corporate America with more than $4 trillion in subsidized financing . <p> There remains ambiguity about exactly how this giant pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion wo n't support loans exclusively to large corporations but also to select , creditworthy small businesses , along with state and local governments . That said , the common understanding among legislators and reporters is that the bulk of this money will go toward supplying credit to big firms ( which is why there are separate sections of the legislation devoted to supplying loans to municipalities and mom-and-pops ) . <p> Some may find the disparity between the scale of financing the bill provides to big business -- and that of the relief it directs to everyone else -- objectionable , in and of itself . But the most offensive aspect of the corporate-aid package is its dearth of conditions . Progressive Democrats had proposed requiring corporations that accept public financing to forswear layoffs for the duration of the crisis , adopt a $15 minimum wage for their employees , give workers representation on their boards , swear off stock buybacks , and give the public an equity stake in exchange for assuming the risk of investing in their enterprises . <p> None of these conditions seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislation , bailed-out companies will be barred from laying off more than 10 percent of their workers for the next six months ( better than nothing but not great ) . And entities personally owned by the Trump family will not be eligible for the Fed 's loans ( though they will be eligible for other forms of corporate welfare ) . Meanwhile , Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin will have the power to forfeit any gains the public might earn on its investments and to give subsidized firms the freedom to transfer the public 's funds to their ( overwhelmingly wealthy ) shareholders in the form of dividends . <p> Some may question the government 's entitlement to dictate terms to companies that accept its relief . After all , this crisis is not analogous to 2008 . Unlike the Wall Street banks that reaped bailouts 12 years ago , the firms seeking aid today bear no direct responsibility for the catastrophe that threatens their survival . The state itself is arguably more culpable . After all , it was the federal government 's belated response to the burgeoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic activity . So why should n't Uncle Sam compensate the enterprises his own negligence has imperiled , at least in the form of no-strings-attached financial support ? <p> Some progressives have tried to answer this objection by suggesting that large corporations would n't need any bailout if they had n't squandered their record-high profits on payouts to CEOs and shareholders . As the American Prospect 's David Dayen writes : <p> It 's not a bailout for the coronavirus . It 's a bailout for twelve years of corporate irresponsibility that made these companies so fragile that a few weeks of disruption would destroy them . The short-termism and lack of capital reserves funneled record profits into a bathtub of cash for investors . That 's who 's being made whole , financiers and the small slice of the public that owns more than a trivial amount of stocks . <p> But this seems misguided in two respects . First , it does not seem realistic to expect corporations to maintain capital reserves large enough to survive an economic shock as vast and unprecedented as that which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undesirable for corporations to hoard cash at that scale , anyway . The problem is n't that corporations have n't been sitting on enough money to survive a pandemic but that they 've been spending their savings on executive compensation and dividends instead of on wages and productive investment . <p> To put this point in more expansive terms : The reason why the government should force corporations to accept stringent pro-worker terms on any bailout funds is not that those firms brought financial calamity on themselves through profligacy . Rather , the government should demand such terms because they are good in their own right -- and corporate America 's collective misfortune creates an opportunity to force such terms down their throats . <p> The United States has become a grotesquely unequal society in which the top 0.1 percent of the population has commandeered as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent combined . This vast inequity in asset ownership compounds itself on an annual basis as corporations toss off dividends to those rich enough to own their shares . And economic inequalities inevitably translate themselves into political ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and legislative processes . Corporations can easily shoulder the expense of effective political engagement ; their median employee can not . <p> For these reasons , it is very difficult to rewrite the plutocrat-friendly rules of our market economy in ordinary times . The lobbying prowess of big business , combined with our legislative system 's myriad veto points , conspire to frustrate all attempts at structural change . But the pandemic has temporarily shifted the balance of power between our society 's public , semi-democratic governing institutions ( a.k.a . Congress ) and its private , authoritarian governing institutions ( a.k.a. corporations ) . Who cares how or why corporate America just got knocked on its back ? The point is to take this precious opportunity to kick the wealthy while they 're down , which is to say , exploit their temporary weakness to secure fairer terms for workers , consumers , and taxpayers in our economy 's social contract . <p> Instead , we 're going to assume the risk behind an avalanche of cheap credit that wo n't just help America 's economic royalists get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If economic crises have historically provided rare opportunities for advancing egalitarian reform , they 've also facilitated the consolidation of plutocracies . In the coming months , large , creditworthy firms will be in a position to buy up smaller , struggling enterprises -- or else their assets -- at a steep discount , setting themselves up for windfall profits and greater market share when good times return . <p> Whether congressional Democrats could have forced a Republican president and Senate majority to exploit corporate America 's vulnerability is a question that I do n't have time or space to analyze here . But the fact that the relief package appears more likely to fortify American plutocracy than to undermine it is the legislation 's greatest failing . <p> Supreme Court justices are all " healthy " a court spokeswoman says .

Several internet service providers also signed a pledge with the FCC essentially promising to not take advantage of people relying on their networks more than ever .

@@31749241 <p> CLEVELAND , Ohio -- Cleveland Cavaliers head coach J.B. Bickerstaff was at home on that life-altering Wednesday night . The Cavs had lost to the Bulls in Chicago a night earlier and Bickerstaff wanted to spend one last evening with his wife Nikki and three kids before embarking on a 10-day road trip that was set to begin with a flight to Charlotte the next day . <p> That 's when he heard the rattling news . Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19 , the first known case in the NBA . <p> Bickerstaff , stunned at first , grabbed his phone and texted a few of his friends on the Utah Jazz staff . Then came the aftershock . The NBA moved quickly , announcing that the remainder of the season had been suspended . <p> " It was a surprise , " Bickerstaff told cleveland.com . " Basketball -- and sports in general -- goes on . There are so many things that have happened -- tragedies around the world , Mother Nature , acts of God , whatever it may be -- and sports goes on . That 's the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the severity of the issue . <p> " What I think is even more important is how people view the NBA as a whole and their ability to forward-think in these situations . ( NBA Commissioner ) Adam Silver and the crew had the courage to be the first league to stop or postpone the season and it speaks to what our league is about and how quality the leadership of our league is . " <p> Later that night , Bickerstaff was able to FaceTime one of his buddies , who was in the Jazz locker room waiting to be tested . <p> At that point , many things raced through his mind . Whether his friends were OK . His own health , considering the Cavs had played the Jazz in Cleveland on March 2 . His players . His family . The unknown about the rest of the regular season . Since then , everything has moved so fast and yet so slow all at the same time . <p> Bickerstaff has n't been tested for coronavirus . No one in the Cavaliers organization has . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I do n't feel any effects . My kids are good . My wife is good . I feel like the people who need the test should use the test and they should be the ones getting tested , " Bickerstaff said . " At this point , I 'm comfortable with where we are and the steps that we have taken to protect ourselves . " <p> It 's been about three weeks since the Cavaliers ' last game -- a 108-103 loss that pushed them to 19-46 overall and 5-6 since Bickerstaff took over for John Beilein . <p> By all accounts , the Bickerstaff era had gotten off to a promising start . The Cavs had a trio of wins against playoff teams -- Denver , Miami and Philadelphia . They were much more competitive , exhibiting a selfless style . Bickerstaff was starting to see growth in late-game situations . He had even finalized a new multi-year deal , officially making him the head coach through 2023-24 . After a tumultuous season , there was a feeling of ease inside the locker room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive test , everything changed . <p> There are deeper concerns . Health , safety , quality of life . More important things to consider . But there are also 17 games on the Cavs ' schedule . Bickerstaff was hoping to capitalize on that time . He still is . <p> " I would hope to play the final 17 games , to be honest with you , " he said . " Where we are and how important that is to us as a team in building and the taste it can leave as we go into what would have been a summer break -- guys wanting to go out , work , prepare and get better because they start to see some things heading in the right direction . That momentum I think was going to be and would be important for us . <p> " The toughest thing in this league is learning how to win and we were starting to get to the point in fourth quarters . So , for us as a group , that 's meaningful . Obviously the league will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans , but for us , I would love to have those games . " <p> Does Bickerstaff , who has been in the NBA since 2004 , have any guess on what will happen ? <p> " Not at all . I know they will be relentless in their effort to do what 's best by everybody , " Bickerstaff said . " By everybody , it 's not just the teams that are involved , but all of our fans . Sports have always been a release for everybody . You have a tough day at work or whatever , you can come home , watch the Cavs and lose yourself for two and a half hours in that . This point in time , with all the stuff going on , I think it would speak volumes when it gets back . I think it will be a celebration . Make a huge impact on people 's lives . " <p> For now , he 's still bunkered inside his lakefront home alongside his family . He 's been in touch with doctors and medical personnel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a broader understanding of the virus , the timeline , symptoms and any exposure concerns . <p> Like many of his players , Bickerstaff has turned his focus toward helping . About a week ago , he donated an unspecified amount to the Greater Cleveland Food Bank and Children 's Hunger Alliance . <p> " It 's something that my wife and I have always kind of had a passion for , " Bickerstaff said . " Having kids of my own , there 's nothing that would pain me more than to see kids having to go without food . That starts everything , right ? If you do n't have food , you go to school and your mind is not focused because you 're hungry and then you ca n't exercise because you do n't have the energy . <p> " Just trying to figure out a way where we could help as much as possible and then with a focus on kids being able to take meals home or have meals delivered , I think that was a thing that was most important . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bickerstaff 's typical day starts with home-schooling in the morning . Then there 's an afternoon workout , lunch , film and phone calls -- with his coaching staff , players , friends , out-of-town family . <p> He thinks staying connected during this time is vital . He has also devoted an hour each day to what he calls " P.E . time " that he runs for his kids , hoping to keep them active and engaged . According to Bickerstaff , his wife handles most of the other activities . <p> " It 's been good , " Bickerstaff said . " Just being able to spend time with them every day is different for us considering what we are used to doing with the travel and stuff . " <p> On the table is a 1,000-piece puzzle that is in the early stages of completion . There 's no rush to finish . This stoppage seems like it will last a while . <p> The other night , Bickerstaff watched The Banker -- a movie about two African-American entrepreneurs who hire a working-class white man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pose as a janitor and chauffeur . <p> " Really good movie , " Bickerstaff said . " I would recommend that to everybody . " <p> He also just started Tiger King on Netflix . <p> " We 're like three episodes in , " he said while laughing . " So far , it 's been entertaining . " <p> The only time he gets in his car : To make a trip to the nearby car wash . He has n't even been to the grocery store . He 's used to being at the practice facility or an NBA arena . He 's grown accustomed to having face-to-face , in-person contact with his players . But this situation does n't allow for that . <p> So , he 's replaced those moments with daily text messages , FaceTime or Zoom calls . He joked that most of the time players answer while sporting gaming headsets . Bickerstaff passes along information for guys to read , some sports-related , some not . He sends TED Talk videos . He recently opened a massive group text with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cavs ' recent surge , ca n't be lost just because games are n't being played and facilities are shuttered . <p> " It 's more about the personal stuff now , " he said . " I 've talked to our coaching staff and have them preparing different projects . They can talk more about the basketball-specific stuff with the guys and then my thing is looking at the big picture and trying to still lay the foundation of the environment and culture that we are trying to cultivate here . ... Then , whatever we can do extra , the organization is willing to do extra . <p> " My conversations are very little basketball . It 's more about how they 're doing , how they 're handling things , what are they doing , who are they with and those types of things . " <p> Through the help of the team 's strength and conditioning guys , Bickerstaff is also trying to make sure everyone stays ready . The training staff has put together videos and written up plans . There are even some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water jugs as dumbbells . He has a Peloton ( and was perturbed that he did n't finish in the top 1,000 riders on his first day ) . Collin Sexton has gone for bike rides and found his way onto a court . Some players have more access to workout equipment than others . If guys need something to stay in shape , the Cavs have sent it . <p> " Obviously not being able to have all the equipment makes it a little more difficult , but our strength guys have done an unbelievable job of putting stuff together to keep guys in the best possible shape physically , but I also think it helps guys mentally too , " Bickerstaff said . <p> " We 're fortunate that we work with really bright people and in the beginning they told us this could be fluid and every single day it could possibly change . We never had long-term expectations . The more we communicate it makes things ... I wo n't say easier overall , but easier for us to handle . "

@@31749641 <h> Rare Spat Between Chinese Diplomats Signals Split Over Trump <p> ( Bloomberg ) -- An unusual public spat between two top Chinese diplomats points to an internal split in Beijing over how to handle rising tensions with a combative U.S. president . <p> The differences spilled into public view Monday after China 's ambassador to the U.S. reaffirmed his opposition to promoting theories that the virus that causes Covid-19 originated in an American military lab . Ambassador Cui Tiankai said in an interview with " Axios on HBO " that he stood by his Feb. 9 statement that it would be " crazy " to spread such theories , even though a foreign ministry spokesman has repeatedly floated the idea on Twitter in recent weeks . <p> " Such speculation will help nobody . It 's very harmful , " Cui told Axios . " Eventually , we must have an answer to where the virus originally came from . But this is the job for the scientists to do , not for diplomats . " <p> Cui 's comments represent a sharp public rebuke to foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian , who has publicly questioned whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may have been introduced by U.S. Army athletes . Such public differences are rare among Chinese officials who are famous for their ability to stick closely to the Communist Party 's official line . <p> Read the latest coronavirus updates <p> The developments suggest that China 's foreign ministry may be having second thoughts about taking a more confrontational approach toward President Donald Trump . The foreign ministry later Monday posted a Chinese-language transcript of Cui 's remarks on its website and another spokesman , Geng Shuang , told reporters " the virus should not be linked to a specific country or region to avoid stigmatization . " <p> " Ambassador Cui is a professional and an adult . His Axios comments should be taken as authoritative , " said James Green , a senior adviser for geopolitical consulting firm McLarty Associates who was previously a U.S. trade official in Beijing .

" In recent weeks , Zhao has promoted theories that the coronavirus roiling the world was present in the U.S. before the outbreak in China , a narrative that also circulated on state media . <p> Such rhetoric has prompted a debate among Chinese diplomats .

" Trump has taken to calling the pathogen the " Chinese virus " and has blamed the U.S. 's outbreak on China 's early failures to control the disease . <p> " As you know China tried to say at one point -- maybe they stopped now -- that it was caused by American soldiers , " Trump told reporters March 18 .

@@31750941 <p> Earlier this month , activists protested in front of the Supreme Court to demand ongoing access to abortion . <p> Jacquelyn Martin/AP/Shutterstock <p> On March 18th , as the reality of the coronavirus crisis was becoming painfully apparent to Americans , the Idaho legislature was turning its attention to healthcare concerns of another kind : making sure that women were denied access to abortion at some nebulous future date . Across the country , state legislatures had gone into recess , heeding the social distancing advice of medical professionals . Not Idaho . For at least an hour on the floor of the House , there was vigorous debate over Senate Bill 1385 , a so-called " trigger law " that would immediately criminalize abortion in the state if Roe v. Wade were overturned or a constitutional amendment gave states the right to criminalize it themselves . Under the law , performing an abortion would be a felony , except in instances of officially-reported rape or incest , or to save the life of the mother . " Everyone needs to face the consequences of their own personal choices , " Representative Megan Blanksma said in her closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way to Governor Brad Little 's desk to be signed , which it was last Tuesday . <h> Related <p> While states like Texas , Ohio , and Iowa have ignored the directives of the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology and used the coronavirus pandemic to attempt to declare abortion a " nonessential " surgery ( Texas ' attorney general even barred medication abortions , which are n't surgical at all -- though a judge blocked those measures , at least for now ) , other states , like Idaho , have forged ahead with business as usual , pushing through anti-abortion ( and anti-trans and anti-affirmative action ) bills while their constituents ' attention is understandably pulled elsewhere . In other words , COVID-19 has provided just the excuse the right has long been seeking to overturn Roe by way of subterfuge . As Rahm Emanuel put it , " Never allow a crisis to go to waste . " <p> In early March , Idaho lawmakers conceded to Governor Brad Little 's plea to transfer a mere $2 million to the Governor 's Emergency Fund to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was considered before the legislature finally adjourned on March 20th . Yet on March 4th , the House had taken the time to pass a bill that would defund Planned Parenthood , pulling money that would never have gone toward abortions ( federal and state money was already restricted in that regard ) but rather would have paid for cancer screenings , STI testing , and birth control . On March 16th , just four days before the indefinite shutdown , the Senate State Affairs committee passed that bill out of committee , readying it for a vote . " We 're talking about life-saving healthcare , and they 're attacking that , " says Mistie Tolman , Idaho State Director of Planned Parenthood Votes , a political action committee . " They 're spending their time in the state House trying to defund a healthcare provider during a global health pandemic . " <p> Despite statements from Governor Andy Beshear asking the legislature to quickly pass a budget and go home , the Kentucky legislature still remains open . That means all eight anti-abortion bills that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consideration , including a constitutional amendment that would declare that there is no right to abortion in the Commonwealth ( if approved by 60% of each chamber , it would go on the ballot at the next general election , where it would need to be approved by a majority of voters ) . On Thursday , the Senate Judiciary committee heard House Bill 451 , which would allow Kentucky 's anti-abortion attorney general to have oversight over abortion facilities and regulations , sidestepping the more neutral Cabinet for Health and Family Services . It would also give the attorney general power to enforce the governor 's ban on elective medical procedures , adding the language that this was " including but not limited to abortion . " After it was passed out of committee with a unanimous vote , Senate Republicans actually tried to fold it into SB 150 , a COVID relief bill -- meaning they tried to restrict healthcare in the very bill meant to provide aid during a healthcare crisis ( it was later removed ) . <p> Meanwhile , SB 9 , a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27th , awaits debate in the Kentucky House when it reconvenes this coming Wednesday . While purporting to protect infants born alive after failed abortions ( a basically nonexistent situation ) , what it would do is further stigmatize the procedure and force doctors to provide life-support to -- and prolong the suffering of -- babies whose medical issues make them unable to live outside the womb . Not only is such a bill controversial , but it 's also redundant with a 2002 bill passed by the U.S. Congress . Its purpose in the face of the current health crisis is baffling . <p> " I mean , the state is practically shut down . Schools are shut down . Daycares are shut down . Movies theaters , bars , restaurants are all shut down . We should n't be fighting controversial bills at this moment . We should be working to help people who are directly impacted by all of these shutdowns who do n't know where their next paycheck is coming from , " says Tamarra Wieder , Kentucky State Director for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills , as the Capital has been closed to the public since March 17th . " There is not an ability for people to democratically participate in this process . " <p> Kentucky Democratic Representative Charles Booker ( who happens to be running for Mitch McConnell 's seat in the U.S. Senate ) agrees . " They 're playing politics , " he tells me . " I know very clearly that they are using this moment -- when a lot of opposition , a lot of opposing perspectives , can not be there -- to quickly move these types of bills forward that they know that they 'd catch a lot of hell for if the public were there . " Out of concern for his health -- and as a type of protest -- he 's refused to show up for hearings or cast his vote on any bill that does not directly address COVID-19 relief or the budget , which the legislature is required to pass before adjourning . " I 'm a type 1 diabetic , and I 've got two little girls , a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me . " Right now our legislature has not been leading by example . " <p> Which calls into question the motives of those legislators who are focusing on pushing abortion legislation instead of on the health and well-being of their colleagues and constituents . " For some legislators , I think abortion is a really held conviction , " Wieder says . " But I think it reinforces that they 're not pro-life ; they 're just pro-birth . " Her hope at present is that , as other states have done , Kentucky will end its session promptly . " I do n't know where this ends , to be honest , " she sighs . " I really don't.

" <p> Data could soon reveal the extent to which the virus is slowing or coming under control , as new infections are stemmed by social distancing and other precautions -- at least at a national level . <p> Wiemken and some colleagues are focused on mortality rates , suggesting that with scarce testing , they 're one of the clearest reflections of the disease and its most serious toll . <p> Based on the progression of coronavirus death rates seen elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get to the peak of its own curve soon -- perhaps in the coming days -- and will then see levels of the disease recede to a more manageable pace . <p> In earlier outbreaks of the virus , the resulting death rates tended to rise and fall over about 30 days . <p> Assuming that the U.S. will experience its own bell curve of the same length , the country is now about halfway through that window -- meaning the national volume of deaths per day could soon crest and start to subside . <p> " We 're still on the left third of the bell curve , currently . How long it takes to get to the plateau , hopefully that 's in the next week , " said Wiemken . " Locally , I have no idea . " <p> The " attack rate " of the virus -- which shows the proportion of the local population that is infected -- offers another snapshot of risk . In the St. Louis region , for example , coronavirus currently infects about 1 in every 10,000 people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 times greater . <p> Hospitalization rates are another vital area to track . <p> " It will be very interesting to follow the curve of the hospitalizations over the next two to four weeks , " said Dr. Elvin Geng , a professor of medicine in Washington University 's Division of Infectious Diseases . " That may be some hint about where we are with the size of the underlying epidemic . " <p> Turabelidze said the state , unlike regional hospitals , has n't produced a model " good enough " to predict the rise and fall of the virus in Missouri . <p> " All these parameters are unpredictable , and therefore it 's very hard to have a model that we all agree is very accurate , " he said . <p> Area researchers generally agreed . <p> " We do n't know what 's going on , " said Wiemken . " It 's not even the tip of the iceberg of what we know . It 's like the tip of Jupiter . " <h> 30 days <p> Experts warn that deciphering the trajectory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply watching the overall total of confirmed cases . As more testing is done , it will be difficult to sort out how many new cases reflect transmission of the disease , and how many are the result of more widespread sampling . <p> And when the shape of the curve comes into focus , it still wo n't reflect the current level of the threat , thanks to the two- to 14-day lag time from when infection occurs and when symptoms show up . <p> " When we perceive it , we 're behind , " said Dr. Gregory Storch , a pediatrics professor and infectious disease specialist at Washington University 's School of Medicine . " If we 're going by cases , we 're reacting to events that happened one to two weeks earlier , and that is a challenge . " <p> From this stage forward , it 's all about minimizing the spread of the disease to as few people as possible , or what some call the basic reproductive rate of the virus . <p> " If every case gives rise to less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its own , " said Geng . " But if each case gives rise to more than one , then the epidemic will propagate . " <p> Multiple experts said the fight against the coronavirus , even if initially successful , could resemble more of a roller coaster over time , with later , smaller peaks and valleys . <p> " There are gradations in the way we 'll go back to normal , " said Ana Santos Rutschman , a St. Louis University professor with a focus on health law . She says those plans need to be crafted well in advance by public health experts , and clearly communicated to the public . <p> Before that " exit strategy " begins , there will also need to be safeguards in place , such as widespread testing capacity and ready-made plans to intervene again , if needed . <p> " We 're going to be ready to push the button and get back to where we are now , " said Wiemken , who hopes that " tailored relaxing " of current restrictions can happen in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier . <p> " There is light at the end of the tunnel if we can just keep this up a little bit longer , " said Wiemken .

@@31751841 <p> Marc Lipsitch is a professor of epidemiology and the director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health . <p> March 23 , 2020 at 7:54 AM EDT <p> As an infectious disease epidemiologist who has worked on pandemics for two decades , I 've talked in recent days to journalists and health officials in the United States and from halfway around the world about how to stop the novel coronavirus that causes the disease covid-19 . They all have the same questions : How many tests do we need ? How should we use tests ? For each case we know about , how many more cases are out there ? What 's the best way to find undiagnosed cases ? Should we do " active case finding , " which involves testing everyone who is mildly ill , then isolating known cases and quarantining and isolating their contacts ? Instead -- or in addition -- should we implement intense social distancing , close schools and take other similar measures ? <p> Everyone asks the same important , interrelated questions . In one respect , the answer is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our testing capacity . No country has controlled transmission effectively without massive testing capacity . The United States currently has a sliver of the capacity we need , which is a tiny fraction of that available in other countries . South Korea has performed over 320,000 tests -- almost one for every 150 people . That is 30 times the testing per capita that we have done in the United States . Exceptional teams are racing to solve testing bottlenecks at local and state levels -- Massachusetts is just one example -- filling the vacuum left by the complete absence of federal leadership . <p> Regulatory and technical hurdles accounted for early delays . Now that we 're past those , several shortages are getting in the way . We do n't have enough protective equipment for testers , nor swabs for sampling or reagents to extract genetic material from the virus . We do n't have enough physical test kits , or enough human power to run large-scale testing . The result is that we have no idea how many people are infected with the coronavirus or how fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other questions about strategy , the best answer depends on local conditions . Different parts of the world , and maybe even different parts of the country , are in very different situations . The best strategy depends critically on which stage of the outbreak you are in and how much testing is available . This is a subject infectious disease epidemiologists have been thinking aboutfor years . My colleagues and I have been adapting their earlier peer-reviewed work to thepresent pandemic . One size does not fit all . <p> A few places -- many of them islands , like Singapore and Taiwan -- have so far kept the epidemic relatively under control . They found and tested most of the initial imported cases ; they deployed a skilled public health workforce to isolate people with the virus and trace and quarantine their contacts ; and they 've managed to maintain a " containment " strategyto good effect . The same can be said of Hong Kong and New Zealand . Iceland has combined containment with massive testing of its population . So far , this strategy has worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep to it unless evidence that it is failing starts to emerge . <p> Containment can work when there are few enough cases that the public health system is able to deal with them and their contacts , so that the workload is manageable , and when a large fraction of cases are tested and identified , so that preventing them from infecting anyone else dramatically reduces the total amount of transmission . <p> For jurisdictions like these , case-based interventions ( isolation , contact tracing and quarantine ) can be the centerpiece of the control strategy -- because they are highly effective . It may be necessary to supplement these with broad social distancing measures , of the sort we have been emphasizing recently in the United States , to snuff out any unobserved chains of transmission that might get past public health authorities . Places like Singapore can afford to keep schools open -- and more generally to impose less stringent social distancing measures -- precisely because the case-based interventions are working . <p> But the situation in the United States right now is very different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most cases here are not being confirmed , even now . We do n't know even approximately how many people are infected , but it 's certainly more than the current count of more than 35,000 confirmed cases . Even though many places are reporting relatively small numbers of confirmed cases , this is not comforting . In many parts of the country , we are seeing rising numbers of flu-like illnesses that when tested , are not flu , and may well actually be covid-19 if only we could test them . <p> AD <p> AD <p> Observations like this convince epidemiologists that the large majority of cases are undetected . Given the various shortages , testing capacity in the short term is limited . But at this point , it 's not going to be possible to find and test all the cases that actually exist , even if we massively ramped up testing . Despite welcome improvements in testing throughout the country , finding and testing all the contacts of confirmed cases when the numbers are increasing this quickly would n't be feasible at the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , any person known to have covid-19 should , of course , be isolated to avoid onward transmission . But this strategy alone -- and the tracing and quarantine of contacts that is central to Singapore 's or Taiwan 's strategy -- is inadequate to the problem we are facing in the United States . It 's just a matter of numbers . If we only know about 1 in 10 cases , then even perfectly effective interventions on known cases can block only 10 percent of transmission . More likely in the United States , we know about an even lower proportion . <p> For this reason , states and localities throughout the country are starting to apply social distancing , a set of policies that can be effective without knowing who is infected or infectious . Implementation around the country has been widely variable , with shelter-in-place orders in multiple sites and minimal interventions to date in others . Intense social distancing must be the centerpiece of our strategy for now . There are reasonable concerns about how long this can continue , but these are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad situation becoming worse . <p> For motivation to stay home , look at Italy , which reported 793 deaths on Saturday alone , and another 651 on Sunday , for a total of 5,476 , and nearly 60,000 confirmed cases . Scant weeks ago , the country had identified only a handful of cases . New York and Washington states are scaling up testing and know they are not far behind ; more worrisome still is a state like West Virginia that has done fewer than 400 tests and already found 12 cases . Such places have truly no way of knowing what they are facing . <p> So how should we use testing ? Unlike in Singapore , at this stage in the United States , there is little benefit in testing most asymptomatic or mildly ill individuals . The test results would not affect their treatment , because we still do n't have any treatment for covid-19 . Isolating these people will not do much to control the epidemic . But individuals who have been exposed to a known case , and individuals with a mild respiratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more than the rest of us are doing . <p> China and South Korea demonstrate that intensive testing and contact tracing , combined with intense ( in China 's case ) or moderate ( South Korea ) levels of social distancing can control the epidemic , even if it 's only temporarily . Among a number of other overdue actions , the White House should coordinate a national effort to achieve a testing capacity like that available in those countries and to get case numbers down to levels where we can plausibly track them individually . Until we get there , public health officials have the unenviable task of explaining why the tests we do have must be reserved for the purposes that contribute most to controlling the epidemic and treating the sickest patients .

@@31754141 <h> How the coronavirus could contribute to a 2020 election meltdown . <p> The November 2020 presidential election wo n't be run perfectly -- we have never had a perfect election conducted in this country or elsewhere -- but the unique challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic add special stress to what was already going to be a difficult election and underline the need to ensure that it is run in a way that maximizes both voter access and integrity . Even before the current crisis , I had been deeply concerned about the chances of a 2020 " election meltdown , " in which the 47 percent or more of the population on the losing side would not accept the results as legitimate . I am even more worried now because of the changes and shortcuts that will be necessary to successfully run November 's tally amid a pandemic . Here is what we need to do to minimize the chances of a November meltdown . <p> The pre-COVID-19 status of Americans ' trust in elections was already troubling . Recent pollingshowed that many Americans worried that votes would not be fairly and accurately counted , with potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my recent book , Election Meltdown , four factors contribute to declining trust in elections . First , Republican legislatures have passed voter ID and other laws making it harder to register and vote , but the kind of voter fraud these laws are supposedly intended to prevent is so small that Democrats can only conclude that these laws were passed to shrink the field of likely Democratic voters . The voter fraud/voter suppression framing of American election administration convinces everyone that the other side is trying to cheat to win . Second , small pockets of election administrator incompetence get outsize attention during close elections . Political actors like President Donald Trump , meanwhile , seek to capitalize on mistakes of incompetent election administrators like Broward County , Florida 's Brenda Snipes -- who resigned after the 2018 midterm election following a series of blunders -- and portray these failures as attempts to rig or steal an election . Third , dirtytricks continue to proliferate in American elections . Finally , partisans have ratcheted up the rhetoric of " stolen " or " rigged " elections , almost always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voter access and integrity . <p> The current public health crisis is only likely to increase the strains on voter confidence . In its massive economic aid package that was signed into law on Friday , Congress is providing only $400 million for states to deal with expected increased costs associated with running the election during the outbreak , a woefully inadequate amount given the Brennan Center for Justice 's $2 billion estimate for additional needs . Congress rejected Democrats ' attempts to require states to offer a no-excuse vote-by-mail option in November for the one-third of the states that still require voters to offer an excuse to vote from home . <p> The lack of federal funding may negatively affect voter confidence in a few ways . First , if the pandemic is still limiting our ability to move freely about society in the fall , the amount of absentee balloting is going to explode whether Congress mandates an expansion of absentee balloting or not . We have already seen the huge growth in absentee ballot requests for Wisconsin 's April 7 primary , along with legal challenges surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an important step in ensuring that even if the virus keeps people away from physical polling places , millions of Americans will have a means of avoiding disenfranchisement . But it is not perfect . <p> Vote-by-mail ballots are more likely to be rejected than other ballots because of problems like signature mismatches . We also know that rejection rates for signature mismatches can disproportionately affect minority voters . Some states do not alert a voter whose ballot has been rejected about the rejection , failing to give the voter a chance to cure something like a purported signature mismatch . Signature matching is also a notoriously subjective endeavor . Even before the coronavirus pandemic , the issue has led to litigation over whether those voters are being unconstitutionally denied their right to vote . Some disabled voters , meanwhile , may need to vote at physical polling places because they lack the physical ability to fill out a ballot at home . These voters too risk disenfranchisement . And in the 11 states without online voter registration , even registering to vote in time for the election may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining only limited hours . <p> Further , some jurisdictions are going to be overwhelmed with the number of absentee ballots to process , whether because of the lack of scanners or workers . There will be stories of notoriously bad election administration in November because we have some election offices in the country with poor leadership and inadequate resources -- problems that will only be exacerbated by the stress of conducting an election under these conditions . Those stories will fit into a " stolen election " narrative , one likely egged on by Russians or others seeking to sow discord and undermine faith in our election . This will be on top of potential virus-related misinformation aimed at particular communities warning them against showing up to vote or telling them to vote at the wrong place or time . <p> Even worse , the need to process millions more absentee ballots without adequate funds and training means November 's election results could well be delayed . This is especially worrying in Detroit and Philadelphia because both cities have a history of poor election administration , and both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-excuse absentee balloting -- and both states play a critical role in the outcome of the Electoral College that determines the presidency . Delay is going to lead to cries of fraud , when in fact good election administration -- especially when dealing with absentee ballots -- takes time . <p> What if Trump is ahead in Michigan and Pennsylvania on election night and he declares victory , but after millions of absentee ballots are processed a week or so later Biden is declared the winner in those states and wins the election ? Will Republicans believe Trump if he claimed the later count was the result of fraud , despite all evidence to the contrary ? <p> Meanwhile , when election fraud -- as rare as it is -- does actually happen in the United States , about a quarter of the time it is because of absentee ballot tampering . In some states it is legal for people to collect an unlimited number of completed absentee ballots from other voters , and that raises the danger not only of fraud but of folks on the wrong side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fraud that led the North Carolina state elections board to require a do-over of the 2018 race for the state 's 9th Congressional District involved the collection and tampering of such absentee ballots . Already we are seeing the usual suspects on the right raise concerns that voter fraud will be rampant with increased vote by mail . Last week , for instance , Republican Rep. Thomas Massie ( the same guy who objected to a voice vote on the federal coronavirus bill and made a majority of House members return to D.C. for a vote ) tweeted , " Universal vote by mail would be the end of our republic as we know it . " <p> So what can we do about this greater potential for a meltdown in November ? The two keys are resources and state-mandated improvements in administration . We know that the election is going to be much more expensive , and we know where many of the problems are . <p> If Congress is not going to step up , states need to find money in their already strained budgets to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assert more authority over local jurisdictions to manage the expected surge in absentee balloting , the added expenses of running polling places consistent with stringent health requirements , and other potential threats to the election like cyberattacks . Too much local control in election administration is a recipe for disaster because in a close election everyone will look at the small number of places where things failed , not the vast majority of places that manage to conduct a single election well . State legislatures need to give state election administrators more power over poorly performing election offices . States also need to advertise and impose heavy penalties on those who would tamper with absentee ballots , especially if states send absentee ballots to all registered voters ( some of whom may have moved or died ) . <p> Already the stress on election administrators in 2020 was high . The virus is likely to be the greatest challenge yet . But we need to ensure that as many people as possible who are on the losing end of the 2020 election believe that it was conducted fairly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to regroup and agree to fight again for public support in the next election cycle .

In this briefing , we consider some of the key issues that employers of UKbased staff should be considering . We address the practical steps you can take to reduce any disruption to your business and the key issues around your duties as an employer . At this early stage , the value of having clear policies in place , from both business protection and employee relations perspectives , should not be underestimated . 1 . WHAT KEY ISSUES SHOULD WE CONSIDER NOW ? At the time of writing the number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus in the UK is relatively low . The UK 's Chief Medical Officers still class the virus as a " low " threat to individuals and a " moderate " threat to the public . It is still not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or specifically in the UK . However , given the significant impact it has already had in China and elsewhere , all employers are advised to put in place robust preparatory and contingency measures now . This is particularly true given the possible longterm nature of the disruption which Coronavirus presents . These measures should include : ? giving a small group of employees ( for example , in HR ) responsibility for monitoring the latest World Health Organisation and UK Government advice on Coronavirus and reporting back regularly to management , advising on potential policy changes ; ? ensuring effective communication with staff regarding Government advice and the approach of the business to Coronavirus issues ; ? introducing a ( flexible ) policy to cover employment issues specific to Coronavirus , including any proposed departures from normal employment policies ; ? minimising the impact of absences from the office and creating a consistent policy on how absences will be managed ; and ? adopting a management plan to protect business continuity in the event of a severe outbreak . For some businesses , for example those regulated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . 2 . WHAT ARE OUR DUTIES AS AN EMPLOYER ? HOW DO WE PROTECT OUR STAFF ? General health and safety duties . Employers have a duty to ensure the health , welfare and safety of all staff in the workplace . They are required to provide and maintain a working environment that is , so far as is reasonably practicable , safe , without risk to health and adequate as regards facilities and arrangements for their welfare at work . Failure to do so could result in both civil and criminal liabilities . This duty is likely to extend to ensuring that staff are not placed at undue risk of infection from Coronavirus . We recommend considering the issues set out in this briefing with that duty in mind . Communication with staff will also be key , including communicating that staff are expected to follow the latest Government guidance . We also recommend the adoption of additional hygiene measures . Many employers are already , for example , providing anti-bacterial wipes and gels in offices and toilets and arranging for all surfaces and equipment to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . Employers should , in accordance with their statutory obligations , conduct risk assessments and monitor the risks posed by Coronavirus to anyone at particular risk . This includes those with pre-existing health conditions , pregnant employees and those who otherwise have compromised immune systems . Although there is currently a low risk of infection in the UK , you should monitor the situation . If the risk profile increases , businesses may want to consider steps to reduce the risk to these individuals such as asking them if they want to work from home . Where somebody 's condition represents a disability under equalities law , the employer may be under a specific duty to make reasonable adjustments . Employers also have statutory obligations to take steps to avoid risks to which pregnant workers are exposed at work . Therefore , if the situation develops it may be necessary to introduce adjustments to pregnant employees ' roles , ask them to work from home , or suspend them on medical grounds . Remember that if pregnant employees are on paid suspension or are off sick in the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maternity leave will start early . Should we be providing staff with face masks ? The medical evidence on the benefit of face masks outside of a clinical setting is not well-established and incorrectly worn masks will not effectively prevent infection . Public Health England advises that the best form of prevention is good hygiene including carrying tissues , washing hands often with soap and water ( especially after using public transport ) , avoiding touching your eyes , nose and mouth with unwashed hands and avoiding close contact with people who are unwell . However , it is important that employers continue to monitor the Government advice . 3 . HOW DO WE MANAGE STAFF MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN ABROAD ? Some employers may find themselves in a situation where staff members are unable to attend the workplace . For instance , some countries have introduced travel restrictions which may prevent staff from getting to work , or they may be in quarantine or self-quarantine in accordance with Government rules or guidance . Indeed , it will be important for employers to be able to ' keep track ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal ) in order to be able to assess which employees should be following Government guidance on self-quarantine . Equally important will be ensuring that the workforce is kept apprised of how fast guidance is developing on which countries to avoid unnecessary travel to . Our advice is that employers should : ? encourage all staff members to avoid any travel to high risk countries ; ? where staff have returned from any countries subject to self-quarantine guidance , try to agree with the individual what , if any , work they can carry out remotely ; ? if it is not possible for the individual to perform any duties whilst absent from the workplace , decide on an approach for your business in relation to pay entitlement , with the aim of applying it consistently . Whilst agreeing to pay staff who are unable to work ( potentially for a prolonged period ) may appear cost prohibitive , this needs to be weighed against the adverse reputational risk of being seen to punish those who self-isolate . It is also possible that staff members could fail to disclose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to avoid financial hardship , which would increase the risk to the rest of the workforce . As we explain below , an employer 's approach to this issue must be carefully considered and the outcome may depend on the particular circumstances . Maintaining flexibility to accommodate changing circumstances is recommended . Some possible scenarios include : Those trapped in mandated quarantine abroad . The legal position here will depend upon the terms of the staff member 's contract and could also engage issues of whether the individual is " able and willing " to work . Businesses may in any event benefit from reflecting their approach to paying those who are in selfquarantine in the UK , in the interests of fairness ( see below ) . Those who have returned from abroad and meet Government guidance for self-quarantine . If a staff member falls within the Government guidance for self-quarantine , they should follow that guidance . The guidance is here and the Government has stated that the Department of Health and Social Care will update the page at 2pm daily until further notice . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ? that those returning from some areas ( which we will call High Risk Areas ) , stay indoors and avoid contact with other people and call 111 even if they do not have symptoms ; and ? that those returning from a number of other countries or regions ( which we will call Higher Risk Areas -- recognising the countries meeting this definition is likely to change as the situation develops ) and who are displaying symptoms , however mild , stay indoors and avoid contact with other people and call 111 . Where staff members meet the conditions for quarantine , they should self-quarantine . Those who have returned from abroad and do not meet Government guidance for self-quarantine . Some businesses are considering taking a more cautious approach to self-quarantine and asking employees not to come to work for 14 days after they ( or in some cases their close family members ) have returned from any Higher Risk Area even where they have no symptoms . This has the advantage of reducing infection risk -- and thereby protecting other staff members -- in comparison to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to work on these preventative grounds should pay their staff in full , even if they are not able to work from home . Employers should consider carefully whether , and what , limits should be placed around any encouragement to self-isolate in excess of Government guidance , and any related pay . For example , businesses may wish to make clear that self-isolation is only encouraged ( and paid ) for those returning from High Risk Areas and Higher Risk Areas as set out in Government guidance , but not elsewhere . It would be prudent to reserve an element of discretion to make ad hoc decisions as the situation changes . For instance , if a staff member returns from an area in which an outbreak developed while they were there but is not yet classified as a Higher Risk Area , you may still wish to encourage self-isolation . Businesses that are offering some form of enhanced pay during sickness or quarantine absence may wish to make it clear that staff members who book travel to a High Risk Area or Higher Risk Area after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or who travel after the FCO advises against all but essential travel to that area , will be required to self-quarantine but will not ( necessarily ) receive any pay above their minimum legal entitlement . However , this may be resource-intensive or difficult to police in practice . For businesses whose staff do not or can not work from home , the above considerations may need to be taken into account alongside issues of potential cost and business continuity . Businesses should particularly bear in mind the upcoming Easter holidays which will most probably result in a lot of staff members travelling abroad , and the potential costs of such a policy in the event of mass absences . It is important in all cases to clearly communicate expectations to your staff . 4 . SHOULD WE RESTRICT BUSINESS ( AND OTHER ) TRAVEL ? The Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) currently advises against travel to a small number of specific regions unless it is essential . Employers should therefore suspend all business travel to these areas , and any other countries or regions in respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it is essential . The FCO 's guidance is available here . Despite these limited restrictions , public concern is likely to result in staff members being less willing to travel abroad for work , especially for conferences with international attendees . Some conferences are already being suspended as a precaution . We recommend that businesses consult with staff members who are concerned about travel to other destinations about whether this travel is necessary and proportionate . Businesses may also want to ask their staff members to let them know if they are planning travel to the above countries and regions , and/ or other areas as the situation develops . See further below on the indirect discrimination issues that should be considered before making decisions of this type . 5 . WHAT IF SOMEONE REFUSES TO COME TO WORK ? The recent news coverage of the virus is understandably causing concern among the general population . However , at this stage , the vast majority of individuals are at a low risk of infection so speaking to your staff about any concerns they have is a good first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home is usual or technologically possible businesses may want to consent to this on an ad hoc basis , provided the 4 individual understands that the situation may change in future . If the individual is pregnant or otherwise at a higher risk , we recommend being more accommodating about requests to work from home or take holiday . 6 . WHAT IF ONE OF OUR STAFF MEMBERS DEVELOPS CORONAVIRUS ? It would be prudent to consider the approach your business would take in the case of a staff member contracting Coronavirus or being placed in quarantine preventatively . This should include : ? Whether this should be announced and if so in what form ( e.g. email , team meeting ) . Bear in mind the data protection rights of the staff member in question regarding their health data , which may mean any communication should be anonymised . Any such announcement should be aimed at reassuring staff members about the current situation ; ? If Government advice at the time requires that people who have been in contact with a confirmed case are informed and/ or self-isolate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate way without causing unnecessary alarm ; ? How the individual will be dealt with under your sickness procedures ; and ? How to reduce infection risk . For example , you may want to arrange a thorough clean of the area that the staff member has worked in . Some businesses already have processes of this type in place for when staff members contract contagious illnesses such as shingles. 7 . HOW WOULD WE REACT TO HIGHER LEVELS OF ABSENCE ? This is a key issue to address in business continuity plans , and if you have not reviewed yours this is a good opportunity to do so . It is good practice to have plans in place which address the possibility of high levels of absence and inability to use the normal workplace ( for example , if travel restrictions are put in place ) . At this stage we recommend businesses carry out an initial review to identify any potential areas of difficulty . We suggest this should include reviewing the following : ? How your business can operate with reduced staffing levels . Are there staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover core business functions ? Although a significant change in job role might allow an employee to argue a fundamental breach of contract ( thereby entitling them to resign and claim constructive dismissal ) , provided their proposed temporary responsibilities are within their capabilities , it may be arguable that it is reasonable for the employer to require them to cover business critical tasks as part of reduced workforce in times of emergency ; ? What scope your business has to ask people to work from home and communicate with their colleagues if they are unable to reach the workplace , for instance due to travel difficulties or caring for dependants ( see below ) , or if the workplace needs to close temporarily . If a workplace closure seems likely , this should be discussed as early as possible with staff ; ? What your procedures are for speaking to staff at short notice , particularly if people are already working from home . You should also ensure that employees ' contact details and emergency contact details are up to date in case individuals need to be contacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask or require staff members to work different or longer hours . Good practice would be to raise this possibility at an early stage and be up-front about expectations and any additional pay . Businesses should check any statements on these issues in existing employment contracts . Employers should also bear in mind that statutory rights which are not normally an issue might need to be considered , such as those around maximum weekly working time , rest periods and the national minimum wage ; ? If remote working or redeployment are impractical or undesirable , your business could recruit temporary or agency staff , particularly in administrative roles . This is , of course , likely to result in additional costs and such individuals will be entitled to the same health and safety protection as the permanent employees for whom they are covering ; and ? What the procedures are where staff members need to take time off to care for dependants who are unwell or whose schools/ nurseries have closed . Normally employees can take unpaid time off to care 5 for dependants or make arrangements for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider what expectations will be communicated around working from home during this period , and / or arranging alternative care . Any communications around this should emphasise that they apply only to this as a response to this particular outbreak . Employers should make sure that all staff members , particularly managers , are aware of the applicable procedures . 8 . DISCRIMINATION RISKS News reports already show that concern about the virus is leading to incidents of racist behaviour . Employers should be mindful that , if this happens in your workplace , it can create a difficult working environment for your staff and can lead to liability for the business . As in all cases of harassment , having a well-publicised anti-harassment and/or equal opportunities policy and mandatory training is important . This should reduce the incidences of harassment and also give the business a potential defence in the case of any harassment by individual staff members . Businesses should also be mindful of indirect discrimination risks when asking staff members to restrict their travel or to work from home or self-isolate after travel to a particular area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be considered carefully in light of Government guidance . ACAS has also noted the importance of ensuring that any policies addressing the outbreak should not be discriminatory , for instance requiring employees of a certain race or ethnicity to wear face masks at work , but not others . 9 . A FINAL THOUGHT People spend a large amount of time at work and inevitably the messages they receive from their employer about Coronavirus will influence their feelings on the matter .

BuzzFeed has also poached BBC digital journo Joey D'Urso to be its new media and politics reporter , replacing the departed Mark Di Stefano . Many congrats to both . <p> WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING : The Super Tuesday votes are still being counted across the pond but it 's been another big night for former Vice President Joe Biden , who now looks like the frontrunner to secure the Democratic nomination . However , left-winger Bernie Sanders is certainly not out of the race yet after winning the largest state , California , as well as Colorado and his home state of Vermont . Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren both struggled badly , and it 's almost impossible to see either candidate pulling this around . Latest here from POLITICO 's D.C. team . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> THREE STRIKES AND YOU 'RE OUT ? Boris Johnson faces prime minister 's questions today with the future of his home secretary now hanging by a thread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all published devastating new allegations of bullying by Priti Patel in a third Whitehall department , with an unnamed senior official now promising to testify against her in any government inquiry or employment tribunal . Patel has again issued a firm denial of any wrongdoing , but the flurry of allegations in multiple departments and across multiple years continue to mount up . Coronavirus may be dominating the headlines , but this is now a full-blown political crisis for the home secretary and Jeremy Corbyn will surely be demanding answers at noon . <p> First read this : The Sun 's Tom Newton Dunn has spoken to three separate officials at the department for international development who allege " shocking " bullying by Patel of her private secretary while in her first Cabinet post . TND reports that after six months the senior official was signed off work with a stress-related illness and asked to leave his post . He was eventually seconded to another department , but has since returned after Patel was forced to quit in disgrace in 2017 . <p> Response : The home secretary says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patel ally tells the Sun : " A small number of civil servants are now actively trying to undermine a senior member of the elected government . Good on Priti for ignoring them . " <p> And now watch this : Shortly after the Sun story broke at 10 p.m. last night , BBC Newsnight 's Nick Watt went on air with further detailed allegations of bullying by Patel while at DfID . It 's worth watching his three-minute clip in full . Watt speaks of a " tsunami of allegations " about Patel 's behavior toward staff in her private office , and says the senior official who collated the claims is now prepared to give evidence on the record to the Cabinet Office inquiry and indeed any future employment tribunal . There 's a BBC Newsnight article here . <p> Response : A Home Office spokesperson said : " The home secretary categorically rejects all of these allegations . " A source from the Conservative Party told Newsnight : " What we are seeing is a concerted effort by certain sections of the civil service to undermine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immigration . It is deeply disturbing that dark forces are trying to influence the findings of a Cabinet Office inquiry . " <p> And yet there 's still more : The Times ' Oliver Wright then revealed further details at midnight , stating that successive permanent secretaries at DfID were aware of serious allegations about Patel 's behavior . He also speaks to a Downing Street SpAd who confirms " there were concerns about her methods of working , " as do several unnamed former ministers . " The Times is aware of about a dozen officials , mainly working in her private offices , who were moved on as a result of demands by Ms Patel , " Wright reports . " Others left of their own accord after being unable to deal with her behavior . They are expected to be interviewed by the Cabinet Office team investigating her conduct . " Once again , Patel denies any wrongdoing . <p> **A Message from Barclays : Our ? 14bn SME fund helped Reading-based Siren Brewery to invest in a canning machine , so that they could start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : This all follows a raft of shocking allegations about Patel 's supposed treatment of staff at the Home Office , culminating in the very public resignation of her most senior civil servant Philip Rutnam on Saturday . He intends to take the case to an employment tribunal , in an unprecedented act by a Whitehall permanent secretary . The following day the BBC broke news of serious allegations about Patel 's behavior at the department for work and pensions when she was a junior minister , and then on Monday quoted legal documents revealing one distraught staffer left with a ? 25,000 pay-off . Patel 's allies last night insisted that case largely pre-dated her time at DWP , and that she was in no way to blame -- see their angry quotes here . <p> Tin foil hats on : The broader claim from Patel 's allies is that this is all some sinister civil service stitch-up , although it 's hard to recall any previous Cabinet minister in , erm , the whole of British political history being treated in such a way . Frankly it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusations we keep hearing from Donald Trump 's supporters ( and occasionally his own Twitter feed ) over in D.C. Which is n't a great look for anyone . <p> Wait for the inquiry : Johnson 's line at PMQs today will be that we must wait for the outcome of the Cabinet Office inquiry , given that none of us actually know the facts as yet . The problem is that Downing Street yesterday could not answer even a single question about the nature of that investigation . How long will it take to get a decision ? Will it be expanded to cover Patel 's behavior at other Whitehall departments ? Will its findings even be made public ? Answers came there none . <p> Fallout : In the short-term Patel looks sure to survive , given the vociferous backing from the prime minister and her refutation of every allegation against her . As the Speccie 's Katy Balls writes in her latest column for the " i , " Patel is highly valued in Downing Street for representing the hardline stance on law and order they believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But plenty of senior Tories believe she simply can not survive this long-term , not least due to very obvious questions over whether she has lost the confidence of the people who work for her . Balls reckons a quiet reshuffle into a less high-profile role may eventually be on the cards . <p> Come together : Patel yesterday emailed all Home Office staff in an effort to rally the troops , saying she regretted Rutnam 's resignation but that it was " now time for the Home Office to come together as one team . " ( Good luck with that , etc . ) She added that she " deeply cared " about the " well being " of her civil servants , and valued their professionalism . How effective this message proves to be remains to be seen . The BBC has more . <p> Do n't wait too long : The big problem for Patel and Downing Street is that Rutnam is not going quietly , and as of last night had begun his legal proceedings against the government . " Legal documents name the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondents , " the Guardian 's Rajeev Syal reports . " It would mean that Patel will be expected to give evidence under oath if the case comes to tribunal . " Yikes . <p> Government of all the bullies , cont. : The Guardian also retrains its fire on Downing Street , suggesting a culture of bullying has taken hold at the heart of the government . It raises the case of former MoD SpAd Lynn Davidson , who has now left government ( h/t Alex Wickham ) only days after telling Dominic Cummings his treatment of other SpAds was " out of order . " No. 10 insists her departure had nothing to do with that widely reported confrontation . But do n't be surprised if Corbyn goes in on this line at PMQs too . <p> Questions for Sedwill : In short it 's all looking like a bit of a car crash , and questions are naturally being posed about the handling of the affair by Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill , whose job it is to make these sorts of problems quietly disappear . The FT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's time Sedwill stopped trying to be national security adviser as well as Cabinet secretary , and instead stayed focused on his civil service role . " It 's Mark 's responsibility to ensure the relationship between the government and the civil service does n't break down , " says one Whitehall insider . " But that is exactly what we 're witnessing . " <h> ? ? GOING VIRAL ? ? <p> KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON : By contrast , the government is rightly winning plaudits for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak , with Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock so far striking the right tone in terms of clarity of message and honesty with the public . Tomorrow should bring the launch of a major public information campaign , with government-issued posters and social media ads stressing the need for vigilance and delivering key messages about the washing of hands . But " there will be no salsa dancing nurses , " one official says drily . For shame . Sadly , it looks like that video was a fake . <p> Whitty banter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty , a trained epidemiologist who has only been in post five months but is impressing people right across Westminster with his knowledge and calm approach . " He is properly impressive , " one colleague tells Playbook . " Massive intellect ... Savvy and smart ... And also totally lovely . " As HuffPost 's Paul Waugh notes , Whitty gave a stellar performance at yesterday 's Downing Street press conference , and has now been handed today 's morning broadcast round including the 8.10 a.m. slot on the Today program . " You 're going to be hearing an awful lot from these guys over the days and weeks ahead , " a government source says brightly . Trusting in your expert officials ? It 'll never catch on . <p> New world order : Most of the papers splash the story again this morning , and it 's the Daily Mail that really nails what seems to be coming down the track with a front page headlined : " Life on hold for three months . " " Lives may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight the deadly coronavirus , " Political Editor Jason Groves reports . " Britons could be asked to suspend their social lives -- ' avoiding contact outside work and school ' -- if the virus took hold . Sources said dramatically cutting back on activities such as eating out , going to the pub , shopping and shows could significantly slow the spread of the contagion . " <p> Warning siren:The Guardian focuses on the impact the outbreak could have on an already-stretched police force , and we may well see renewed Labour attacks today on the decision to cut police numbers by 20,000 over the past decade . The government is committed to restoring those jobs , but clearly recruitment is not going to come in time to deal with this crisis . The paper says options for police chiefs now include " rationing services to respond only to serious 999 emergency calls only such as life threatening-crimes in action , domestic violence , sexual violence and homicides . " One senior source says that " non time-critical homicide investigations " could even be postponed , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Corbyn may also pick this up at PMQs today . <p> State of the nation : Fears over the police 's ability to cope play into a wider concern inside parts of government that what may ultimately trip ministers up is not their response to this specific crisis , but the public service funding decisions made by previous Tory leaders stretching back to 2010 . GPs and NHS hospitals warn they are already close to breaking point , and frustrations at past cutbacks may boil over if things take a turn for the worse this spring . <p> One to watch : The other key thing to keep an eye on is the impact on the economy , and today MPs will hear from the incoming governor of the Bank of England , Andrew Bailey . He gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee at 2.15 p.m . Plenty of observers now expect the Bank to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve and cut interest rates in response to the crisis . <h> LABOUR LAND <p> NEIL BEFORE ME : Labour leadership hopefuls Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they go head to head with the BBC 's Andrew Neil .

Team RLB will be hoping for a big moment tonight to give their candidate a hope of hauling back Starmer 's apparently runaway lead . But most Labour insiders suspect that with voting having begun 10 days ago , the majority of members have already cast their ballots . <p> Reminder : The third remaining candidate , Lisa Nandy , took on Neil back in January and came out on top following a stellar showing . So there 's hope for both Starmer and Long-Bailey tonight . <p> Donation vexation : It follows an escalating row between the Long-Bailey and Starmer camps over how the shadow Brexit secretary is funding his campaign .

In a speech to the well-oiled crowd , Corbyn pledged allegiance to a diet of salad and falafel ( video here ) before promising : " I 'm going to be around for a very long time to come . " Gulp . Corbyn also posed for a ( possibly unsuspecting ) selfie with newly elected " Red Wall " Tory MP Dehenna Davison , who pinched Bishop Auckland off Labour back in December . " We were literally just chatting about kebabs and how we need to bring parmos to London , " she explains happily .

" The Brits have no negotiating f***ing power , " O'Leary explains bluntly , as only he can . " This will finish in only two ways . The British walk away , in which case they 'll be abandoned and there will be no food in the supermarket f***ing shelves . There will be riots in the streets and Boris Johnson will be out of power . Or they will roll over ... They will sell whatever deal they can f***ing do . " Which should go down well in No. 10 .

City Minister John Glen talks Brexit to the Lords EU financial affairs committee at the same time ... and at 10.30 a.m .

SMEs and microenterprises in South Korea are similarly feeling the heat . <p> It is in this context that Singapore 's aggressive use of counter-cyclical economic tools to support this segment of the economy is notable . With an expected economic slowdown due to COVID-19 , the Government announced the Stabilisation and Support Package ( SSP ) to support employment together with the Care and Support Package ( CSP ) to support households . <p> The SSP will continue to fund enhanced programmes such as the Jobs Support Scheme and offer improved support such as the Enhanced Wage Credit Scheme . These schemes may benefit employers directly by subsidising the cost of labour at this point in time but ultimately aids workers by helping them keep their jobs . <p> FEAR OF PROPPING UP ZOMBIE FIRMS <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firms , some may express concerns we are wasting precious limited resources to prop up unproductive firms , which would have seen some natural level of attrition during a down cycle . <p> However , in the context of the SSP , these concerns may be unfounded . <p> Firstly , unproductive firms require disproportionately more support than productive firms in a downturn . Discretionary support that provides unequal levels of financing and grants without considering a firm 's credit worthiness would be required to prop up these firms . <p> By contrast , key schemes in the SSP do not negate commercial discipline . The enhancement to the Enterprise Financing Scheme will require financial institutions to consider firms ' credit worthiness , even as the Government co-shares the risk of default . <p> The Corporate Income Tax rebates target firms earning a profit . Enhancements to the Wage Credit Scheme targets firms that have raised the salaries of workers in the last quarter . <p> The design of such schemes can reduce the mismatch between resource allocation and long-term profitability of a firm . <p> Second , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volatility of productivity may vary over a firm 's life cycle , young companies often find themselves in the red . <p> In assessing the potential impact of these measures on unproductive companies , we must distinguish between high-growth but young companies that may be burning through cash and zombie firms . <p> Zombie firms are non-performing companies , with little business activity and value-add . The term refers to firms that struggle for years , earning low sales , generating low growth and little meaningful employment , with little hope of resurrection , where they copy old ideas instead of pursuing innovation . <p> Many of such low-growth firms may have high debt ratios , fuelled by cheap borrowing in recent years . <p> Temporary measures such as the Job Support Scheme and Wage Credit Schemes will not keep them going after the SSP runs its course . <p> SIMILAR CHALLENGES FACED BY YOUNG , HIGH-GROWTH START-UPS <p> Young high-potential firms on the other hand may face cash flow issues in their initial years , as they pursue breaking even on their initial start-up costs , establish a brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start-ups in rapidly growing sectors like deep tech and artificial intelligence where sunk costs in research and development may take some time to recuperate . <p> Younger companies also tend to experience greater volatility in income compared to older firms , as they seek to grow new revenue streams and pivot their product offerings towards stronger enterprise solutions . <p> But if this higher volatility leads to higher financial costs , young and potentially high-growth firms could be wiped out along with zombie firms during a recession . <p> Fortunately , the most promising high-growth young start-ups have access to investors and government grants , through a plethora of schemes rolled out by the Government under Start-up SG . <p> The COVID-19 outbreak will pass . Ideally , we want to identify and support high- potential SMEs during these times , without skewing incentives to prop up zombie firms . <p> Our best alternative is to support the SMEs as a whole at the potential cost of stringing a few zombie firms along .

The closer the relationship and more foreseeable the harm , the greater the duty . Aside from it being very much the socially responsible thing to do , it stands to reason that this legal duty of care may place a duty on owners and occupiers of buildings to prevent the harm associated with the spread of COVID-19 .

In exceptional cases the legal doctrine of " frustration " ( whereby a truly fundamental matter going to the heart of the contract can not be performed ) or a " force majeure " clause in the lease ( excusing non-performance of an obligation on grounds of a major intervening act ) could be relevant to assist a tenant but neither of these would be widely available .

As an MP , his focus has been mostly on the intersection between science and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Macron 's artificial intelligence strategy and drafted a plan to improve the teaching of mathematics in French schools . He has also been busy reforming the Parliamentary Scientific Office , a bureau that produces technical analyses on a wide variety of issues to help MPs and senators in their legislative work . <h> Advertisement <p> When it comes to Paris , Villani imagines a smarter city orchestrated by new technologies : artificial intelligence would be used to manage traffic flows , rapidly direct street cleaning and waste disposal services wherever needed , and map the public areas requiring maintenance . A new augmented reality app would give tourists access to information on the history of the city 's streets and monuments on their smartphones as they walk by . The app would include multimedia content on movies , artworks and novels about Paris , and it would also suggest original itineraries based on customised criteria - with the goal of promoting especially the less well-known neighbourhoods . <p> But Villani 's manifesto , which he labels as " eco-progressive " , also includes longer-term projects such as a ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris less polluted and more sustainable . That would include modernising the metro network and boosting public transportation , expanding bike lanes , and stepping up renovations to make buildings less energy-consuming . Villani also intends to battle inequality ( particularly in education , reducing the school quality gap between the wealthiest and the poorest neighbourhoods ) and strengthen the ties between Paris and its suburbs to tackle the scarcity of affordable housing . <p> Another major section of his programme is about " giving power back to the Parisians " by introducing new forms of citizen participation in the city 's governance . Ten percent of the candidates for the city council on his lists are simple residents with no previous political affiliation , selected at random from a pool of people that registered online -- a move that vaguely resembles the early days of Italy 's Five Star Movement . He also pledged to hold referendums on issues including school hours and major urban development projects . Finally , Villani intends to create a " citizens ' assembly " , half of which would be made up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NGO and trade union representatives . This " agora " , as he calls it in a reference to Ancient Greece 's public square , would n't simply be an advisory body : it would evaluate the local government 's performance in reducing greenhouse emissions and have a say on which issues the city council should discuss . <h> Read next <h> SoftBank 's $108 billion Vision Fund 2 is on shaky ground <p> ByLaurie Clarke <p> Despite this abundance of visionary ideas , Villani 's bid to become mayor of Paris faces an uphill battle . When we meet for an interview in a caf ? in Southern Paris , nine days ahead of the election 's first round on March 15 , polls still have him lagging in fifth position , over 15 percentage points behind Anne Hidalgo and Rachida Dati .

" Political gimmicks kept getting in the way . There is now more interest in the programmes , but this only started very recently . By the end of the campaign , the debate on what actually matters will have lasted less than a month . " <p> It 's the frustration of a scientist who wo n't fully adapt to the rules of politics , hoping to change them instead . Ideologically he is probably closer to the left than to the right , but he stubbornly rejects to be defined by such categories , arguing that partisanship has stymied the search for effective solutions . " The left-versus-right logic has failed , over the past few decades , to put us on a path to progress , " he argues . With the climate emergency looming , he is convinced that , in the French capital , " there is room for a coalition , a convergence of pro-environment stances from both the centre-left and the centre-right ; a common ground that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably in good faith , Villani does n't seem to believe that policies create winners and losers ; in his opinion , good policies " suit everyone " .

" My job , as a scientist who believes in the passing-on of knowledge , is to help people think . " His " agora " would be the setting for this exchange , offering an answer to the " hunger for debate " among the citizenry that emerged , as he has often noted , when Macron took part in a series of public discussions last year in response to the " yellow vest " crisis . The " yellow vests " movement itself rose up against a planned fuel price hike , and while Villani has condemned the violence in the past , he has also acknowledged that the new carbon tax should have been paired with more redistributive measures , and its revenues should have been earmarked only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidacy for the Paris mayoral elections at a brasserie in the French capital in September 2019 <p> CHRISTOPHE ARCHAMBAULT/AFP via Getty Images <h> Read next <h> Fintech needs to ignore the VC goldrush and start making profit <p> ByRishi Khosla <p> All this -- repudiation of the traditional left-right divide , pragmatism , a larger role for the expertise coming from the civil society -- puts Villani 's approach in line with " Macronism " , or at least with what Macronism used to be . During his 2017 campaign , the soon-to-be French President successfully presented his movement as a breath of fresh air , a tidal wave that would shake up the old establishment . Villani jumped on board , becoming one of the most prominent examples of the supposed renewal of the political class . The campaign for Mayor of Paris , however , has brought the rapport with Macron to an end . After a LREM committee opted for Benjamin Griveaux as the party 's official candidate for Mayor , last July , Villani refused to withdraw from the race , launching an independent bid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expelled from the party . <p> Many observers agree that since the 2017 election , Macron 's centrist project has moved to the right . But according to Luc Rouban , a political scientist from Sciences Po university in Paris , the main reason behind Villani 's departure has more to do with the power dynamics within the majority . LREM , which at first was seen by many as a horizontal movement founded on participation and internal democracy , quickly became " very authoritarian and hierarchical , " he says . This generated tensions as early as 2018 , when " some of the LREM MPs started protesting against this authority coming from the top , namely from the government . " In this context " Villani distanced himself from the party machinery , to organise on the local level a form of modern democracy , participative and high-tech . " <p> This endeavour 's fortunes will depend on what people think of the candidate 's background , which in France 's political landscape is quite unique . In France , " scientists often become advisors to politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rouban . " One of them running for an elected office as important as Mayor of Paris , that 's really something new . " <p> To some voters , Villani 's profile is a great asset . That 's the general opinion among his supporters gathered for a campaign event at a cosy restaurant in Paris 's 18th district , in mid-February . <p> " I find him authentic , " says Clo ? , a 29-year-old real estate agent . In 2017 she voted for Macron , now she is almost sure that she will go for Villani . His being a scientist " is important , because it means a different way of thinking , a different kind of intelligence than someone who has studied politics , for example . " Claude , a retired engineer , has a similar view : " For me , Villani 's scientific experience is his most important quality , " he says , convinced that the mathematician is the right man to revitalise the City of Light 's cultural and intellectual splendour : " For too long Paris has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that behind .

He says that his independent bid will shield him from partisan games and allow him to get things done , but the day-to-day business of running a city like Paris may prove challenging for an utter outsider . " You have to be diplomatic , negotiate , forge alliances and therefore accept ideas a long way from yours , " says Rouban : " It 's a different job , it is n't simply an equation . In politics , equations never work . " <p> On top of that , in times of rampant populism and hostility towards the elites , does n't Villani also risk being flat-out rebuffed by a sizeable chunk of the electorate ? " Populism goes hand in hand with the rejection of science and scientific rationality in the name of ' common sense ' , " Rouban continues . Villani 's profile is a double-edged sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also a potential weakness when it comes to the working class . The good news for Villani is that he hardly needs the latter : " In Paris there 's a concentration of residents from the higher , better-educated echelons of society , " Rouban notes . Due to the sky-rocketing real estate prices many poor " migrated to the suburbs a long time ago . " <p> Not everybody is impressed by the scientist 's idea to trust technology and mathematical models -- ? -la-Cummings -- to solve the city 's problems . " What matters is being in touch with the people , " said Martinho , a binman who recognised Villani in the street and had a brief exchange with him during one of the candidate 's visits to the North of the capital : " Sure , you have to consider the technical side of things , but also the reality on the ground , the human side . " ( Martinho does not live in Paris proper and wo n't be able to vote in the mayoral election . ) <p> Generally speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of people -- including those whose background could n't be farther from his . This talent was on full display , for example , at the International Agricultural Show . Every year , hundreds of exhibitors from France and beyond flock to this major Parisian fair to showcase their culinary products , wines and livestock to a large public hunting for free tastings and day-drinking opportunities . This is also a much-awaited chance for French politicians to flaunt their **33;515;TOOLONG skills , and Villani was no exception : he met with farmers , was asked to take selfies , stepped onto patches of straw to pat all sorts of bovines . And whether or not they knew who he was , the workers he chatted with seemed to appreciate this waistcoat-wearing man , who stopped by to inquire about their businesses and their home regions . <p> Yet there 's a big difference between vaguely liking someone and voting for them , and C ? dric Villani 's campaign is in trouble in the polls . Despite his efforts to bring more complexity to the table , the run-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the streets ' dirtiness and crime ; security in particular has polarised the debate along a very traditional left-right divide , which the mathematician , with his compromise proposal of a new local police force only partially armed with guns , does n't seem to have managed to bridge . <h> Read next <h> Why is everyone talking about Universal Basic Income ? <p> ByWill Bedingfield <p> But even if the chances of Villani becoming Mayor of Paris are minimal , his efforts wo n't necessarily be wasted . The complex , two-round election system in the French capital leaves plenty of room for last-minute coalition talks ahead of the runoff . As the frontrunners frantically seek to expand their support , smaller fish often wind up having disproportionate leverage . Villani has n't unveiled his strategy , but he is already being courted left and right . <p> " Together , my dear friends , we are going to turn the City of Light back on !

@@41828141 <h> How mathematical models attempt to predict the spread of disease <p> Almost 100 years ago , two Scots developed an apparently simple mathematical model to explain and predict the spread of viruses ( via Getty Images ) <p> The various pronouncements on coronavirus are a source of puzzlement to many . <p> On the one hand there are lurid predictions of millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths . On the other , while the actual numbers are growing , they seem tiny so far compared to the scale of the predictions . <p> Almost 100 years ago , two Scots , Anderson McKendrick and William Kermack , developed an apparently simple mathematical model to explain and predict the spread of viruses . This abstract model remains the basis of our modern understanding . It gives insights not just into the spread of diseases , but how things like fake news disseminate on the internet . <p> These economists proposed that people at any point in time are in one of three conceptual states . <p> The first defines those who are susceptible to any particular virus . For example , a certain type of person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not clear yet who is susceptible to Covid-19 . It seems to be affecting most demographic groups , but the World Health Organisation pondered last week that children might not be susceptible , for example . <p> The next category is those who are infected , which is straightforward enough . The final one is " recovered " . This could mean genuinely recovered , or actually dead -- at any rate , no longer susceptible . <p> Kermack and McKendrick set up three non-linear differential equations to describe how a virus might spread . Their apparent simplicity disguises a fiendish complexity . <p> From the names of the categories , it is known as the SIR model -- susceptible , infected , recovered . <p> A major uncertainty is whether to use this model or its SIS variant . Here , the final " S " also means susceptible . The SIS model means that people can get re-infected . The common cold is a good example . <p> The key part of the system is determining how many susceptibles any given infected person passes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this depends on how much the susceptibles and infected intermingle ( hence the drastic quarantines in China and Italy ) , the probability of catching the virus from a single contact , and the length of time someone is infected . <p> Basically , a virus will spread if a sufferer infects on average more than one susceptible . The current number for Covid-19 seems to be between two and three . <p> Typically , solutions of the model start with a very small number of cases relative to the size of the population . Then , very quickly , these accelerate dramatically . <p> Imagine a city of one million . People are only infectious for one day and infect two susceptibles . Someone catches the disease . There are only 128 cases at the end of the first week .

Other Potential Options to Excuse Contractual Performance Under US Law in the Face of COVID-19 <p> The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) and the varied government responses thereto have caused significant disruption to commercial operations and relationships . Some companies are considering whether the outbreak constitutes a force majeure event , but what if your contract does not include an express force majeure clause ? Before concluding that there is nothing that you or your contracting counterparty can do when facing disruptions as a result of COVID-19 ( or a crisis event generally ) , take a close look at the applicable law . There may be other options available under US law to excuse non-performance of a commercial contract in the face of a crisis , though it may be difficult to prevail under these alternative theories . <p> **25;1633;TOOLONG <p> Most US states recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossibility , " which may be invoked to excuse contract performance under certain circumstances . But parties choosing to invoke these common law doctrines often face significant hurdles . <p> For example , New York law limits the doctrine of impossibility to cases where ( 1 ) performance is " objectively " impossible due to the " destruction of the means of performance " by an act of God , force majeure event , or the subsequent passage of law rendering performance illegal or ( 2 ) there has been a change in circumstances so fundamental that it would be unjust or contrary to public policy to hold the parties to their original agreement . Generally speaking , " impossibility " could include , for example , the death or incapacity of a person necessary to performance or the destruction of an irreplaceable good or component . Impossibility generally would not include events like the destruction of commutable inventory or inconvenience . <p> Texas law -- like New York 's -- recognizes the doctrine of impossibility of performance . Texas courts will excuse a party 's performance where , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without his fault by the occurrence of an event . " The doctrine requires that non-occurrence of the event was a basic assumption on which the contract was made . In other words , events that were foreseeable at the time of contract formation , and part of the mutual intent of the parties , will not excuse non-performance . Using impossibility as a basis to excuse contract obligations can be challenging , because Texas courts have interpreted " impossibility " to require more than mere difficulty , hardship , or expense . And Texas courts require the party invoking impossibility to have made " reasonable efforts to surmount the obstacle to performance , " such as by providing cover . <p> Companies that have included a force majeure provisions in their contract should be aware that -- in jurisdictions like New York and Texas , which construe force majeure clauses narrowly -- the inclusion of a force majeure clause may preclude them from later asserting " impossibility . " Courts in New York and Texas have prevented parties from invoking " impossibility " where a force majeure event was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- but was not -- enumerated in the force majeure clause . In these jurisdictions , a court will only release the parties from their contractual obligations due to events that were " unanticipated " at the time the contract was formed , meaning that the event could not have been foreseen or guarded against in the force majeure clause . For this reason , it is crucial that force majeure provisions are carefully drafted , and the rights and obligations of both parties specifically defined therein . <p> California has expanded its common law impossibility defense to include impracticability . The doctrine of impracticability -- which , as one might expect , is easier to demonstrate than impossibility -- excuses performance where a party can demonstrate that performance may be so difficult and expensive that it becomes " impracticable , " though technically possible . Circumstances rendering performance more difficult or costly than the parties originally contemplated do not necessarily rise to the level of impracticability , however . Impracticability requires a showing that performance can only be accomplished with " excessive and unreasonable " cost , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like California and New York , also recognize a defense based on " frustration of purpose , " which releases a party from its contractual obligations where a supervening event substantially obviates/frustrates the purpose underlying the contract . In other words , this doctrine applies when " the frustrated purpose is so completely the basis of the contract that , as both parties understood , without it , the transaction would have made little sense . " Like impossibility , this requires that the frustration resulted from a change in circumstances that was unforeseeable and beyond the parties ' control . The key distinction is that the frustration must be mutual ; that is , the change in circumstances must have rendered the contract pointless for both parties . <p> It should be noted that , while Texas recognizes " frustration of purpose , " it is in name only . At common law , the doctrine is functionally equivalent to the " impossibility " defense . <p> The United Nations Convention on Contracts <p> In signatory nations , the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial goods between parties in different countries ( that is , unless the parties have expressly waived its applicability ) . Article 79 of the CISG may excuse nonperformance that results from an unforeseeable impediment beyond a party 's control that it could not have overcome . <p> The Uniform Commercial Code <p> Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) may also excuse performance where performance is rendered impracticable by either ( 1 ) the occurrence of an event " the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made " or ( 2 ) good faith compliance with foreign or domestic government regulation . See , e.g. , N.Y . U.C.C. ? 2-615(a) ; Cal . Com . Code ? 2615 ; Tex . Bus . &amp; Com . Code ? 2.615 ; Fla . Stat. ? 672.615 .

Instead , impracticability will excuse performance where performance is theoretically possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that the contract 's terms may alter the UCC 's applicability and that the mutual intent of the parties at the time of contracting controls . For example , the parties may provide in their force majeure clause that performance will be excused on a showing of " hardship , " or a standard that is less exacting than the " unreasonable " or " prohibitive " expense required by the UCC . Furthermore , Article 2 only governs contracts for the sale of goods . Thus , unless state law otherwise recognizes impracticability as a defense at common law ( e.g. , in California ) , performance of contracts for services or real property will not be excused based on commercial impracticability . <p> Material Adverse Change/Effect <p> Some contracts expressly allocate risk based on events that could result in a material adverse change ( MAC ) or material adverse effect ( MAE ) on the business or its prospects . The occurrence of a MAC or MAE may give the invoking party the right to avoid performance or even terminate the contract . Examples of MACs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a ) breach or default under a related contract ; ( b ) threatened litigation or arbitration ; or ( c ) situations that would materially impact the operations or financial performance of the company . With respect to COVID-19 or another crisis event , a MAC or MAE might include travel restrictions , supply chain disruptions or shortages , lock-downs and quarantines , all of which have the potential to materially affect a company 's commercial operations or long-term prospects , at least while the crisis is ongoing . <p> Companies should take proactive steps to mitigate their risk triggered by a potential force majeure event , even if their commercial agreements lack an express force majeure clause . As noted above , the existence ( or absence ) of a force majeure clause is not the end of the inquiry . As explained here and in prior posts , there may be other avenues for a company ( or its counterparty ) to seek relief from contractual obligations due to a force majeure event , including remedies at common law , under the CISG or Article 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force majeure provision , consider taking the following steps : <p> 1 . Carefully review the options available under the US state law governing your contract . Evaluate whether the non-performing party will have to demonstrate impossibility of performance or mere impracticability . Likewise , if frustration is a recognized doctrine in the relevant state , consider whether the purpose underlying the agreement has been frustrated for both parties . <p> 2 . For companies considering invoking common law " impossibility , " evaluate whether performance is objectively impossible . Can a party perform its contractual obligations or will performance merely be difficult or expensive ? There may be a valid impossibility defense if , for example , a person necessary to performance has died or become incapacitated or quarantined , or if performance has been rendered illegal by government containment procedures or other regulations . <p> 3 . If you are a supplier of goods , consider your contingency plans in the event that your supply chain is disrupted by COVID-19 . Under the laws of most US states , you will be required to source goods from alternate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be costly . Be sure to weigh the economic impact of obtaining cover against the expense of defending a breach of contract claim . Additionally , consider whether the cost of obtaining cover is " unreasonable " enough to avail you of the " impracticability " defense under the UCC ( or potentially state common law ) . <p> 4 . Consider whether a party is seeking relief from a commercial contract for the sale of goods , or a contract for services or real property . If the former , the dispute is likely covered by the UCC , which may be less rigid than the common law . For international contracts for the sale of goods , evaluate whether the CISG applies and , if so , whether the crisis could be considered an unforeseeable event that can not be overcome . <p> 5 . Retain counsel to draft ( or at least review for you ) a force majeure clause to include in future contracts ( and in amendments to existing contracts , where possible ) . The force majeure language should specifically define the triggering force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The guidance is designed to facilitate the ability of companies to hold these important meetings , including through the use of technology at " virtual " meetings , while complying with the federal securities laws . <p> In this Alert , we summarize the staff 's guidance and the views of the proxy advisory firms and highlight other important considerations for any company that may be considering conducting a " virtual " annual meeting due to COVID-19 concerns . <p> SEC Staff Guidance <p> Changing the Date , Time , or Location of an Annual Meeting <p> The staff will take the position that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date , time , or location of its annual stockholder meeting due to difficulties arising from COVID-19 , and ( ii ) has already mailed and filed its definitive proxy materials can notify stockholders of the change without mailing additional soliciting materials or amending its proxy materials if the issuer : <p> issues a press release announcing the change in the date , time , or location ; <p> files the announcement as definitive additional soliciting material on EDGAR ; and <p> takes all reasonable steps necessary to inform other intermediaries in the proxy process and other relevant market participants ( such as any proxy service provider and the appropriate national securities exchanges ) of the change . <p> The SEC staff expects an issuer to take the above actions promptly after making a decision to change the date , time , or location of its annual meeting and sufficiently in advance of the meeting so as to timely alert the market . If an issuer has not yet mailed and filed its definitive proxy materials , the guidance states that the issuer should consider , based on its particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in meeting date , time , or location , whether to include disclosures in its proxy materials regarding the possibility of such changes due to COVID-19 . Issuers that have not yet filed a definitive proxy statement should take advantage of the opportunity to include the suggested disclosure of the possibility that the annual stockholder meeting will need to be changed to a virtual-only meeting . <p> " Virtual " Stockholder Meetings <p> The guidance acknowledges that an issuer 's ability to conduct a " virtual " stockholder meeting is governed by the law of an issuer 's state of incorporation and the issuer 's governing documents . <p> If an issuer plans to conduct a " virtual " or " hybrid " ( i.e. , an in-person meeting that also permits stockholder participation through electronic means ) meeting , the SEC staff expects the issuer will notify its stockholders , intermediaries in the proxy process , and other market participants of such plans in a timely manner and disclose clear directions on the logistical details of the " virtual " or " hybrid " meeting , including how stockholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such meeting . <p> If an issuer has not yet filed and delivered its definitive proxy materials , the guidance indicates that these disclosures should be included in the issuer 's definitive proxy statement and other soliciting materials . If the issuer has already filed and mailed its definitive proxy materials , however , then the issuer could file additional soliciting material with the SEC but would not need to mail the additional soliciting materials ( and in most cases would not need to mail new proxy cards ) solely for the purpose of switching to a " virtual " or " hybrid " meeting if the issuer follows the steps described above for announcing a change in the meeting date , time , or location . <p> Presentation of Shareholder Proposals <p> Exchange Act Rule 14a-8(h) requires shareholder proponents , or their representatives , to appear and present their shareholder proposals at the annual meeting . In light of the possible difficulties for shareholder proponents to attend annual meetings in person to present their proposals , the SEC staff is encouraging issuers , to the extent feasible under state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to present their proposals through alternative means , such as by phone , during the 2020 proxy season . <p> In addition , the guidance clarifies that , if a shareholder proponent or representative is not able to attend the annual meeting and present the proposal due to the inability to travel or other hardships related to COVID-19 , then the staff would consider this to be " good cause " under Rule 14a-8(h) , which would prevent an issuer from asserting Rule 14a-8(h) ( 3 ) as a basis to exclude a proposal submitted by the shareholder proponent for the next two annual meetings . <p> Proxy Advisory Firms ' Views <p> Recently , ISS and Glass Lewis have reportedly provided additional color on the use of virtual meetings during the 2020 proxy season in light of COVID-19.1 <p> ISS . Although ISS does not have a specific proxy voting policy on the use of virtual meetings , it has indicated that it will require an issuer that intends to conduct a virtual meeting due to COVID-19 concerns to provide full disclosure ensuring that the meeting will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISS expects virtual meetings to be transparent and organized in a manner that will allow a company 's stockholders to communicate with management , ask questions , and present shareholder proposals . The way in which companies manage virtual meetings this year will likely impact ISS 's policy position on virtual meetings in the future . <p> Glass Lewis . Glass Lewis 's existing voting policies generally recommend voting against governance committee members where the company plans to hold a virtual-only meeting and the company does not provide robust disclosure in its proxy statement that assures stockholders that they will be afforded the same rights and opportunities to participate as they would at an in-person meeting . Examples of such disclosure include : ( i ) addressing the ability of stockholders to ask questions during the meeting , including time guidelines , rules on permissible topics , and rules for how questions and comments will be recognized and disclosed to meeting participants ; ( ii ) procedures , if any , for posting appropriate questions received during the meeting and the company 's answers on the investor page of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to accessing the virtual meeting platform ; and ( iv ) procedures for accessing technical support to assist in the event of any difficulties accessing the virtual meeting . For issuers that have already filed their definitive proxy materials and later decide to switch to a virtual-only meeting , Glass Lewis indicated that it expects companies to disclose that the reason for the change is due to COVID-19 , provide information addressing how stockholders may access the virtual meeting , and confirm the ability for stockholders to ask questions during the meeting . <p> Other Considerations <p> An issuer that is considering a potential switch from an in-person meeting to a virtual meeting should contact a service provider about hosting its annual meeting if it has not already done so . Because of the large number of companies that are likely to explore virtual-only meetings during this proxy season and the relatively limited number of service providers who have experience hosting virtual-only meetings , issuers should reach out to the relevant service providers well in advance of making the decision to switch to a virtual-only meeting in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to delay the annual meeting . In addition , we understand that Broadridge is recommending that any issuer should make a final decision as to whether to hold a virtual meeting at least three weeks prior to the meeting date . <p> An issuer that determines to move forward with an in-person or hybrid meeting should continue to monitor public health developments , including any local regulations on holding gatherings given the risks posed by COVID-19 . <p> To view all formatting for this article ( eg , tables , footnotes ) , please access the original here . <p> " I am very pleased with the content of the Lexology newsfeeds .

@@41836341 <h> COVID-19 vs the common flu : Here 's how to tell them apart <p> The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) recently released a report about COVID-19 on the new territories that have reported cases of COVID-19 , but what was perhaps more interesting was the included Q&amp;A about the differences between COVID-19 and influenza or the common flu . While it is kinda difficult to make sense of all the medical jargon in WHO 's report , thankfully MIT Technology Review reporter Tanya Basu has written a great piece that breaks down the report . <p> As WHO has declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic , and our very own Malaysian government has issued a Movement Control order , it is important to educate ourselves better with the differences between the coronavirus and influenza . Here are the six main differences between these two viruses according to the WHO . <h> COVID-19 spreads slower than influenza <p> The speed of transmission between these two viruses is the key to differentiate them . There are two reasons to explain it . Firstly , the novel coronavirus 's serial interval ( time between the successive cases ) is around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a three-day gap between the cases . As coronavirus appears to take longer serial interval time , this means researchers are having hard time to identify and study the epidemiological links ( how diseases occur in different groups of people and why ) between cases . Serial intervals can serve as an important boundary to design infection prevention and control strategies ( IPC ) in epidemic transmission models . <p> Another important reason is the incubation period or the length of time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease . Coronavirus 's incubation period is range from one to 14 days , most commonly around five days while for a flu is only about 24 hours to three days . It is important to differentiate the incubation period between them because it will help determine the clues about the sources of an outbreak . <p> Although these two viruses are transmitted at different speeds , COVID-19 and influenza viruses spread in similar ways . They are both viruses that attack the respiratory system and could cause death . Moreover , both viruses spread through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hand hygiene , as well as cough etiquette is important actions in preventing the infection from spreading . <h> Someone with COVID-19 can spread the virus before showing symptoms <p> Unlike the flu , COVID-19 can spread without an infected person showing symptoms . This is because the virus in an infected person starts to shed , or reproduce virus progeny ( offspring ) , to the surrounding before that particular person shows any symptoms . A study in The Lancet showed that survivors continued to shed the coronavirus for around 20 days or until death . <p> This has made it completely different with influenza that sheds in the first or two days after symptoms have started . Most of the time , influenza will only shed for up to a week . This also suggests that coronavirus patients remain contagious for a longer time compared to patients with influenza . <h> More than one secondary infection <p> When you 've successfully battled a secondary infection for a flu , it is unlikely for you to contract the same infections twice . This is because the immune system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same virus . <p> However , there are higher risks for COVID-19 patients to experience more than one secondary infection . Researchers have estimated that COVID-19 patients have a higher reproductive number , between 2 and 2.5 , compared to the common influenza . A reproductive number is used to denote the average number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual . <p> But it is still difficult to make direct comparison between these two diseases due to context and time differences . For example , researchers find it difficult to get a clear comparison when infected patients -- who are struggling from COVID-19 -- are having other health conditions . <h> Adults have higher possibility passing the coronavirus <p> For influenza it is often passed from a child to another child through sneezing or coughing . However , it is suggested that adults are most likely be the actors in transmitting COVID-19 compared to children . Older people or people who have serious chronic medical conditions such as heart disease , diabetes or lung disease are also at higher risks of getting really sick if they are infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't get infected with COVID-19 . According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention , there is only one death in someone younger than 20 and no deaths among children below the age of 10 out of the 45,000 confirmed cases in China . But , CNN Health also reports that even though cases involving children typically would n't be as severe as adults , it does n't mean that their cases wo n't be serious too . <p> In the latest statistics from the Malaysian Health Ministry , there are currently 181,556 confirmed cases and 6,442 death cases across the globe .

@@41836541 <p> Dave Richards , Diane Coyle , Martin Smith , and Sam Warnerhighlight an important paradox in the British system of government : the centralised financial control exercised by the Treasury in an era of fragmentation within the governing process . They explain how this institutional problem can be understood . <p> Ahead of Boris Johnson 's recent cabinet reshuffle , most of the headlines wrongly predicted a Macmillan-style ' night of the long-knives ' . In the aftermath , most attention focused on the resignation of Sajid Javid as Chancellor of the Exchequer . This was widely reported as a power struggle between Number 10 ( personified by the PM 's Chief Advisor Dominic Cummings ) and the Treasury over who should control the broad thrust of government economic policy . <p> Harmony has appeared to prevail in the recent Budget of new Chancellor Rishi Sunak . But power struggles between Number 10 and the Treasury are nothing new : in 1964 , the new Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson created the ill-fated Department for Economic Affairs with responsibility for driving economic policy , so clipping the wings of the Treasury ; in 1989 , Margaret Thatcher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the pursuit of a subterfuge monetary policy by the Treasury in having sterling ' shadowing ' the German deutschemark . On this occasion , Lawson demanded the Prime Minister sack her own economic adviser , Sir Alan Walters , which , when she refused , led to Lawson 's resignation ; the New Labour Government notoriously saw an outbreak of ' TBGBs ' , as the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Chancellor Gordon Brown operated their own separate policy fiefdoms from their respective Whitehall power bases . <p> David Cameron and George Osborne learnt these lessons and forged a somewhat unusually co-operative and inter-dependent relationship . ( Boris Johnson has highlighted the effectiveness of the close ties during this period , as one driver behind his desire for shared political advisors between Number 10 and 11 . ) Nevertheless , Osborne has always been swift to remind those who cared to ask that he constantly counselled Cameron against holding a referendum on the EU . Fast-forward to the turbulence of the Theresa May years and normal service resumed as both the Prime Minister and her long-term Chancellor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter only remaining in office due to the government 's own perilous parliamentary arithmetic . <p> Given this history , it is no surprise that Johnson and Javid 's relationship ended as it did . But this on-going Whitehall psycho-drama played out between the personnel of these two great offices of state masks a deeper set of longer-term , embedded pathologies concerning the nature of UK economic-policy . For although the Prime Minister is primus inter pares , it is only the Treasury that has the bureaucratic and financial resources to exercise control across departments . Much of the conflict between Chancellors and Prime Ministers is a conflict between a large Treasury department overseeing detailed spending and a small Prime Minister 's office trying to influence through leadership . The Treasury is often the dominant department in government based on a hierarchical notion that centralising financial control is the most effective mechanism for containing public finances . But this dominance raises fundamental questions : how does the Treasury continue to exercise control in a fragmenting system ? And can governance be effective with a centralised Treasury and disaggregated policy delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation -- Public Expenditure Planning and Control in Complex Times -- we set out to explore a key paradox to emerge over recent decades in the British system of government : centralised financial control in an era of fragmentation within the governing process . Our lens shifts beyond the power-struggles at the heart of the Whitehall village to address a much wider institutional problem , namely that British government has fragmentation embedded in its DNA . The 1854 Northcote-Trevelyan Report , which enshrined the architectural arrangements of Whitehall , created a model of functionally distinct departments that meant they , rather than the central units of government -- No.10 , Cabinet Office , and the Treasury -- were resource-rich and powerful , developing the necessary expertise and organisational capability to command control of their policy domains . Ever since , there has been a need to overcome the pathology of departments acting in their own self-interest ( departmentalism ) rather than the wider interests of the government . Compounding this issue over the last 30 years has been a process of governance fragmentation -- agencification , marketisation , and devolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size and scale of their own power base conjoined to an increasingly outdated approach of the Treasury maintaining a highly centralised system of financial control at best ignores these wider sets of issues . <p> Putting the ' cummings and goings ' -- to coin a phrase -- of Whitehall to one side allows us to get to grips with the complex challenges associated with processes of fragmentation throughout policy networks . The project questions whether centralised forms of Treasury control of public expenditure remain fit-for-purpose in the twenty-first century , by addressing how such mechanisms have permeated through complex policy networks and in so doing shaped the perceptions and behaviours of public service providers . Starting in 1993 , we are navigating the public expenditure regimes of very different Conservative and Labour governments , covering periods of both fiscal expansion and prolonged austerity . We seek to ascertain whether an ' implementation gap ' exists regarding financial control at the centre and service delivery at the street level . At its heart , our project delves into the realities of Treasury adaptability to this fast-changing context , asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenges of tomorrow . By getting to grips with the complexities of the relationships between spending departments and delegated authorities , we hope to improve understanding of the effectiveness of spending control , why slippages and wastage occurs and what these processes mean for public service delivery . <p> Why is this important now ? Despite positive rhetoric from the centre , the UK economy is under strain as Brexit uncertainty continues to cast a disconcerting shadow . Even the most favourable projections about the short- to medium-term do not make for reassuring reading . The Office for Budgetary Responsibility 's 2019 Fiscal Risks report expresses concern at uncosted tax cuts and spending increases . What must it be thinking now ? The policy challenges associated with an ageing population , the cost pressures of health and social care and pensions must be at the forefront of Treasury officials ' minds . <p> In his much-anticipated maiden Budget , Rishi Sunak , Chancellor of the Exchequer , has spent big . The Treasury has embraced an era of historically low interest rates to provide the most extensive fiscal loosening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans will expand dramatically . Even an additional ? 30 billion cash injection to support the economy through coronavirus can not obscure the significance of this fiscal event . <p> Increased in public expenditure will be welcomed by a public consumed by ' austerity fatigue ' and fed up with deteriorating public services and regional inequalities . Talk of a regional base for the Treasury and re-working Green Book investment rules , confirmed in the Budget , must be more than rhetoric . Even with Sunak 's fiscal commitments , reversing the impact of austerity in any real sense , involving both levelling up the UK economy and halting the decline in public services , will require departmental spending far in excess of the government 's promises . Increases in capital spending for infrastructure projects is politically attractive , but in practice will require corresponding increases in current expenditure just to get projects off the ground . <p> Spending money is easy ; spending it effectively and efficiently is hard . The Treasury will need to wear many hats and be active and adaptable across many policy areas . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have failed to provide credible alternatives to the traditional , hierarchical character of expenditure control , despite best intentions . In a promising move , Sir Michael Barber 's 2017 report Delivering better outcomes for citizens pointed to the fact that successive governments have either focused on controlling public expenditure or delivering public service outcomes , not both . The Report 's recommendations led to Single Departmental Plans for planning spending being supplemented by the Treasury 's Public Value Framework . However , despite noble intentions to return value for money to the heart of the government 's spending plans , the Institute for Government has questioned whether it can adequately contend with the complexity of today 's public policy challenges , in part because it neglects the views of those outside of Whitehall . <p> Questions will remain about the sustainability of the public finances and the long-term credibility of existing mechanisms of control . The risks of wastage associated with such dramatic increases in public expenditure are real . We would argue that recent events simply add to our preliminary view that the Treasury is yet to adapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fragmented governance . Big political promises and an extraordinarily uncertain fiscal horizon dominated by Brexit and COVID-19 simply serve to highlight the challenges facing the Treasury . <p> Martin Smith is Anniversary Professor of Politics at the University of York . <p> Sam Warner , Researcher on Nuffield Foundation funded project Public Expenditure Planning and Control in Complex Times : A Study of Whitehall Departments ' Relationship to the Treasury ( 1993-Present ) , University of Manchester . <p> All articles posted on this blog give the views of the author(s) , and not the position of LSE British Politics and Policy , nor of the London School of Economics and Political Science.Featured image credit:Nick Kane on Unsplash . <p> We use cookies on this site to understand how you use our content , and to give you the best browsing experience .

But it does n't come close . <p> " The Government 's boast of the biggest investment since the 1950s is frankly a sleight of hand . It 's in fact only the biggest since they began their slash and burn assault on our services , economic infrastructure and living standards in 2010 . <p> " Having ruthlessly forced down the living standards and life chances of millions of our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cruel joke . <p> " The reality is that this is a Budget which has an admission of failure - an admission that austerity has been a failed experiment . It did n't solve our economic problems , but made them worse , that held back our own recovery and failed even in its own terms . " <p> Mr Corbyn added : " Today 's measures go nowhere near reversing the damage that has been done to our country .

They may now be able to better manage their financial resources during any downturn in work , or reduction in staff numbers . " <p> In advice issued last week , Tom advised local businesses of their responsibility to pay employees who needed to work from home , had to self-isolate or were struck by the virus . <p> 13:49 <h> Budget finished after just over an hour <p> So , those are the major points . and , after one hour and three minutes , Chancellor Rishi Sunak has finished delivering his first Budget . <p> 13:43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mr Sunak said : " The OBR have said that today 's Budget will be the largest sustained fiscal boost for 30 years . <p> " Next year , day-to-day departmental spending will grow at the fastest rate in 15 years . <p> " Over the spending review period , its set to grow at the fastest rate since 2004 .

This means it will apply to digital publications and audiobooks as well as printed material . <p> 13:34 <h> Carbon capture and ' a forest larger than Birmingham ' <p> The Chancellor has announced more environmental measures including carbon capture and planting thousands of trees .

Among the roads named for improvements is the A46 . <p> 13:23 <h> Bid to move civil servants outside London <p> Winning over the North was , as we all know , a big part of the Tories ' election landslide .

" <p> 13:09KEY EVENT <h> The big freeze ! <p> The Budget staples of beer , wine , cider and spirits duty as well as the fuel duty are easy to report this time . They 're all frozen . This will be the tenth year in a row fuel duty has n't changed . <h> Coronavirus response worth ? 7bn <p> When it 's all added up , the Chancellor says the overall coronavirus measures will be worth ? 7bn . <p> This will , once other measures are taken into account , amount to a ? 30bn " fiscal stimulus " he says . <p> 12:55KEY EVENT <h> Business rates to be scrapped for small shops and venues this year <p> The chancellor is scrapping business rates for small firms . <p> He said : " Our manifesto promised that for shops , cinemas , restaurants and music venues ... with a rateable value of less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retail discount to 50% . <p> " Today I can go further , and take the exceptional step , for this coming year , of abolishing their business rates altogether . " <p> Mr Sunak has also promised a ? 3,000 cash grant per business for any firm that is currently eligible for the small business rates relief . <p> He said : " This is a ? 2bn cash injection direct to 700,000 of our smallest businesses .

" <p> He repeats suggestions up to a fifth of the working population could be off sick at the same time , causing severe disruption . <p> 12:39 <h> Virus not the only challenge <p> The Chancellor says the virus is the key challenge facing the country at the moment , but it is n't the only one . He adds : " We 've just had an election where people voted for change " . <p> He says it will be " security today - prosperity tomorrow " . <p> 12:38 <h> Budget begins with coronavirus statement <p> Chancellor Rishi Sunak has started his Budget statement talking about Coronavirus . <p> He said : " I know how worried people are . Worried about their health , the health of their loved ones , their jobs , their income , their financial security .

Rather than wearing masks to prevent the flu , Americans tend to use other methods . <p> Harvard School of Public Health polls in May 2009 showed that when the swine flu pandemic happened , 67 percent of respondents washed their hands or used hand sanitizer more frequently , 55 percent made preparations to stay at home if they or their family member were sick and 35 percent took steps to avoid being near someone with flu-like symptoms .

" So masks always felt like an accessory and not a way to manage the spread of an infection . " <p> For Covid-19 , while Hong Kong experts are stressing the necessity of masks in protection , the CDC says the opposite , writing on its website that " no recommendation can be made at this time for mask use in the community by asymptomatic persons .

Only 43% of EPF members opted for the three-percentage-point reduced contribution rate of 8% in 2009 and 45% opted for it in 2010 , but the actual amount released to boost consumption is unknown . About 50% of EPF members reportedly opted for the reduced contribution rate of 8% from March 2016 to December 2017 . <p> An updated version of the stimulus package will be presented in one to two weeks ' time , Muhyiddin said on March 11 . <p> Recalibrate Budget 2020 and stimulus <p> With global stock markets witnessing another Black Monday on March 9 and further selling last week amid the Covid-19 pandemic and surprise oil price rout , there is indeed a need for Malaysia to reassess not only the adequacy of the stimulus measures but also Budget 2020 , which was prepared with Brent prices at US$62 a barrel . <p> Brent was below US$33 a barrel at the time of writing , which translates into a shortfall of about RM9 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall being equivalent to RM300 million . <p> The reality could be harsher , even though normal dividends from Petroliam Nasional Bhd ( Petronas ) -- which formed 37% to 57% of oil-related revenue and 7% to 16% of total federal government revenue in the past decade -- remain intact . <p> Petroleum income tax ( PITA ) fell from RM27 billion in 2014 to RM11.6 billion in 2015 and RM8.4 billion in 2016 before recovering to RM11.8 billion in 2017 and RM20 billion in 2018 . PITA is estimated at RM17.9 billion in 2020 , same as 2019 . Export duties from petroleum also fell from RM1.6 billion in 2014 to RM989 million in 2015 and RM673 million in 2016 before recovering to RM1.5 billion in 2018 . It is estimated at RM1.3 billion for this year . <p> There is also the possibility of lower tax receipts due to weaker economic conditions . Targets for corporate and individual tax collections are at a record high , despite GDP forecast for 2020 being revised lower from 4.8% of GDP to 3.2% to 4.2% of GDP on Feb 27 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) and crude palm oil ( CPO ) prices may deal another blow to exports and the economy . <p> A saving grace here is that only RM438.8 million ( RM319.2 million for RON 95 and RM119.6 million for diesel ) of the RM2.2 billion allocation for fuel subsidies has been utilised to date , leaving RM1.76 billion that can be redirected for other uses , should the blanket subsidy be replaced with a targeted mechanism . <p> Deft recalibration of Budget 2020 is necessary , and should preferably not see the government forced to cut necessary development expenditure just to pay the usual operating bills and , worse , mere populist spending . <p> Reduced spending by the government may further dampen consumer and investor sentiments , shaken by uncertainties clouding the economy and job market . Conversely , clear communication and cleverly targeted fiscal spending will demonstrate strong policy response that is necessary to shore up confidence . <p> When Budget 2016 was revised , the Brent price assumption was US$30 to US$35 a barrel , down from US$48 , and was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- price levels that a recalibrated Budget 2020 should reflect . Malaysia also revised Budget 2015 to reflect a much lower oil price assumption of US$55 a barrel versus US$100 when it was tabled in October 2014 . <p> Money , money , money <p> Even with the overnight policy rate ( OPR ) at 2.5% after three cuts in the past nine months , Bank Negara Malaysia still has room for further monetary stimulus with inflation likely to remain low this year from low fuel prices , possibly even lower than last year 's CPI reading of 0.7% . In a March 9 note , CGS-CIMB Research economists cut their 2020 inflation forecast from 1.9% to 0.6% after revising downwards their Brent price assumption from US$63 a barrel to US$48 , and by extension , its estimate of RON 95 and diesel retail prices . <p> The consensus among economists is for more monetary easing , given the government 's limited fiscal room , with the budget deficit already at 3.4% even before oil prices dipped . <p> " At a time when fiscal stimulus is sorely needed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the slump in oil prices ... While successive Malaysian governments have been attempting to reduce the dependence of government revenue on oil and gas receipts , the fact of the matter is that -- in the absence of concrete revenue streams such as GST -- it had been an uphill struggle . It was all well and good when oil prices were steady and better still when they were climbing , but a lot less so when they are plunging , " says OCBC 's Wiranto , who expects another 25-basis point OPR cut to 2.25% on May 5 . <p> " A lot , however , will hinge on whether the global market sentiment , especially on the currency front , is stable enough in the next two months . " <p> A 1% change in the exchange rate will impact the overall CPI by 0.337% -- higher than the 0.112% impact from a 1% change in crude oil prices , 0.094% impact from a 1% change in the external debt/export ratio and 0.073% impact from a 1% change in indirect tax per capita , according to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 report . <p> Calling GST " too hot a political potato to touch anytime soon " , Wiranto reckons that policymakers will have their hands full finding ways to stimulate the economy and " working out a more sustainable revenue source than the fickle petroleum " . <p> " At most , the fiscal deficit can be pushed to 3.6% to 3.8% of GDP , depending on the severity of the global situation , before the ratings agencies baulk , " he says . <p> Pushing the fiscal deficit from 3.4% to 3.8% will translate into an additional RM6 billion , a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows -- almost double the RM3.5 billion fiscal outlay for the Covid-19 stimulus package but far short of the RM67 billion stimulus package ( RM7 billion in 2008 and RM60 billion in 2009 ) to counter the effects of the global financial crisis . <p> The second stimulus package in 2009 , which accounted for 9% of GDP back then and spanned two years , included a RM15 billion fiscal injection , RM25 billion in guarantee funds , RM10 billion for equity investments , RM7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentives . Malaysia 's budget deficit rose from 4.8% of GDP in 2008 to 7% in 2009 , the year the country recorded negative growth . <p> A 9% boost to GDP today will require about RM140 billion , with RM60 billion translating into about 3.8% of GDP -- still sizeable . <p> As it is , dividends from Petronas are pencilled in at RM24 billion for 2020 , the same as 2019 , excluding the RM30 billion special dividend to repay the RM37 billion in owed tax refunds . Petronas had RM622 billion assets and RM82 billion net cash as at end-2019 . <p> S&amp;P Global Ratings may assess a weaker stand-alone credit profile if Petronas ' debt-to-Ebitda ratio exceeds one time and it generates substantial negative discretionary cash outflows with no prospect of improvement . " This could materialise if annual negative discretionary cash flows exceed RM40 billion per year for more than two years and would most likely occur if the company 's spending or dividend distributions are together substantially higher than the RM80 billion we anticipate , " S&amp;P said when affirming its rating on Petronas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule out the possibility of more dividends from Petronas , should there be a need for a second stimulus package that requires significant additional fiscal pump-priming by the government . <p> " This should only be in a scenario where risks are tilted towards a recession , meaning it is necessary to support the economy , " she says , noting that official forecasts do not currently flag recession risks , unlike Singapore where official forecasts actually consider the possibility of negative growth . <p> It remains to be seen if Malaysia will revise the 2020 GDP guidance of 3.2% to 4.2% , which is down from the previous forecast of 4.8% , but may not have accounted for Brent prices at US$30 a barrel . <p> Bank Negara 's forecast for the economy on March 25 , in conjunction with the release of its 2019 annual report , will be keenly watched . <p> While some countries in the West are struggling in their efforts to address the pandemic , there is hope that China may lead global recovery . Apple , which shuttered in China early last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42 stores on March 13 , albeit on reduced hours . <p> Last Thursday , China said the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country is over . <p> Investor confidence will likely grow when more Chinese firms , factories and retailers are back in business , without seeing any resurgence in the outbreak . Malaysia will be among the beneficiaries if China resumes its consumption of goods and services . A stronger economy where most people no longer complain about the high cost of living will likely be a prerequisite for GST to see a second chance , whoever runs the government .
@@41858841 <p> Singapore is edging towards its first full-year recession in nearly two decades as neighbouring Malaysia 's travel ban cuts off a key source of labour and the coronavirus pandemic hits the economy , firming the case for the central bank to loosen policy . <p> The Southeast Asian nation has been widely praised for its response to the outbreak , but spiking cases elsewhere are adding pressure on the small and open economy . It has already signalled a chance of a recession this year and cut its growth forecasts . <p> " Financial conditions have tightened considerably in recent weeks , and the lockdown being imposed by countries to contain the COVID-19 outbreak means a recession in Singapore can not be avoided , " said ANZ economist Khoon Goh . <p> Most economists have cemented their expectations for the Monetary Authority of Singapore to ease policy at its review scheduled for April , with some now even raising the possibility of the central bank stepping in early . <p> The MAS is likely to change the Singapore dollar 's pace of appreciation to a neutral " zero slope , " all nine economists in a Reuters survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy band in which the currency is allowed to trade , five said , a more drastic action taken a decade ago during the global financial crisis . <p> MAS manages policy through exchange rate settings , rather than through the conventional interest rates , letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed policy band . <p> Starting Wednesday , Malaysia is stopping citizens from travelling overseas and visitors from entering the country until March 31 to help stop the spread of the coronavirus . <p> That move is expected to hit Singapore businesses , which employ some 300,000 Malaysians who commute from across the Straits of Johor . <p> " It represents quite a big blow to services and SMEs ( small and medium enterprises ) , which rely on labour force from across the causeway , " said Prakash Sakpal , an economist with ING . <p> While Erman Tan , the head of a chemicals plant , says four of his Malaysian staff are staying back in Singapore for the duration of the ban , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expects disruption in raw material supply from the neighbouring country . <p> Singapore is also set to unveil a second economic package to help businesses and workers , adding to the stimulus announced in the budget last month , which an economist said would be " more effective " than monetary action in the near term . <p> " Fiscal policy is going to provide direct assistance to small businesses , " said Steve Cochrane at Moody 's Analytics . <p> Some small businesses in Singapore are looking for extra support from the government to help them keep staff and lower costs , such as a cut in foreign workers levies . <p> " Now is the time when every dollar means a lot , " said John Kong , chief executive of local building materials supplier M Metal . <p> Singapore on Tuesday reported 23 new cases of coronavirus , its biggest daily jump , taking its tally to 266 infections .

@@41859141 <h> Coronavirus to spark " severe " global recession <p> The coronavirus is having a severe effect on global economic activity and amidst considerable uncertainty we have attempted to gauge the impact and updated our forecasts . <p> We now expect to see the world economy contract this year by 3.1% , before rebounding by 7.2% in 2021 . <p> The forecast incorporates a severe recession in the first half of the year which , even with a rebound in the second half , means 2020 is set to be the worst year for activity since the 1930s . <p> Although there is considerable support from central banks and governments , the dramatic downturn reflects the effect of shutting down large parts of the economy as the authorities attempt to suppress the virus . <p> An indication of the magnitudes can already be seen in the latest data from China , where we saw falls of 20% in retail sales and 25% in fixed capital investment during the period when much of the economy was in lockdown . <p> These figures are consistent with the high frequency data and our China activity indicator says that the economy contracted during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different story , but these figures give an indication of what to expect elsewhere . <h> Severe contraction in global economic activity expected <p> Source : Schroder Economics Group , 19 March 2020 <p> Thankfully the number of new Covid-19 cases in China has levelled out , but we are at an earlier point on the curve in Europe and the US . <p> Our underlying assumption is that these regions go through a similar process of locking down and restricting population movements so as to suppress the spread of the virus . <p> This results in a significant hit to activity in Q2 in the US and Europe with falls in GDP of between 10 and 20% ( not annualised ) . <p> Such outcomes have rarely been seen in the post war economies where normal fluctuations in GDP are between 1% and 2% . <h> Policymakers to the rescue ? <p> We have factored in the recent moves in monetary and fiscal policy around the world and expectations of more to come . <p> We see these as a safety net to cushion the economy and limit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial system continues to provide liquidity to firms and households so they can withstand the impact of the collapse in activity on cash flow . <p> Otherwise a temporary hit will cause permanent damage to the supply side of the economy . If we see a widespread collapse of business there will be little left to support the recovery . <p> In this respect , lower interest rates are less important than measures to ensure banks have the confidence to lend rather than foreclose on borrowers , and liquidity continues in commercial paper and credit markets . <p> The Bank of England 's actions combined with government guarantees on loans and measures to ease cash flow such as the suspension of business rates all help in the UK . <p> More widespread use of fiscal policy , such as the Trump plan to give lower and middle income households $1000 each , would also be helpful to support consumption in the face of the inevitable increase in unemployment . <p> We would expect the measures taken to contain infection to be effective in the US and Europe and alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , the economy should experience a strong rebound as people go back to work in the third quarter . <p> The policy bazooka will then be fully felt as low interest rates , tax cuts and increased government spending continue . <p> Going into 2021 we would expect a modest tightening of monetary policy around the world as the global economy booms . <h> Risks remain <h> Coronavirus returns ? <p> Making forecasts in this environment is particularly uncertain as we are having to anticipate the evolution of a virus . <p> As has been made clear in recent work by Warwick McKibbin and Roshen Fernando at the National Bureau of Economic Research , there are a number of different scenarios which could play out with the number of deaths ranging up to 68 million depending on the spread of the virus . <p> Analysis from our Data Insights Unit also shows how different reinfection rates can create very different outcomes . <p> More immediately , the risk is that the virus returns after the restrictions are lifted . <p> The UK government 's original strategy was to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a " herd immunity " in the population . <p> Given the risks around that policy it has now been dropped and the UK is following the rest of Europe in closing schools and restricting movement . <p> The cost though is that the risk of the virus returning is greater and consequently the world economy faces the prospect of having to go back into quarantine later in the year . <p> The consequence would be another recession -- a double dip in activity .

" The measures will address business problems such as cash flow , business costs , and credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As for measures targeted towards families , DPM Heng said , " Many Singaporeans are concerned about how they will pay their bills and household expenses if their livelihoods are affected during this uncertain period ... We will put more cash in the hands of all families to help them cope . " Therefore , among the measures to support families are ( 1 ) helping with daily expenses , ( 2 ) strengthening the network of support and ( 3 ) offering greater flexibility on fees and loans . <p> In the Resilience Budget , an unemployment grant of S$800 per month over three months is eligible to unemployed low-and-middle-income workers from households whose per capita household income is less than S$3,100 per month . In 2019 , the average resident household size was 3.16 persons per household . With a threshold of S$3,100 , this suggests a total household income of S$9,300 . <p> Last year , there were 62.5 per cent of households with household incomes of not more than S$9,000 with the inclusion of CPF contributions . From this , there could be approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S$800 unemployment benefit lasting for three months . <p> Assuming each working parent earning an average of S$4,500 with household income of S$9,000 , the unemployment benefit of S$800 would only amount to 17 per cent of their salary even with CPF contributions . The average earning of S$4,500 is the approximate reported median wage of full-time residents in Singapore with CPF contributions included . From this , the unemployment benefit of S$800 is around two-thirds of the salary of an outsourced resident cleaner with the lowest pay of S$1,200 . <p> Therefore , the unemployment grant needs an increase . Based on a study by several researchers in Singapore , S$1,379 is the income needed for elderly aged 65 and above living in single households to have a basic standard of living . Similarly , elderly aged between 55 to 64 living in single households would need S$1,721 . <p> Those in the younger age groups would need higher amount for a basic standard of living . The proposed unemployment benefit covers only around 45 per cent to 60 per cent of the budget needed to have a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to note is that , for those who are currently on public assistance , such as ComCare Interim Assistance or ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance ( SMTA ) , they will not be eligible for the unemployment benefit . <p> For this unemployment benefit scheme , S$145 million will be allocated , on top of the Temporary Relief Fund and the ComCare scheme . If the unemployment benefit is bumped up to S$1,700 , the total required expenditure will rise to a sum of S$308 million , which is only S$163 million more . This increase will then provide sufficient cushion for those who become unemployed during this time . Also , higher amounts should go to those on public assistance . <p> Furthermore , another measure to support unemployed workers is wage subsidies . The Government has stated that it will help co-fund 25 per cent of the wages of local workers under the extended Jobs Support Scheme . The Government will also co-fund wages in the tourism and aviation sectors as well as the wages in the food services sector by 75 per cent and 50 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion will be utilised to aid more than 1.9 million local workers in the country . Should the total increase to S$30 billion , it will form another 6 per cent of GDP . <p> The present S$55 billion budget accounts for 11 per cent of GDP . Whether higher wage subsidies are required to safeguard wages and jobs of workers in the country , this is worthy question to be pondered upon . <h> Discussion about this post <p> No Result <p> View All Result <h> Democracy is best served by having an informed and involved citizenry that has access to a wide range of sources of news and views and an open and vibrant environment in which to share and to debate ideas and opinions .

Hospitals in Italy are under increased pressure as they battle to treat those who have contracted COVID-19 . The Italian government continues to enforce the nationwide lockdown measures to control the spread of COVID-19 . ( Photo by Antonio Masiello/Getty Images ) <p> As many readers may know , I am currently hospitalized in Madrid after having tested positive for COVID-19 . My recovery has been slow , but the prospects are encouraging . Although remaining isolated from my loved ones has been unpleasant , it is a relief that these hardships are befalling us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal to remain socially connected . More traditional pastimes -- listening to music , reading , and , indeed , writing -- have been a gift as well . <p> For many hours , I have relied upon a distinguished companion to endure this confinement : none other than Winston Churchill . I have always been fascinated by the wartime British prime minister , and these days I have been able to discover new details about his life , thanks to an extraordinary biography by the historian Andrew Roberts . <p> Churchill 's admirable resilience throughout World War II is an endless source of inspiration , particularly in times like these . His character and track record -- both undoubtedly complex -- remind us that heroism is compatible with imperfection , that presence of mind is compatible with contradiction , and that courage is compatible with hesitation . Characters like Churchill deserve to be recognized , which is not to say they should be uncritically glorified . <p> In the private wars that many of us are already waging against COVID-19 , and that many others will unfortunately have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " blood , toil , tears , and sweat " that Churchill spoke of in May 1940 . But we should also try to emulate his buoyant spirit . The virus reportedly alters some patients ' senses of smell and taste , but there is no reason why it should numb our sense of humor . <p> From a collective standpoint , it also makes sense to take a page out of Churchill 's book . In recent days , many world leaders have claimed that we are at war against the virus -- and , to some extent , they are right . As in any other war , resources need to mobilized , and a host of civic values -- such as duty , comradeship , and public service -- need to be promoted with renewed conviction . The outstanding health professionals who , in Spain and all over the world , are giving their absolute best to fight the virus and alleviate the suffering of the ill are an example to us all . <p> We are facing a crisis of historic proportions . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , it is certainly not a typical one . After all , today 's enemy is shared by all of humankind , and the mobilization of state resources must go hand in hand with the demobilization of most of the population . <p> It is important not to lose sight of these and other differences . Otherwise the war rhetoric could cloud our judgment , leaving us vulnerable to certain traps . To avoid these undesirable scenarios , allow me to ring a few alarm bells and raise a few caveats . <p> First , we must not mistake strong leadership -- which will certainly be needed in these dire circumstances -- for inflexible leadership . Our governments should be given enough wiggle room to tackle this emergency properly , but that should not be taken to mean carte blanche -- not now and not ever . <p> Ensuring maximal preservation of civil liberties and continuing to hold our leaders accountable is not just an ethical imperative ; it is also our best line of defense against threats like the one we face today . Doing so does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public debate , thus increasing our chances of identifying the most suitable responses . <p> Second , we must not mistake patriotic responsibility -- which no doubt will be needed and welcome -- for exclusive forms of nationalism . This is no time for scapegoating or succumbing to panic and liberating our worst instincts . The ongoing crisis will be resolved only through rationality , compassion , and mutual understanding , both within and beyond our borders . All avenues of international scientific and technological cooperation must be explored , and always in a spirit of solidarity , which today , more than ever , overlaps fully with our own interests . The key to overcoming the current crisis is to ensure that the global spread of best practices outpaces the global spread of the virus . <p> Last , we must ensure that the socioeconomic landscape that emerges from this metaphorical war is in no way akin to those left behind after a real one . Reconstruction efforts must , in other words , be conceived preventively rather than reactively , and the shock-absorbing machinery must start working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU member states alike need to commit to do whatever it takes in this respect , in order to rise to the challenge . Other multilateral organizations and fora will also be indispensable in designing an effective joint response . Looking further into the future , we will need to make sure not to forget the many virtues of globalization -- which of course requires careful reevaluation , but not outright rejection . <p> Over the coming weeks , much will be at stake collectively , and for some of us also individually . Today , uncertainty about what the post-pandemic world will look like is rife . But we do know it will be built upon the words and deeds we choose now . We would do well , therefore , to look the evil before us in the eye , while never losing sight of our own future and that of coming generations . <p> Humankind has overcome harder tests than this one , and the actions needed now are in no way equivalent to those undertaken during World War II .

( " Kirkland Lake Gold " or the " Company " ) ( TSX:KL ) ( NYSE:KL ) ( ASX:KLA ) today announced a number of initiatives designed to protect employees , their families and local communities from the COVID-19 virus . Included among the initiatives are the introduction of company-wide health and safety protocols , a temporary reduction in operations at the Detour Lake Mine , a remote operation with a large accommodation camp , until April 30 , 2020 , the suspension of non-essential work at all operations , as well as the suspension of all exploration activities across the Company . <p> In addition , the Company also announced today it will terminate the Automatic Share Purchase Plan ( " ASPP " ) effective March 23 , 2020 . The suspension reflects the Company 's commitment to maintaining financial strength during the current period of uncertainty related to the COVID-19 virus . The ASPP was launched on February 20 , 2020 in connection with the Company 's current normal course issuer bid ( " NCIB " ) to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods and other restrictions . The current NCIB remains in effect on the same terms and conditions as previously disclosed . Under the current NCIB , the Company can purchase up to 10.5 million additional common shares between now and its expiry on May 28 , 2020 . A total of 10.4 million common shares have been repurchased to date through the current NCIB , including 1.9 million shares through the ASPP . Except as set out in this press release , the Company is not aware of any material undisclosed information about its business or its securities . <p> COVID-19 Response Plan <p> At the present time there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at any of the Company 's operations or offices . In response to the health risks associated with COVID-19 , Kirkland Lake Gold has implemented a series of health and safety protocols on a company-wide basis . At the operational level , site-level controls currently in place and/or being introduced include medical screening of all individuals prior to entering site , enhanced cleaning and hygiene practices , social distancing of workers , increased reliance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , work from home policies and the suspension of all non-essential work at , and visits to , the Company 's mine sites . <p> Detour Lake Mine <p> Detour Lake Mine is a camp operation , located approximately 185 kilometres northeast of Cochrane , Ontario and 300 kilometres northeast of Timmins , Ontario . The camp at Detour Lake accommodates approximately 1,100 workers at any given time . To reduce risk of the COVID-19 virus , the Company will transition to reduced operations effective March 23 , 2020 . Continuing activities at the mine will include mill processing of reduced feed from the open pit and stockpiles , management of water levels during the spring run-off and environmental management activities . All personnel not essential for the performance of these activities will be required to leave or remain offsite until April 30 , 2020 . In addition , workers from remote First Nations communities and those along the James Bay coast , as well as employees requiring airline transportation to get to and from the minesite , will also be advised to remain off site until the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations , the Company will provide paid leave for 14 working days , the equivalent of a month of normal pay . <p> Approximately 300 workers are expected to remain on-site to perform the essential activities during reduced operations . In addition to the health and safety protocols set out above , a number of additional measures applicable to a camp operation have been implemented , including processes for the assessment , isolation and medical evacuation of employees , increased food and hygiene safety and a greater frequency of cleaning . <p> Tony Makuch , President and Chief Executive Officer of Kirkland Lake Gold , commented : " COVID-19 represents an unprecedented challenge for people , governments and businesses worldwide . While none of our employees have tested positive for COVID-19 , the actions we are taking represent our best judgement , based on what we know today , on how to responsibly protect our people from the pandemic . As always , the safety of our employees is our top priority . On a company-wide basis , we are introducing a series of health and safety protocols including medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other forms of social distancing . We are also discontinuing all non-essential work at our operations and suspending exploration activities across the Company . In the case of Detour , the increased risk represented by the remoteness of the mine and the camp environment requires a more extensive response . As a result , we are transitioning to reduced operations until April 30 , 2020 in order to minimize the number of people required at site . We will continue to produce , though at lower levels , and will ensure critical tasks are completed such as managing water during the spring run-off and ongoing environmental management . It is not possible at this time to estimate the impact of reduced operations on Detour Lake 's 2020 production . <p> " Turning to our NCIB , we have been very committed to buying back our shares through the NCIB , with a total of 10.4 million shares having been repurchased under the current plan to date for a total of $360 million ( C$483 million ) . Given current global events , we believe it is prudent to maintain as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very strong balance sheet with close to $500 million of cash and no debt . To preserve our financial strength , we have elected to discontinue the ASPP , through which we were repurchasing approximately 103,000 shares per day on an automatic basis , outside of our discretion . We retain the option to repurchase shares through the discretionary component of the NCIB and will consider any future repurchases in relation to evolving global developments .

Late in the evening on Thursday , March 26 , the DOL supplemented that guidance by adding twenty-three new " Frequently Asked Questions " ( numbers 15-37 ) . The DOL also issued a separate set of " Frequently Asked Questions " related to the notice posting requirements of the FFCRA . Collectively , the guidance is aimed at helping employees and employers understand their rights and responsibilities under the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act ( " FMLA Expansion Act " ) and Emergency Paid Sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FFCRA . <p> The DOL 's guidance was largely consistent with Kilpatrick Townsend 's prior interpretation available here . Below we highlight key new provisions from the DOL 's updated guidance : <p> Record Keeping . According to the DOL guidance , employers must require employees to provide documentation when they take paid sick leave under the EPSL Act and the FMLA Expansion Act . ( FAQs 15-16 ) . <p> EPSL Act Documentation . Under the EPSL Act , the DOL guidance states that employers " must require " employees to provide : ( 1 ) their name ; ( 2 ) the qualifying reason for requesting leave ; ( 3 ) a statement that the employee is unable to work , including telework , based on that reason ; and , ( 4 ) the date(s) for which the leave is requested . Additionally , documentation of the reason for the leave will also be necessary , which includes " the source of any quarantine or isolation order , or the name of the health care provider who has advised the employee to self-quarantine . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19 applicable to the employee or written documentation by a health care provider advising the employee to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19 . " <p> FMLA Expansion Act Documentation . Similarly , if an employee takes leave under the FMLA Expansion Act , employers " must require " employees to provide appropriate documentation , " just as employers would for conventional FMLA leave requests . " The DOL guidance states that this could include " a notice that has been posted on a government , school , or day care website , or published in a newspaper , or an email from an employee or official of the school , place of care , or child care provider . " The DOL further notes that " this requirement also applies when the first two weeks of unpaid leave run concurrently with paid sick leave taken for the same reason . " The DOL also notes ( in FAQ 16 ) that : " all existing certification requirements under the FMLA remain in effect if an employee is taking leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The DOL provides the example that , if an employee takes leave beyond the two weeks of emergency paid sick leave , because his/her medical condition for COVID-19-related reasons rises to the level of a serious health condition , the employee must continue to provide medical certifications under the FMLA as required by employer policy . <p> Without stating it explicitly , the DOL implies that this documentation will be required for employers to claim tax credits under the FFCRA . <p> Teleworking . In short , employees may only telework when the employer " permits or allows " the employee to do so ( FAQ 17 ) , and clarifies that an employee is unable to work or telework when the employer has work for the employee to perform , but , because of the COVID-19 qualifying reasons in the Act , the employee can not perform the work either " under normal circumstances " at the " normal worksite " or " by means of telework " ( FAQ 18 ) . The guidance is clear that if an employee becomes unable to work or telework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will then become eligible for leave under the EPSL Act and/or the FMLA Expansion Act ( FAQ 19 ) . <p> Intermittent Leave While Teleworking . Intermittent leave will be allowed while an employee teleworks , if the " employer allows it " and the employee is " unable to telework his/her normal schedule of hours due to one of the qualifying reasons " in the EPSL Act and/or FMLA Expansion Act . The DOL says that employees and employers " may agree " to allow employees to take intermittent EPSL or leave under the FMLA Expansion Act . The DOL states that employees " may take intermittent leave in any increment " so long as the employer and employee agree . Further , the DOL " encourages employers and employees to collaborate to achieve flexibility and meet mutual needs , and the Department is supportive of such voluntary arrangements that combine telework and intermittent leave . " ( FAQ 20 ) . Notably , this differs from previous analysis of the Act 's text , because the EPSL Act explicitly states that paid sick time " shall cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the termination of the need for paid sick time " under the qualifying reasons . <p> Intermittent Leave while Working at " Usual " Worksite . The DOL states that intermittent leave for non-teleworking employees will depend on ( 1 ) why the employee is taking the leave and ( 2 ) whether the employer agrees . ( FAQ 21 ) . Unless an employee is teleworking , " paid sick leave for qualifying reasons related to COVID-19 must be taken in full-day increments " and " can not be taken intermittently " when the leave is taken for COVID-19 related reasons due to a Federal , State , or local quarantine or isolation order ; the employee has been advised to self-quarantine ; the employee is experiencing symptoms and is seeking medical care ; the employee is caring for someone subject to a quarantine or isolation order , or who has been advised to self-quarantine ; and/or , the employee is experiencing other " substantially similar conditions specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services . " The DOL is clear that , once an employee starts taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teleworking -- the employee must continue to take paid sick leave each day until ( 1 ) the available leave is exhausted ; or , ( 2 ) the employee no longer has a qualifying reason to take the leave . Notably , the DOL leaves open that an employee may use the pool of available leave open to take at a later date , so long as they take the leave for a qualifying reason before it expires on December 31 , 2020 . Finally , because the DOL " encourages employers and employees to collaborate to achieve maximum flexibility , " it is , therefore , " supportive of " voluntary agreements that allow employees to take intermittent leave in order to provide qualifying care for a minor child under the Act . The DOL is explicit , however , that this leave may only be taken intermittently for non-teleworking employees when the employer gives its permission . ( FAQ 22 ) . <p> Leave is Not Retroactive . If an employer closes or sends employees home prior to the Act 's effective date of April 1 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is required to close pursuant to a Federal , State , or local directive -- employees are not entitled to paid sick leave or the leave allotted under the FMLA Expansion Act . However , these employees may be eligible for unemployment benefits .

There is still no effective federal/state coordination . <p> It is humbling that an ultra-tiny packet of RNA could wreck such havoc on human civilization . <p> Beyond the social upheavals and economic devastations , this Covid-19 virus also inflicts consequential but underappreciated impact on the individual psyche , both the healthy as well as the infected . Despite advances in neuro- and behavioral sciences , there is still a huge void in understanding this facet of the pandemic . <p> This is where we need our spiritual and religious leaders . Just as there are no atheists in a foxhole , likewise there are no non-believers in a pandemic . We need and depend on a higher power to reassure us , and each other to protect and sustain us . <p> In this regard , I am heartened that my Imam Ilyas had recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our prayers at home , he advised . <p> Singapore 's Mufti too did likewise .

It encourages its followers to maintain regular communications with their loved ones via phones , Facetime , and other platforms . It offers tips on keeping the conversations hopeful so as not to burden others with your anxieties . Other suggestions include reading together passages from the Holy Book , reviewing family pictures , and sharing stories . <p> Many religious leaders neglect this crucial role of guidance . Malaysian ulama , all on state payroll , instead engage in sterile sermons . We should fear Allah more than Covid-19 , they bellowed , and that the virus is Allah 's punishment ! <p> Words , more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those pronouncements resulted in Malaysia 's second and much more devastating surge in new cases . <p> Imagine the lives saved , costs not incurred , and families spared needless grief had that Sri Petaling Tabligh religious gathering been cancelled . Nor has that crucial lesson been learned . There was a much bigger festival later in Indonesia , a nation ill equipped to handle the inevitable spike in new infections . <p> Those ulama have yet to own up to their accountability for these preventable tragedies . <p> Religious leaders have minimal knowledge on medical and public health issues ; they should not pretend otherwise . Instead they should endorse those public health measures , using their religious knowledge to buttress the arguments . Likewise , Malaysian professionals should not abrogate their responsibilities by giving those bureaucrat-ulama veto powers . <p> Be guided by our prophetic traditions .

In the current context , first observe social distancing and wash your hands often , only then pray and make du'a . <p> On another front , imagine the anguish of bereaved families when they could not administer the traditional funeral rites , as with washing the bodies . Or worse , when they breach hygienic principles , thus endangering themselves and others . <p> Indonesia 's Imam Das'ad Latif advice is instructive . He likened the pandemic to war , with the victims syahid ( martyrs ) , destined for Allah 's special slot in Heaven .

Of greater significance is that those consequences are transmitted to the next generation and beyond , as indicated by studies on victims of mass starvation in China during Mao , and in the Netherlands during the WWII Nazi blockade . <p> In short , what my Imam Ilyas , Singapore 's Mufti Nazirudin , and Indonesia 's Imam Das'ad Latif are doing is harness their spiritual leadership to calm and guide their followers .

We can not risk turning Houses of Allah into Houses of Pestilence . <p> Religion is to guide and protect , not lead us into danger . Islam is a set of universal principles to guide us to and keep us on the straight path . It is not a compilation of rigid rituals to be mindlessly performed .

The virus is unlikely to kill enough U.S. birds to offset the drop in overseas demand due to trade bans . <p> While the H5N2 strain poses no threat to humans , according to the USDA , it is deadly to poultry . Avian flu can spread rapidly through a flock , killing birds in as little as 24 hours . <p> The USA Poultry &amp; Egg Export Council , an industry group , said it expected 30 to 40 additional countries to impose new trade restrictions on U.S. poultry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be " more product on the domestic market and that will depress prices , " said Jessica Sampson , agricultural economist at Livestock Marketing Information Center . <p> The United States exports about 20 percent of the chicken it produces and about 14 percent of the turkey produced , according to the center . <p> Last year , China and South Korea accounted for about $428.5 million in export sales of poultry meat and products , according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data . <p> With the export market already hit by the strong dollar , " we do n't need anything else that would make those exports any softer , " said Mike Cockrell , chief financial officer for Sanderson Farms . <p> Shares in Sanderson , Tyson and Pilgrim 's Pride were flat to lower on Thursday . <p> So far , viral strains of bird flu have been identified mostly in wild birds and commercial turkey farms , predominantly west of the Rocky Mountains .

The poultry sector fears the virus could spread through the much bigger domestic chicken industry .

In January , Tyson reported operating income of $351 million for its chicken business in the quarter ended Dec. 27 , up almost 40 percent on the year . <p> Trade restrictions could drive down prices by 5 percent to 10 percent in the United States for dark meat , which makes up the majority of chicken exports , said H.L.

@@51495541 <h> Fear of Lassa fever epidemic : Nigerians in rat race <p> Rat poison vendors in Nigeria are catching in on the momentum of Lassa fever epidemic . As at the last count , no fewer than 40 people were reported dead from the virus , according the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control ( NCDC ) . And the fear of contracting the virus is driving many Nigerians to patronizing sellers of pesticide in their bid to rid their abodes of rodents , the harbingers of this deadly virus . <p> " I have a serious phobia for rat poisons , especially those with offensive and dangerous smell because I believe if their odour could kill rodents at home then human beings too are not entirely safe . But since I discovered that rodents do n't get entrapped by mousetraps and rodent gum any longer , I have decided to give it a trial as a way of safeguarding my family against Lassa fever , " Mrs Kemi Adetula , a housewife stated . <p> A rat poison vendor who simply identified himself as David confirmed to Sunday Sun that the demand for rat poison has gone up since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the disease in not misplaced . In the past few weeks , reports claim that the disease has spread from nine to 19 states in Nigeria , while a total of 258 cases were confirmed in the month of January . The victims include seven health workers . <p> Nigeria recorded the largest outbreak of Lassa fever epidemic in 2018 with 1,081 suspected cases as of February 25 and 90 deaths . Of these figures , 317 of the cases and 72 deaths were confirmed as Lassa . According to NCDC DG , Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu , Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and cases are recorded all year round . <p> " There is usually an increase in cases of Lassa fever between November and May during the dry season . The Lassa fever virus is transmitted by rodents , which can be found in our environment . This contributes largely to the risk of spread that occurs in Nigeria and other countries with similar ecological factors , " he said . <p> The World Health Organisation describes the disease as a viral haemorrhagic fever with symptoms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the world body put the fatality rate of about one per cent , experts say it may be higher in Nigeria owing to the large number of unreported cases . <p> A medical expert , Dr Abiodun Folarin , said getting accurate statistics in a country like Nigeria where the people are very secretive and cagey , especially with the issue of health could be a herculean task . " Again when we look at it from the figure released by NCDC so far , one can conveniently argue that the fatality rate is more than one per cent as projected by WHO , " he stated . <p> More worrisome dimension to the outbreak of Lassa fever is that there is currently no vaccine against the virus . <p> " Currently , there is no known vaccine to protect against Lassa fever . Therefore , we only rely on strengthening measures such as ensuring proper sanitation , good personal hygiene and standard care precautions by health workers to prevent the spread of Lassa fever . These measures also depend on personal responsibility as we all have a role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . <p> Although most Nigerians who spoke to Sunday Sun claimed to have doubled their efforts at combating pest in order to safeguard their homes against Lassa fever , experts say pest management could prove trickier than one could imagine . " Depending solely on traditional housekeeping routine is no longer reliable at a period like this because rats have a way of surviving such onslaught especially when one lives in densely populated areas , where those living around you may not see any compelling reason to commit their time and energy to such exercise . This is why it is advisable to seek the help of professionals , " Abiola Shodeke , a pest management expert , said . <p> Shodeke identified food items , shops , stores and eateries as possible breeding ground for Lassa fever , and urged Nigerians to be cautious and watchful about where they buy their food items . <p> According to him , " the government should beam their focus on dealers of food items and eateries . These are the places you get to see all sizes and categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these places pay less attention to them . So , a customer , who maintains high level of cleanliness and personal hygiene at home could fall victim of this deadly virus owing to the carelessness of the people who manage these outlets , " he said . <p> He called on the government to come with an initiative which will compel owners of such outlets to put in place measures that will help to sanitize their environment in the same manner organizations are compelled to put certain safety measures in place . <p> " The government has set minimum safety measures for organizations and institutions that is why you see schools , offices , petrol stations with fire extinguishers , fire alarm system and conspicuous information about where to gather and what to do in case of any disaster . It will not be out of place if the government compels food store and eatery operators to also put similar measures that will help to rid their environment of dangerous pest such as rats " , he said . <p> Lassa fever was discovered in Niger State , Nigeria in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was discovered . It is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family Arenaviridae . Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease , meaning that human beings become infected from contact with infected animals . The animal reservoir or host of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus Mastomys , commonly known as the " multi-mammate rat . " Mastomys rats infected with Lassa virus do not become ill , but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces . <p> Lassa fever is largely transmitted through contact with items or surfaces contaminated with urine , faeces , saliva or blood of infected rats . It can also be transmitted from person-to-person through contact with blood , urine , faeces and other body fluids of an infected person . <p> Lassa fever presents initially like any other febrile illness such as malaria .

" I would say our relationship and our interaction ( with the U.S. ) is going well -- it 's almost daily at all levels of government -- to make sure that we protect the safety of all Canadians . " <p> The muted statement stood in contrast to alarm in the U.S. , where critics fear President Donald Trump and members of his administration are more preoccupied with managing the political fallout in an election year than they are with the crisis itself . <p> " The notion that we ca n't do our day jobs and work on this very serious issue is absurd , " Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told a conference call . " We 're taking COVID-19 incredibly seriously , and our teams , our public-health agencies , are actively working as we sit here and also trying to reform the entire health-care system . " <p> Champagne said the U.S. asked for Canada 's help repatriating some of the 237 Canadians from the Grand Princess cruise ship , which docked Monday in Oakland , Calif . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Trenton , Ont. , while any Canadians who test positive will stay behind and undergo treatment in the United States . <p> Canada has been working closely with the U.S. on the cruise passengers " to make sure that not only do we protect the health and safety of Canadians both at home and abroad , but we also are mindful of how we can protect North America from the threat of the virus , " he said . <p> Dr. Robert Kadlec , the assistant secretary for preparedness and response in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , said local California residents would leave the ship first , followed by the foreign nationals , including the Canadians . The remaining passengers will remain on board until Tuesday . <p> All passengers are being tested before disembarking . No details about the health of the Canadian passengers were released . <p> In an election year , it 's hardly surprising that Trump would be preoccupied with the political consequences . <p> " The more we know about this developing crisis , the more it is becoming clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our current dysfunctional health-care system is vastly underprepared for this pandemic , " Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders said in an email to supporters . <p> " Sadly , I have very little confidence in the Trump administration to do anything that is right or decent , or certainly based on science . " <p> Then there was the market reaction : a 2,000-point plunge in the Dow Jones index on a frantic day that saw trading halted temporarily to give investors a chance to catch their breath and resist panic selling . <p> Cross-border supply chains are already beginning to feel the impact , said Dan Ujczo , a trade lawyer in Columbus , Ohio , who specializes in the Canada-U.S. corridor . <p> One central issue for suppliers and manufacturers is the question of " force majeure " -- a legal principle that refers to a major disruption like a war , civil unrest , a natural disaster or " act of God " that makes it impossible to fulfil the terms of a contract . Whether the outbreak can be considered as such is sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " At the moment , everyone is just putting out the fires of the day to keep supply chains moving , " he said . " The fallout will come later in the spring , as companies regroup to assess economic impact , restructure procurement and suppliers , and , of course , litigate for damages . " <p> The political and the practical intersected in other ways Monday . <p> Liberal MP Anthony Housefather and Toronto city councillor Josh Matlow said they would be self-isolating for precautionary reasons after three people who attended a prominent pro-Israel conference in Washington last week tested positive for the virus . Housefather attended the conference in person , while Matlow said he had contact with an attendee . Neither has symptoms . <p> Trump himself may have had contact , too : he was photographed shaking hands with Matt Schlapp , chairman of the American Conservative Union , during the Conservative Political Action Conference last month . Schlapp reportedly shook hands with an attendee who later tested positive . The president has also had close contact with two House Republicans who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not acknowledge those encounters Monday during a late-day news conference , where he teased plans coming Tuesday for a payroll-tax cut and other measures to mitigate the economic impact of the crisis . Nor did he answer shouted questions about whether he had been tested . <p> He did -- repeatedly -- insist that no one could have seen the outbreak coming .

A measurement in the 2019 report that should send shivers of fear down the spines of Americans , in the context of the current crisis , is the one for access to care .

It is north of the Arctic Circle , but still within the treeline . <p> McPherson was , and is , proud and resilient , with a long and fabled history that includes the stories of the Mad Trapper of Rat River and of the Dawson City boys , who , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to the Yukon Gold Rush town 600 kilometres to the south . <p> Tetlit Zheh was also a small community , with fewer than a thousand people . There were resident nurses , an Anglican priest , RCMP officers , a social worker and a school ( where we taught ) . For many essential services , however , the community had to turn to volunteers . <p> Among those services was gravedigging -- which explains how I found myself , on a cold winter 's evening , helping dig the grave for the late Reverend James Simon , an esteemed member of the community . My colleagues in this task , all local people , were good natured , and leavened our grim enterprise with jokes . <p> The joking stopped , however , when , every once in a while , our shovels hit a long-forgotten coffin , buried in an unmarked grave . The other gravediggers explained to me that those coffins contained the remains of people carried away by the flu epidemic that ravaged the community four and a half decades earlier , in 1928 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quickly , they said , that the few remaining able-bodied people , who were not themselves debilitated by illness , barely had time to bury the dead .

The 1928 outbreak killed more than a tenth of the people of McPherson , and had a similar devastating effect throughout Canada 's North . <p> Worse than its immediate impact , the flu epidemic diminished the people of the North 's resistance to other illnesses from the outside world that were about to attack with full fury .

As a parent of a tween the pressure of ' keeping calm and carrying on ' is indeed essential . Your child is at that awkward age of uncertainty . Tweenhood is the development period when kids begin to shift their focus shifts from the nucleus of family to the outside world . They are more aware of world events and actively watching . They look to you for reactions , guidance , and support . If you present in a frenzied panic , your kids are sure to follow . <p> In an effort to contain the virus many schools are temporarily closing their doors and taking the teaching online .

It is your job to hold the line . <h> Striking the Balance <p> Many of us have also are able to work from home . While others have been suddenly stressed to find swift childcare solutions . For those working from home it quickly becomes about striking the balance between putting in a day 's work while tending to the needs of your tweens .

" Senior management has been working diligently to address issues as they evolve to evaluate and focus on the safety of our staff and residents . In the short term , we 're ramping up our business continuity efforts and continuing business as usual . " <p> Speaking to MidlandToday Tuesday , Mayor Ted Walker said the township does n't plan to follow neighbouring Tiny Township 's lead and declare a state of emergency . <p> Walker said that sometimes an emergency is declared so a municipality can avail of some provincial grants , such as the disaster relief fund . <p> " But in this case , it 's not necessary for us to declare emergency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or province , " he said . " In our case , it would be more on a service level where we had a shortage of staff or something and certain services have to be reduced . " <p> The municipality has informed the province about revenue losses with the provincial government indicating that it will be reviewing the situation with the federal government , as well as the possibility of using the disaster relief fund to help municipalities recoup lost revenue . <p> Barron , meanwhile , noted during the special council meeting that the township may decide to add another barrier between the public and staff . <p> " It 's valuable even in the regular flu season . We will no longer accept cash from next week . It 's a germ carrier . Our frontline staff have decided they want to wear gloves as an added precaution . " <p> She said they 're also working on setting up an alternate office location that will not be disclosed to the public . <p> " Staff have been working getting all of the right tools in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Barron . " It will provide a separation , in the event that this office is contaminated or has a case , we still have staff at the other location to continue business as it needs to . " <p> All committee meetings will be cancelled and public meetings planned for the end of April will be deferred , she said . Council and committee of all council will continue as scheduled , however delegations will be given the option to reschedule if they choose . <p> Barron said staff has been talking with area municipalities for mutual response and services , particularly for water and wastewater operations and for cooperation between fire departments . <p> The townships of Tiny , Springwater , Severn and Ramara have already closed their office doors to the public . <p> " We are still of the opinion that we can continue to operate and will continue to do so until we can , " Barron said , noting that it appears municipalities can make their own decisions regarding office closures . <p> " I think people are just reacting , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call this morning and no clear way forward came out .

" Will we be entering houses if we have calls ?

" <p> Public Works director Peter Dance said employees have a moral obligation to phone the health unit . <p> " We do n't want to be too fussy about what you 've got , " he said . " If someone is significantly sick with the flu , we do n't want to see them here . If you 're sick enough to have significant symptoms , we do n't want them in the building .

We should be very careful about saying the test is a requirement , because we wo n't be able to meet that requirement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ township would have to bring it to the attention of the health unit if an employee shared they 're showing symtoms ? <p> " They will be self-isolating at that time , " said Thomas . " They will call the health unit to get an over-the-phone evaluation and a test if it is warranted . " <p> Coun. Barry Norris asked if the plan for providing 75% wages would apply if staff decided to travel after Tuesday . <p> " How many days is it being limited for , 14 , 28 or are we leaving it at the discretion of senior staff ? " asked Norris . " If they come back after a 14-day quarantine and then ask for another 14 days because they 're showing symoptoms again , how do we go about that ? " <p> Barron said the extension would n't be automatic , especially since the federal government has issued directives limiting international travel . <p> " One of the things we talked about , upon return to work , we ask the employee to fill out a self-declaration form , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , but it would be looked at on a case-by-case basis .

I touch my face -- a lot . <p> I convinced Star digital producer Braydon Holmyard to follow me to work , making notes on my " touch points " and then what I do next over the course of three streetcar transfers . <p> Next , I enlisted the help of Cynthia Carr , an epidemiologist and health policy expert , and Dr. Monika Dutt , a physician who works in public heath , to critique my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay healthy . <p> I admit , this is an imperfect experiment : I knew I was being watched but tried to honestly follow my impulses . If I needed to touch a handrail on the streetcar in order to keep my balance , I did . I sanitized my hands when the urge struck , more often than I would have in the past . <p> Here 's a breakdown of what we recorded , in five-minute intervals . <p> 8:35 a.m . <p> I touched my face before getting on the streetcar . Then I pulled out my wallet to tap my Presto . <p> I touched four bars to steady myself on the way to a seat , then tucked my hair behind my ear . <p> Carr said the need to touch the bars is an exercise in risk reduction . " If we take the messaging too far about possible spread of virus through contaminated surfaces , we risk making other decisions that are more likely to harm us , " she said . " The bars that you touched to balance yourself are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> From a risk reduction standpoint , touching the bars is safer than a fall . <p> I took my backpack off , put it on my lap and sat down . <p> I sat beside one person on this streetcar . <p> " Droplet transmission of infections can occur when you 're close to someone , " Dutt said . " You do often need to be around people and often those social interactions are important . But if you see someone coughing , try to sit at least one metre away from them if possible . " <p> 8:40 a.m . <p> I fix my hair . <p> Touching my hair bothers Carr and Dutt less than some of my other behaviours . " An infection getting from the back ( or ) side of your head " into the eyes or mouth would be less likely , Dutt said . <p> I pull out my phone to check a message . <p> " We know that phones can have bacteria and viruses on them , " Dutt said . " We handle them all the time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course wash your own hands regularly . " <p> I touch my chin . <p> " This is real life and you have not touched your mouth , nose or eyes , " Carr said . <p> I get off the streetcar to transfer and pull a strand of hair out of my mouth . <p> The wind is blowing , which means I am constantly moving my hair out of my face while walking to the next stop . <p> These two points are " slightly higher risk , " Carr said . But I did n't put my hands in my mouth . " You are pulling your hair out of your mouth -- you are not putting your hands in your mouth . " <p> It 's important to " be reasonable , " Dutt said . " This type of thing happens . We do n't need to be completely obsessed . " <p> Until we do . <p> I touch my face . <p> " Noooo ! ! ! " Dutt wrote . <p> " Not ideal , " Carr said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importantly avoid your mouth , nose and eyes . " <p> I , finally , use some hand sanitizer while waiting for the streetcar . <p> Carr said I should have used the hand sanitizer before the face touch . " According to statistics you are going to touch your face again so this will be helpful for the next time , " she said . <p> 8:55 a.m . <p> Pull out my wallet and presto , then tap to transfer . <p> " Good examples of the daily items we touch regularly and never clean , " Dutt said . <p> Remove my backpack and put it on my lap before sitting down alone next to a window . <p> " You use these items daily and often put these items down on surfaces when you are paying for things ... If you do n't keep ( clean ) the items " you touch all day long , it provides a vehicle for germs to reach you , Carr said . <p> Someone gets on and sits directly beside me . Someone else sits down across from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than one metre away . <p> Dutt said droplet transmission is possible within two metres . She said it is something to keep in mind -- " especially if someone is coughing or sneezing . " <p> I inexplicably touch the window . <p> Get the latest in your inbox <p> Never miss the latest news from the Star , including up-to-date coronavirus coverage , with our free email newsletters <p> " Your eyes are a particularly easy surface for viruses to enter , " Dutt said , noting that anything I picked up on the window could now be transferred to my face . <p> The proximity of these two actions is possibly my riskiest behaviour , Carr said . " People sitting by the window are often looking that way which means they are often breathing on the window ... if someone were to cough or sneeze in that direction , there could be respiratory droplets on that window , " she said . That said , though , it 's unclear how long droplets containing a virus could survive on the window . <p> 9 a.m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often attached to our hands , we should be more conscious of keeping ( them ) clean , " Dutt said . <p> I unconsciously touch my lip , then continue texting . <p> " It is possible that when you used the phone this time , you may have come back in contact with that virus and then transmitted it to your mouth , " Carr said . Her advice ? Just keep sanitizing the phone as often as possible . <p> Flipping through my purse to find my hand sanitizer . When I finally find it , I use it . <p> " Great ! " Dutt said . " Sanitizer can be as effective as soap and water when hands are not visibly soiled . " <p> Our streetcar is short-turning , so I press the stop button and need to hold a bar to steady myself . <p> " Many , many hands touch both of these items , " Dutt reminds me . <p> At the streetcar stop , I check my phone while we wait for the final transfer -- a 10-minute wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third and final streetcar . We manage to sneak on through the back doors , but we 're extremely close to about five others . <p> Neither expert was as worried about the sardine-can ride as I expected : since no one was coughing or sneezing , risk was low . <p> I text again . <p> We are at the final stop and get off at an underground terminal . <p> There are stairs , but I do n't touch the railing while I 'm walking up . At the top , I sanitize my hands . <p> " Hand sanitizer is good , " Dutt said , especially due to how many things I touched . <p> Coffee time . I open the door to the coffee shop and pick up my cup from the mobile-order counter . <h> More from The Star &amp; Partners <h> More News <h> Top Stories <p> Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited .

@@51563341 <p> For anyone who has lived in Karachi , particularly in the 1990s and late 2000s , the current scenes in Pakistan 's largest city are a familiar sight . Rangers are patrolling outside markets , shops have been shuttered , and schools have been ordered closed . <p> But unlike other hartaals , the roads are still open . And the quasi-lockdown is not just being enforced in one locality , or one neighbourhood- it is across Karachi , across Hyderabad , across Sindh . And unlike other hartaals , it will not end with just a phone call from London . It will end with a vaccine cure , and at a much heavier cost . <p> This is Karachi 's -- and soon , Pakistan 's -- self-imposed corona hartaal . With the number of COVID-19 cases at the time of writing now reaching 510 with 3 confirmed deaths , the gravity of the situation is only just dawning upon us . Recently , the Chief Minister of Punjab , Usman Buzdar , was infamously quoted in Dawn asking the seminal question , " So how does this corona bite again ? " While no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant , you can take it to the bank that he will not be making that same mistake anytime soon . <p> So in these stressful times , who do we look to ? Well , there are two significant events in Pakistan 's COVID-19 timeline . <p> First , Prime Minister Imran Khan addressed the country on Tuesday , and talked to journalists on Friday . <p> His comments are notable for two aspects . One , in an attempt to perhaps calm the nation down , he came off as extremely relaxed . " Aap ne ghabrana nahi hai ( do not panic ) " -- which inspires little confidence . PM Khan did not think the virus was too much of a risk , since 97% of those who get it recover from it , never mind that the mortality rate for Covid-19 has gone up to nearly 11% as the crisis hits the gas . <p> His second notable talking point was corollary to his initial sense of chill , that cities will not be shut down . " If we shutdown the cities -- people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from corona at one end , but they will die from hunger on the other side , " he said . <p> The Prime Minister 's argument was that Pakistan was not in the same position as the United States or Europe , that we could not possibly hope to afford a shut down . He is correct to an extent , there is great poverty in Pakistan , and the fear is that people might starve . The government seems to have taken this decision quite early , having considered a shutdown when Pakistan was at 20 cases , but seems to be adamant that it will not happen now . <p> Separately , on Friday , he said , " There is a reason for this . Our situation can not be compared to , for example , Italy ; their per capita income and their economic situation are much better than ours . If we impose a nation-wide lockdown , we fear for our daily wage workers and labourers . What will they do for the next few weeks ? " <p> In his quest to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prime minister is allowing cities for now , to function . There have been no severe travel restrictions by air yet , restaurants and shops in Punjab are still open , and Friday prayers across the country are still allowed ( will the Council of Islamic Ideology please wake up ? ) . Only the province of Sindh has imposed some restrictions on shops and malls , and even there Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has requested voluntary social distancing . <p> The second significant event is the recent measures the State Bank has taken . <p> On Tuesday 's monetary policy announcement , the central bank cut the policy rate by 75 basis points , from 13.35% to 12.5% . The bank also announced two new measures to provide subsidised credit to industry : the Rs100 billion Temporary Economic Refi ? nance Scheme ( TERF ) for non export-oriented sectors , and the Rs5 billion Refinance Facility for Com ? bating COVID-19 ( RFCC ) , which will allow hospitals to get loans from banks at a 3% interest to get equipment needed for hospitals . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for exporters suffering from the delay . These include relaxing the requirements to avail credit , allowing for longer times for payments and export import proceeds , and longer time to ship goods . <p> Profit took these two events and posed some questions to Pakistan 's economists , policy experts and business leaders : what do they think of these measures ? How are businesses being impacted ? As salaries are affected and people 's bank accounts deplete , how do we prevent poverty ? And what are some effective ways of your business surviving pandemic ? <p> First , the economists and policy experts <p> Abid Suleri , the Executive Director of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute , said that he appreciated the decision not to take a full lockdown . " We are neither a centralized government and economy , as in the case of China , where lockdown is possible on a single order of the government , nor are we a social welfare state like many European countries , where people can be made to sit at home and get economic compensation for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that if a lockdown becomes essential , then the Government of Pakistan will have to ensure that daily wage earners can sustain the lockdown . He advocated methods such as releasing advance payments for BISP beneficiaries ; using some proxy indicators , like the number of electricity units consumed , to provide tariff relief ; and mobilizing individual philanthropists to provide to society . <p> Suleri was less enthusiastic about the State bank 's business-as-usual measures . For him , with the recent experience of stock exchanges around the world , the State bank should have realised that market sentiments can not be improved by slashing the interest rate . " You can not hope to manage this , not even by slashing them to zero as in the US , only while dealing with a pandemic . " <p> Instead he wanted the SBP to focus on defining the worst and best case scenarios for the spread of COVID-19 , and also hopefully bargain with the IMF for flexibility on the monetary target slippage . <p> Interestingly , he also wanted to encourage philanthropists . " Pakistan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right now , we should encourage corporations and the private sector to play their role and divert their CSR funds for that purpose . We should organize a community of volunteers under a nodal ministry to do this . " <p> On the bright side , he noted that investment , research , and hiring in the medical sector should flourish . The government could also gain some fiscal cushion through decreased oil bills . " I am envisaging that the government would save $5 billion in oil import bill . This should help the government in compensating for revenue loss and be able to boost some positive sentiments . " said Suleri . <p> Meanwhile economist Salman Shah , the current advisor to the Chief Minister of Punjab on economic affairs , was conflicted about the idea of a lockdown . " Two million people are likely to lose their jobs considering the size of the informal economy . If we think about transfers , a stipend for three months for these two million would cost the country in trillions of rupees. , " he said . <p> Worryingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackle a problem this large . " The need is many times more than what Ehsaas has , " he explains . " The Informal workforces in SMEs , and small micro-businesses probably have no access to banking . We will have to devise ways to accommodate them . " <p> He also called for the SBP to be innovative , as cutting an interest rate at this time will not spur any investment . He called for the arrangement of a lot of working capital at a lower cost , in order to truly increase investment . <p> Looking to the future , Shah said retail and value chains will change forever . " There will be a lot more digitalization going forward , a lot more alternative means for delivering goods and services , online shopping The changes have been coming over the years , but this will accelerate it . Offices will also have to reduce a lot of unnecessary meetings " . <p> Once Pakistan survives the pandemic , Shah expects a lot of opportunities ahead . " Oil prices will lay low for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should get a share of the diversification . CPEC will become more important if we are to finish it soon . " <p> Asad Zaman , member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the SBP , said that he thought the SBP did what needed to be done . Regarding the interest rate cut , he said : " Even some economists were arguing that the interest rate needed to be 8% . The interest rate needs to be higher than the inflation rate , for the real interest rate to be positive -- for an economist to suggest otherwise is really an outrageous political statement . " <p> He also argued that the crisis represented a massive opportunity for the government to implement radical change . " We could institute large scale social welfare , just like PM Khan has been wanting to do : <p> According to Naveed Iftikhar , adjunct faculty at Lahore University of Management Sciences ( LUMS ) , thinks that PM Khan should have clearly spelt out resource allocation and mechanisms to spend the public money to fight the pandemic . <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has to suggest avoid panic . But he was also supposed to lay out his plans to boost the confidence of people . I think we need to limit economic and social activities for at least 3-4 weeks . " said Iftikhar . <p> He also said a comprehensive social protection package should be announced for almost 30% of the bottom households in the economy , with a mix of cash and food supply . <p> Adnan Haider , Associate Professor of Economics at IBA , went so far as to say that a lockdown was economically feasible , and should be done immediately . " If he PM Khan goes for a strict policy , poor and daily wage workers will suffer most . Let us not forget that 24.7% of the population is living below the poverty line , which means their monthly income is less than 4000 rupees . In public policy , you have to make choices . Sometimes , less evil is an optimal one . " he said . <p> Now , the business people <p> Usman Gul , the CEO of Airlift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of complete lockdown over the next two to four weeks . His company is one of the few that was quick to act , shutting down a service that was based on the opposite of social distancing . <p> " As cities are locked down , businesses will either need to or be forced to , suspend services and operations . In the case of corporate workers , this will likely result in individuals working from home . In the case of the most marginalized segment of society , we will see a clear impact on income in the form of lost jobs or less work . " <p> He called for relief funds set up jointly by the private sector and the government to lessen the blow of catastrophe . <p> Nauman Lakhani , country manager at Dun and Bradstreet Pakistan , which provides data and analytics to businesses , also expressed disappointment with the State Bank . " The central bank again here could have done more as it was expected in the market and demonstrated by other economies . Historical low-interest rates are common now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for Pakistan is high . " <p> Lakhani expects the state bank to announce further cuts and economic measures in the coming weeks . <p> " The domino effect of the closure of shops , malls , offices , buses , trains , and especially SMEs will have a ripple effect on the economic degradation . We are dependent on China for a large portion of our trade . If those import-related trade is not affecting the economy , then they should be disallowed or curbed to reduce the import bill post normalization . " Lakhani added , <p> Interestingly , he said that businesses are still optimistic . " Pakistani people and Pakistani firms have seen many economic cycles . We as people are quite passionate about charity . If we can support Afghanistan at this time , then why not our own people ? I do not remember in the recent history of hunger being an issue . " <p> Asfandyar Farrukh , the Managing Director at Hub Leather was concerned about the drop-off in consumer spending expected because of the virus . In particular , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already frail retail sector . <p> " Retail revenues for non-food and non-medical items in parts of the country have been below 50% for over a week now due to partial closures and are rapidly shrinking towards zero sales . Retail is the front-end of many associated businesses such as raw material manufacturing , weaving , dyeing , stitching , assembling and several service-oriented businesses that rely on retail , " he said . <p> Farrukh also highlighted that retail contributes around 16% of the total workforce of Pakistan . " It is not possible to pay salaries with zero revenue . If there is no substantial relief from the government and landlords within a few days , the majority of this sector could go bankrupt and many other sectors may go down with it over the next few weeks and months . " <p> While he was more positive about the SBO , he did think loans for new investments seemed like wishful thinking : " The SBP needs to immediately divert its focus from encouraging loans for new investments ( TERF ) , which are not expected ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of easy zero-interest loans and credit facilities before they shut down and can not reopen . " <p> Wasif Sikandar Butt , Director at clothing brand Maria B , believed PM Khan 's speech was realistic . " As a textile brand we understand the thousands of people depend on daily work in the entire textile chain to make ends meet . If the Government can come up with a plan to ensure provision of basics goods to the most vulnerable -- then learning from other countries we should go for a short but complete shutdown to tackle this effectively . " <p> He was however , gravely concerned about the retail sector : " The current meltdown in the retail sector has resulted in a complete drying up of cash flows especially for the non-food and grocery segments . In the coming days we will need strong policy support from the SBP to ensure businesses have emergency access to liquidity and waivers on debt repayments to banks . " <p> He went on to say that this was the biggest crisis the retail sector had ever faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now experiencing a 50 to 70% drop in sales , and most businesses will not have sufficient sales to even cover salaries , let alone rents , taxes , or bank payments . " Our supply chains which include spinning , weaving , processing and embroidery are grinding to a halt due to liquidity crisis and lack of further orders from the retail sector . " he said . <p> Moving forward , Butt said the government must intervene : " We just have to look at what steps other countries have already announced to help retail businesses such as Government backed rental waivers , tax and utility waivers , interest free loans etc . Once business owners see that their losses have been reduced with government help then then no business would want to let go of their employees . " <p> Shahid Nazir , the CEO of Masood Textile Mills ( the 10th largest textile exporter of Pakistan ) , said that the release of DDT funds was appreciated , but was quite inefficient . " The government must release funds to exporters on account of pending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the government for compensation on account of payments to workers without production . " He also said that the SBP is expected to freeze markup and defer principal repayment of commercial banks from exporters . <p> Adil Bashir , the chairman of APTMA Punjab , said he was disappointed by the State Bank . " Inventories have started to build up due to cancellation and delays in shipments and the export oriented sector can not bear such high interest rates . The SBP should waive interest rates for three months and freeze all repayments till the Coronavirus situation improves . This meager reduction in interest rates will lead to large scale closures if inventories do not move . " <p> Veqar ul Islam , the director of Jaffer Business Systems , and policy board memebr of the SECP , thought the PM 's speech was an enagaging one , but was concerned about the implications of a lockdown . " It is a tough call . Damned if you do , as you kill poor and daily wagers with hunger and unemployment . Damned if you do not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe a two weeks lockdown may be a better idea , but then I may not be showing a lot of consideration to the poor in coming up with this conclusion , " he said . <p> As for the State Bank , he was less enthusiastic : " I am clearly disappointed with the small decrease in interest rates . Around the world , rates are cut to provide stimulus to the economy . These are not normal times . I have not experienced anything like this in my life . In abnormal times you do not make normal decisions and follow a cookie-cutter approach . " <p> Speaking on businesses , he said that just about everything will be affected . " Slow down is visible and you can literally feel it by the hour and day . Businesses will cut down on expenses to sustain these difficult times , they will delay hirings and any expansion plans . Layoffs are a real possibility . " <p> But is there also a possibility for innovation ? Says Islam : " We can leapfrog into a new era which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses have moved to Remote working , schools have moved to online learnings , the health system is working with remote support , even Govt is working remotely like PM having a meeting of coordination committee digitally . I would like to see these become a lifestyle once we are out of this . We can actually cover the distance of lost decades in the next few months to match with the top nations of the world " <p> Ammar Habib , head of APAC Investments , i5 Capital , was in the minority of those who viewed SBP positively . " From my conversations with business owners , high-interest rates have been one of the key pain points during our austerity measures in 2019 . Lower borrowing rates should hopefully get business expansion into motion . " <p> He , too , was conflicted about the effect of a shutdown of the economy .

Depending on each child , they may latch on to a piece of information that is really frightening , " Boksman said . <p> She found this out first-hand with her older child , who had just finished a historical fiction book set during an outbreak of the bubonic plague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys , I need to tell you guys about this thing that is going on in case you hear about it at school or get misinformation from your friends . There 's this thing that 's going on called a pandemic . ' He knew exactly what that meant , his eyes went as large as saucers , and he said , ' Oh my God , we are all going to die ! ' " <p> Tell them your family is trying to keep other people safe <p> Boksman soothed some of her children 's fears by being clear what they and the rest of the family would be doing to keep themselves and the rest of the community safe . <p> " I explained the concept of social distancing to them first : ' This is a thing that we are doing where the whole world is working together to help each other to stay safe . Some people will get really sick from this virus and what we are doing is to protect the people who are likely to get really sick . ' " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because this is a virus like the flu but our bodies have n't seen it before , most of us will get sick in one way or another when we have the virus , but most of us will be perfectly OK . But because all of us will get sick at the same time if we do n't stay apart , if we can remain in our houses , not touch things , be really good about washing our hands and remind everyone to be careful , we can slow the spread , and the people who get really sick can still get the medical care they need . " <p> Do n't scare them about getting sick themselves <p> The focus , the psychologist said , should be on what they can do to be responsible and protect others , not on the dangers of the virus to themselves . Children have proven to be very resilient to COVID-19 , so there 's no need to make them worry about getting sick themselves . Tell them that if they get sick , it will be mostly like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry about getting sick . Our bodies know what to do when they get sick . We need to make sure we are protecting our doctors and nurses , as well as the people who are likely to get really sick and need to go to the hospital . That 's why we are doing this ; there 's no real risk to our lives , but we are trying to help protect our community and those we care about . " <p> Explain what they are expected to do <p> Once you have explained to your children about why your family is social distancing , be clear with them what you will be doing as a family during the pandemic and what the rules for them are . This could include rules about hand-washing or keeping their distance from other children in the neighbourhood . <p> For instance , Boksman 's family put a sign on their front door reminding the children to wash their hands when they come back inside . They have a bottle of hand sanitizer just behind the door that they use before going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happy Birthday song . <p> " They need some simple rules and simple structure , " she said . <p> " We are clear with them what we are doing to stay safe , like washing our hands . If an Amazon delivery comes , we open it outside and then we wash our hands . We can take steps to stay safe . It 's just a virus , not the Bogeyman . <p> Make them an active participant <p> One thing that Boksman 's family did was go through the house with sanitizing wipes to get the kids thinking about what are the surfaces that everyone touches and from which the virus could spread . <p> " Involving my child in a proactive way by showing them that ' these are the things you can do to help keep us safe and healthy , ' eased his stress significantly . " <p> Helping to sanitize the house helps them have confidence that being inside is safe . <p> Do n't lie to them <p> Children are going to be worried and have questions that should be answered gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about their grandparents . Tell them that their grandparents are doing the same things they are to be safe , and not going to visit them is going to help keep them safe . <p> Do not tell kids there is no chance of anyone in the house , their friends or grandparents getting sick . You could be wrong . <p> " If you lie to them and someone in the family really does get sick , they are going to be really anxious and wonder if they ca n't trust the information you are giving them . " <p> Be a role model <p> If you do n't want your children to be scared , try not to be overly anxious yourself . Children look to the adults around them for emotional cues , so if they know you are scared they will be , too . If you display confidence and make a point of following public health directives , it will make them feel more reassured and want to emulate you .

@@51570041 <h> Welcome , Biintigen to my Gardening Posts ! <p> Some of you may know me as Shy-Anne Hovorka , the former singer/songwriter and now an educator .

Then , I wanted to settle down and be here for my family , thus jumping into education -- I 'm also a humanitarian , and avid environmentalist . <p> As a mother and wife , I wanted to grow the best , chemical-free , highly nutritious food I possibly could for my son , husband and me . <p> So , I decided to become a vegetable gardener ! We have successfully been gardening for over a decade with the last 4 years eating only our own vegetables year-round . We do not use chemical fertilizer and grow our food as naturally as possible . I will be covering seeds , times to plant , what to plant , starting seeds indoors and/or in a greenhouse , organizing your garden , understanding your soil , composting , storing food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously harvesting your crops over the next few months through weekly posts/videos . <p> In light of the Covid-19 , I wanted to do something to help outside of just social distancing myself and family .

I have also been asked many times over the last few weeks questions regarding gardening , so I thought I would just start sharing publicly in a place for all to see . In addition to this , growing your own food is rewarding , and a great activity to include your kids in if you are in the situation of home-schooling due to Covid-19 as I am ! It is also a great way to get fresh air , exercise , grow to love your food , reconnect with the environment , reconnect with food , grow an appreciation for how food grows , it is a great stress reliever , and it is just nice to get your hands dirty sometimes ( especially with kids ) . <p> I will include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly . I will respond as soon as I possibly can with each question . If I do n't have the answer , I will seek out the response from other professional gardeners that I know . If the same question pops up multiple times , I will focus on that topic the following week . I will create a new blog with pictures and video links ( as available ) once a week . Please , ask questions ! I also have a video as well with basically the same info , but some people like to watch , and others like to read ! Your choice ! The video might show things a bit better as I only have a few pictures here . Would you believe that the picture above has over 100 little seedlings in it ? You do n't need a ton of space to start , but a large window with south/west exposure or a good grow light is needed . <p> In the last few weeks , I have been asking when to start specific seeds .

However , plants usually take a specific amount of time to grow ... so keep that in mind ! <p> My best advice for the beginner is to Start Small ! ! ! This can be overwhelming if you start too much too soon ! <p> January : ( ok , I know ... long gone ... but for the future ) <p> Peppers -- You can plant these in February , or even March , but you will be waiting until VERY late in the summer ( possibly fall ) until you get some . <p> Herbs -- Everything but basil for the most part . <p> February : ( Again , gone , but for next year . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these in March if you want , and even April will have success in getting fruit .

They are like babies ... they only need essentials , nothing too fortified with a variety of things for the first bit , and like babies , they will need solid food soon enough ... thus a different , more beefed up soil . This too will be a blog of its own later . There are also links to some of the products I have chatted about below . <p> An example of planting seeds in the 6 pack ... can be a 10 pack , or 4 pack , but keep things small to start for the comfort of your home , and then all plants have more light as they are in smaller areas.This is an example of plot seeding .

@@51575541 <h> Email <p> ISLAMABAD : China has asked Pakistan to open the border between the two countries for one day on Friday ( March 27 ) so that medical supplies meant to combat coronavirus could be transported . <p> The Khunjerab Pass is usually opened on April 1 which marks the end of winter in that part , but due to the global outbreak of Covid-19 , the border between Pakistan and China has been closed for an indefinite period . <p> A letter , written by the Chinese embassy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , with copies to the National Disaster Management Authority ( NDMA ) , the government of Gilgit-Baltistan and the Ministry of National Health Services , states that the governor of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China would like to donate a batch of medical materials to GB . According to the letter , the governor has donated 200,000 ordinary face masks , 2,000 N-95 face masks , five ventilators , 2,000 testing kits and 2,000 medical protective clothes mainly used by doctors and paramedics . <p> The donation is in response to a request made by GB Chief Minister Hafeezur Rehman to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The materials are ready to be delivered to GB through Khunjerab Pass at 9am Pakistan time on March 27 . Therefore , it is requested to temporarily open border the same date . In this regard , it is also highly recommended that Pakistani side should agree and make due preparation before the date so that all materials could enter Pakistan smoothly , " said the Chinese embassy 's letter . <p> Gilgit-Baltistan has high percentage of coronavirus cases in the country compared to its population , but the underdeveloped region has a negligible number of operational ventilators and remoteness has led to a severe shortage of medical equipments . <p> Earlier , NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Mohammad Afzal had said at a media briefing that protection kits and other necessary equipments being donated by China would reach Pakistan on March 28 . He added that Pakistan had sought to purchase medical equipments , including ventilators , but these were in short supply around the world and only China had assured that it would provide such items to Pakistan . <p> The Chinese embassy has also stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of porters to unload the cargo is needed . <p> Under a border protocol agreement of 1985 , the Khunjerab border crossing remains closed from the end of November to April . Trade and travel activities between the two countries take place through Khunjerab Pass , also known as Sust Dry Port -- the only land route between China and Pakistan . <p> Meanwhile , a GB government official told Dawn that the relevant federal agencies , including the National Logistic Cell , customs department and Federal Intelligence Agency , suggested to the GB government on Wednesday that the supplies might be imported using C-130 cargo aircraft since making arrangements for one day only might be difficult because there was no indication that the Sust border crossing would be opened from April 1 . <p> However , no decision has been so far taken by the federal government in this regard . <h> Comments ( 104 ) Closed <p> Again .. what are they exporting from China to Pakistan ?

That led Fox to offer affiliates the option to air the Texas virtual race on broadcast . <p> Those who tuned in watched a live video game of 35 NASCAR racers competing at an exact replica of Texas Motor Speedway , where the series was scheduled to be Sunday before the coronavirus shutdown . Fox was able to obtain feeds of drivers racing on simulators everywhere from their bedrooms , basements , garages and , in the case of last week 's winner , Denny Hamlin 's living room . <p> Clint Bowyer was the in-race reporter again , but when the booth cut to him to ask about an early race incident , he gave a quick update and shooed Joy and Gordon away . <p> " You guys are bothering me , sorry , " Bowyer said . <p> Alex Bowman again entertained fans via social media with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove through somebody , " after a wreck .

OF COURSE , ALL THE LABS AT UNIVERSITIES ARE CLOSED SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY DISCUSSED YESTERDAY , AND I KNOW THERE 'S ANOTHER CALL WITH THE CHIEF SCIENCE ADVISOR SOMETIME THIS WEEK , IS HOW WE OPEN UP SOME SELECT LABS AT UNIVERSITIES TO MOVE THIS FORWARD . <p> Steve says WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO HAZARD A GUESS , THOUGH , BY SAYING , I DO N'T KNOW WHAT ? FIVE PERCENT ? 25 PERCENT ? HALF OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IS IN ON THIS , OR WHAT ? <p> Alan says I 'M GOING TO HAZARD A GUESS , IF YOU REALLY PUSH ME , TO ABOUT 10 TO 20 PERCENT . THE PROBLEM IS WHAT I JUST SAID , THAT UNIVERSITIES ARE CLOSED . <p> Steve says GOTCHA . ROB , LET ME ASK YOU . YOU AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A VACCINE OR SOME KIND OF SOLUTION TO ALL OF THIS , AND I GATHER IT WAS YOUR TEAM THAT ISOLATED WHAT IS TECHNICALLY CALLED SARS-CoV-2 IN THE FIRST PLACE . WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY MEAN ? <p> Robert says SO WHAT WE DID IS WE ISOLATED THE VIRUS ... YOU 'RE CORRECT ... WITH NOT JUST MY COLLEAGUE HERE AT SUNNYBROOK BUT ALSO COLLABORATORS AT McMASTER WERE WORKING ON THIS AND WE ARE WORKING WITH OTHER GROUPS SUCH AS A GROUP IN LAVAL ON VACCINE WORK . THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS WAS NOW WE HAVE A VIRUS THAT CAN BE USED NOT JUST BY OUR GROUP BUT BY MANY GROUPS FOR TESTING THERAPEUTICS , FOR TESTING VACCINES , FOR IMPROVING DIAGNOSTICS . IT 'S SOMETHING WE 'RE HOPING TO GET OUT AS QUICK AS WE CAN TO A LOT OF LABS TO REALLY PUSH THE SCIENCE FORWARD . <p> Steve says ALAN , WE APPRECIATE WE 'RE NOT LIVING UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT NOW , BUT UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES , WHEN A PROBLEM HITS , HOW LONG DOES IT THEN TAKE TO CREATE A VACCINE ? <p> Alan says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 YEARS AGO , AND WE STILL DO N'T HAVE A VACCINE . IT 'S A VERY DIFFICULT VIRUS . FOR THIS VIRUS , I THINK THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN THROWN AROUND ARE ONE TO TWO YEARS . I THINK THAT 'S A REASONABLE TIME ESTIMATE . ONE OF THE ISSUES , YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE IS , TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE , YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE VACCINE CANDIDATE , THE VOLUNTEERS , AND THERE HAS TO BE HIGH INCIDENCE OF THE DISEASE IN THE POPULATION TO KNOW WHETHER ACTUALLY THE VACCINE CANDIDATE IS PROTECTIVE . SO WHEN SARS-1 BROKE OUT IN 2003 , WE REALLY STARTED , WHEN I WAS PRESIDENT OF CIFAR , AN INITIATIVE TO DEVELOP A VACCINE , BUT SARS , THE DISEASE , DISAPPEARED . NOT ONLY WAS THERE NO NEED FOR THE VACCINE BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO TEST IT TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS EFFECTIVE . <p> Steve says ROB , I 'M NOT SURE WHETHER WE 'RE GOING TO GET LUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE THIS DISAPPEAR , COVID-19 , I MEAN . ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RESOURCES ARE NOT REALLY ABLE TO BE BROUGHT TO BEAR IN A WAY WE 'D LIKE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE LABS ARE SHUT DOWN . SO CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND WHETHER THE TIMELINE OF A YEAR OR TWO MAKES SENSE FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW ? <p> Robert says ABSOLUTELY . I THINK , YEAH , A TIMELINE FROM ONE TO TWO YEARS IS ACTUALLY QUITE REASONABLE . I KNOW THAT THERE ARE LABS WORKING ON IT THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE MOVING AS FAST AS THEY CAN TO GET THE DATA AND TO DO ALL THE NECESSARY TRIALS , BUT I DO N'T ... I THINK IT 'S SOMETHING WHERE YOU DO N'T WANT TO CUT ANY CORNERS BECAUSE YOU WANT A SAFE AND EFFICACIOUS VACCINE BUT YOU WANT TO MOVE AS QUICK AS WE CAN . ONE OF THE I GUESS A BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE TO THIS BEING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC IS , EVEN IF ... AND I HOPE WE ARE ABLE TO CONTROL IT HERE IN CANADA , THAT WE DO N'T SEE AN INCREASE IN CASES , BUT IF WE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERE , THERE 'S THE POSSIBILITY FOR IT TO BE DEPLOYED IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE MORE CASES , IN OTHER COUNTRIES , WHERE IT COULD BE USED IN ORDER TO POTENTIALLY HELP MITIGATE THEIR OUTBREAK . SOMETHING SIMILAR THAT WAS ACTUALLY DONE WITH THE VACCINE AGAINST EBOLA A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO . <p> Steve says ROB , I 'M REMINDING YOU YOU 'RE NOT TALKING TO NECESSARILY A SCIENTIFICALLY LITERATE AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW . CAN YOU TAKE US THROUGH A BIT OF THE PROCESS OF HOW YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE MANAGED TO ISOLATE THIS VIRUS ? <p> Robert says YEAH . MY PLEASURE . WHAT WE DID IS WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A SAMPLE THAT WE HAD TAKEN FROM A PATIENT FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES . IF YOU CAME INTO THE HOSPITAL , WE DO A SWAB OF YOUR NOSE AND IT 'S IN A TYPE OF MEDIA THAT WE THEN USE FOR PCR TO IDENTIFY THE VIRUS . WE TOOK SOME OF THE REMAINING LIQUID AND THEN WE ADDED IT TO CELL LINES WHICH WE HAD A LOT OF CONFIDENCE WOULD BE ABLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A NUMBER OF EXPERTS WHO GAVE US A LOT OF TIPS AND POINTERS ON HOW TO IDEALLY ISOLATE THE VIRUS AND THEN WE JUST MONITORED BASICALLY FOR SOMETHING CALLED CYTOPATHIC ... AND FROM THAT POINT WE HARVESTED THE VIRUS , SEQUENCED IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GENOME WAS THAT OF SARS-CoV-2 , AND RIGHT NOW WE 'RE JUST IN THE PROCESS OF GROWING UP STOCKS OF IT SO ABLE TO SHARE IT WITH OTHER LABS . <p> Steve says AND HOW LONG DID ALL THAT TAKE ? <p> The caption changes to " Robert Kozak . University of Toronto . " <p> Robert says SO WE GOT PRETTY LUCKY . WE HAD THE VIRUS ISOLATED AND FULLY SEQUENCED IN JUST UNDER 3 WEEKS . <p> Steve says HMM . OKAY . ALAN , TELL US , WHERE IN THE CANADIAN CONTEXT IS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH GOING ON RIGHT NOW ? <p> Alan says WELL , THERE 'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT EFFORTS GOING ON . YOU JUST HEARD FROM ROB WHAT HIS LAB IS DOING AT SUNNYBROOK . THERE 'S A LOT OF WORK OF COURSE ON VACCINE DEVELOPMENT IN QUEBEC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA . THERE 'S A LOT OF RESEARCH ... CANADA ACTUALLY HAS ONE OF THE LEADING GROUPS ON MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF THE PANDEMIC , AND WHERE IT 'S BEEN , WHERE IT 'S GOING , AND WHAT THE MITIGATING EFFORTS ARE ... THE EFFECTS ARE HAVING ON SLOWING DOWN THIS DISEASE . YESTERDAY WE HAD A REALLY QUITE AMAZING ZOOM CALL OF CLOSE TO 80 SCIENTISTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD , EVERYTHING FROM DISEASE MODELLING TO indiscernible ACTUALLY IN DEVELOPMENT , WITH CANADA 'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO DISCUSS , HOW CAN A.I. BE APPLIED TO ACCELERATE THE EFFORTS IN WINNING THIS WAR AGAINST COVID-19 . IT WAS QUITE AN AMAZING CALL AND I THINK A LOT OF VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS TOOK PLACE AND I HOPE A LOT OF INTERESTING ACTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE AS A RESULT OF THAT CONVERSATION YESTERDAY . <p> Steve says LET ME DO A FOLLOW-UP WITH YOU ON THAT , ALAN . I GUESS THERE 'S AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC HERE BETWEEN COLLABORATION AND COMPETITION . HOW MUCH OF EACH GOES ON RIGHT NOW ? <p> Alan says I WOULD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THINK THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO WORK TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY . EVERYBODY WANTS TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM . IT 'S A WAR WITH THIS VIRUS AND I THINK IT WOULD BE SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR A COMPANY OR AN ACADEMIC TO THINK ABOUT COMPETING WITH A COLLEAGUE OR SOMEBODY FROM ANOTHER UNIVERSITY OR COUNTRY . INDEED , WE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION YESTERDAY ABOUT , HOW DO WE OPEN UP DATA-SHARING IN COMPANIES , IN UNIVERSITIES , IN PUBLIC HEALTH UNITS AROUND THE WORLD SO THAT WE 'RE ALL GETTING ALL THE DATA IN REALTIME BECAUSE , AS THE W.H.O. HAS BEEN EMPHASIZING IT 'S ABOUT TESTING , TESTING , TESTING AND DATA , DATA , DATA . WE NEED THE DATA TO MOVE FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE . <p> Steve says SURE . WOULD ANY OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU GLEANED 17 YEARS AGO DURING THE SARS OUTBREAK HERE IN ONTARIO , WOULD ANY OF THAT BE USEFUL TO YOUR EFFORTS TODAY ? <p> Alan says I THINK WE 'VE LEARNED A HECK OF A LOT FROM THE SARS OUTBREAK OF 2003 , AND THE SCIENCE HAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM ROB , THE CHAIN REACTION WHICH AMPLIFIED THE DNA AND ALLOWED THE VIRUS TO GROW AND THE BASIS OF THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST CURRENTLY , THAT DID N'T EXIST IN 2003 . THE SEQUENCING BACK THEN TOOK WEEKS AND WEEKS . TODAY IT TOOK A FEW DAYS . IT 'S AN UNDERGRADUATE EXERCISE AT A UNIVERSITY . IN ADDITION , OF COURSE , WE NOW HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN CANADA THAT WE DID NOT HAVE IN 2003 , AND THAT 'S BEEN CRITICAL IN TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC . <p> Steve says ROB , LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT A WORD THAT I SUSPECT PEOPLE WATCHING THIS OR LISTENING TO THIS RIGHT NOW HAD NEVER HEARD OF AS RECENTLY AS THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO , AND THAT WORD IS CHLOROQUINE . CHLOROQUINE IS APPARENTLY THE NAME OF A DRUG THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IN A BRIEFING JUST THE OTHER DAY MENTIONED COULD BE USEFUL TO GETTING RID OF COVID-19 , AND APPARENTLY A COUPLE IN THEIR 60s IN ARIZONA TOOK IT , HAVING LISTENED TO THE PRESIDENT FOR THEIR MEDICAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAN I INFER FROM THIS THAT YOU AGREE THAT IT 'S PROBABLY NOT A GREAT IDEA TO TAKE YOUR MEDICAL ADVICE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE MOMENT ? <p> Robert says YOU KNOW , I ALWAYS TAKE MY MEDICAL ADVICE FROM TRUSTED CLINICIANS . I 'M FORTUNATE TO WORK WITH A NUMBER OF GREAT ONES HERE AT SUNNYBROOK AND I THINK IT 'S IMPORTANT FOR DECISIONS TO BE MADE BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE . SO WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN PROPERLY CONTROLLED STUDIES AND TRIALS AND THAT SHOULD REALLY BE USED TO INFORM HOW PATIENTS ARE MANAGED AND TREATED . <p> Steve says ALAN , I 'D LIKE TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT I GUESS THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT HERE . WHAT WAS HE ... THIS IS A HARD QUESTION ... BUT WHAT WAS HE THINKING IN SUGGESTING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SOLUTION AROUND THIS DRUG ? <p> Alan says YOU 'D HAVE TO ASK HIM , STEVE . <p> LAUGHTER <p> Steve says BUT DOES CHLOROQUINE HAVE PROPERTIES THAT , TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE , MIGHT BE USEFUL IN THIS SITUATION ? <p> Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROB JUST SAID , THIS WILL BE SETTLED BY CLINICAL TRIAL , A PROPERLY DESIGNED CLINICAL TRIAL BY TRAINED CLINICIANS WHO UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO TRIALS . IT WO N'T BE SETTLED AT A PRESS CONFERENCE BY ANYBODY . <p> Steve says ROB , HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT TRYING TO FIND AN EXISTING DRUG , IF THERE IS ONE , THAT MIGHT PROVIDE SOME RELIEF ? <p> Robert says WELL , THERE 'S A NUMBER OF STEPS . THE FIRST STEP WILL OBVIOUSLY BE TO DO IT IN CELL CULTURE AND IN ANIMAL MODELS . YOU 'LL WANT TO SEE THAT IT HAS AN EFFECT , PREVENTING THE VIRUS FROM REPLICATING OR KILLING THE VIRUS IN THESE MODELS AND NOT MAKING THE ANIMALS , FOR EXAMPLE , MORE SICK . WE 'RE AT A BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE IF WE USE DRUGS THAT ARE ALREADY LICENSED BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE SAFE IN HUMANS . REALLY , THE CRITICAL THING IS YOU NEED GOOD CLINICAL TRIALS , AS I SAID , RUN BY PHYSICIANS WHO CAN MONITOR EVERYTHING , SIDE EFFECTS , DETERMINE THINGS LIKE DOSING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT 'S SOMETHING THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT RUSH . <p> Steve says HMM . ALAN , HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU , BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THESE MATTERS , THAT THERE IS SOMETHING OUT THERE IN EXISTENCE NOW THAT COULD BE HELPFUL ? <p> Alan says I DO N'T THINK WE KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION . I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL MAJOR INITIATIVES , AGAIN , WHICH WE DISCUSSED YESTERDAY ON THIS ZOOM CALL , OF LOOKING AT LIBRARIES OF THOUSANDS OF COMPOUNDS AND THOUSANDS OF DRUGS , COMBINING IT WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE , TO LOOK FOR A POTENTIAL CANDIDATES WHICH MIGHT BE USEFUL AGAINST THIS VIRUS AND BE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE IN HUMANS . SO THAT 'S KIND OF A PRE-SCREENING TO ACCELERATE THE SEARCH FOR A USEFUL DRUG . THE OTHER APPROACH , WHICH IS TO LOOK AT THE GENOME OF THE VIRUS AND IDENTIFY THE GENES AND THEN USE SORT OF WHAT IS NOW SORT OF TARGETED TRADITIONAL DRUG DEVELOPMENT , LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROTEINS THAT 'S ENCODED FOR BY THOSE GENES AND CAN WE DEVELOP A DRUG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFFECT THEIR FUNCTION . THAT 'S GOING TO TAKE LONGER BUT IT WO N'T TAKE AS LONG AS IT USED TO , THE OPTIMISTIC VIEW . AND SO THERE 'S A LOT OF EFFORTS , BOTH IN DRUG COMPANIES AND MY TEAM ANNOUNCED A MAJOR EFFORT IN THAT REGARD , THE GROUP AT THE CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO THAT 'S USING A.I. AND CHEMISTRY TO DO THAT . SO THERE 'S A LOT OF REALLY SMART PEOPLE WHO ARE APPLYING STATE-OF-THE-ART SCIENCE TO DO EXACTLY WHAT WE ALL WANT , WHICH IS TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DRUG . AND WITH THAT , STEVE , I 'M GOING TO HAVE TO SIGN OFF BECAUSE I HAVE ANOTHER ZOOM CALL , I 'VE GOT TO BE ON . I APOLOGIZE . <p> Steve says NOT AT ALL . PLEASE DO N'T APOLOGIZE . WE 'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE TIME YOU GAVE US . WE WENT A LITTLE OVER WHAT YOU SAID YOU COULD GIVE US . THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US AND WE 'LL TALK AGAIN DOWN THE ROAD , I HOPE . <p> Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BERNSTEIN FROM CIFAR , CANADIAN INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED RESEARCH . I WANT TO READ SOMETHING TO YOU NOW , ROB , IF I CAN , AND HAVE YOU COMMENT ON IT . THIS IS AN EXCERPT FROM A JUST-PUBLISHED BOOK ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY CALLED " PHARMA " AND WRITTEN BY GERALD POSNER AND HE HAS THIS TO SAY AND HE STARTS BY TALKING ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS SCIENTISTS IN AMERICA TODAY WHO MANY HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN . WELL , LET 'S GO . HERE WE GO ... <p> A quote appears on screen , under the title " The pharma speed bump . " The quote reads " Doctor Fauci and officials at other government and international health organizations know that any vaccine developed in a lab will ultimately be manufactured by large pharmaceutical firms .

March 2 , 2020 . <p> Steve says CAN I JUST GET , ROB , YOUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THAT EXCERPT ? <p> Robert says WELL , I SHOULD CAUTION , YOU 'RE TALKING WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS ON THE FRONT LINES , SO THAT 'S ... IT SEEMS LIKE A BIGGER ISSUE THAT PERHAPS POLICYMAKERS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MORE EXPERTISE IN . I MEAN , MY OWN PERSONAL FEELING , AND I HAVE COLLEAGUES WHO WORK IN BIG PHARMA AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES , I MEAN , I THINK FOR THIS , I DO N'T THINK ANYONE IS GOING TO SLOW DOWN OR PUT UNNECESSARY SPEED BUMPS IN DEVELOPMENT . I THINK THE WORLD WANTS ...

THAT MIGHT MAKE THE DISEASE MORE SEVERE OR MAY HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS , AND I THINK THAT ... I THINK BOTH SCIENTISTS AND PROBABLY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS . <p> Steve says I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER . BUT I WONDER IF IT 'S AN ISSUE INASMUCH AS , YOU KNOW , POTENTIALLY , IF A LIFE-SAVING DRUG IS FOUND HERE , IT 'S ONLY GOING TO BE NEEDED ONCE , AND THAT 'S IT . YOU KNOW , THIS COVID-19 PRESUMABLY WHEN THE NEXT PANDEMIC COMES , IT 'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING ELSE . AND WHATEVER YOU FIGURE OUT TO TREAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE NECESSARILY EFFECTIVE THE NEXT TIME AROUND . DO YOU THEREFORE HAVE TO INCENTIVIZE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS , GIVEN IT 'S ONE AND DONE , THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO DO IT ? <p> Robert says I DO N'T THINK WE KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE VIRUS TO SAY IT WILL NECESSARILY BE ... YOU NOW , WE DO N'T KNOW WHETHER IT WILL CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE . THERE 'S STILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I THINK THAT THERE ARE ... THERE ARE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT ARE CLEARLY INCENTIVIZED TO ADDRESS THESE PARTICULAR ... MORE ACUTE OUTBREAK PANDEMIC-TYPE PROBLEMS . YOU KNOW , THIS IS WHY WE HAVE QUITE A NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES RIGHT NOW PURSUING VACCINES , FOR EXAMPLE . I DO N'T KNOW IT 'S NECESSARILY SOMETHING WHERE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE N'T NECESSARILY ENGAGED AND INCENTIVIZED . I 'M SURE THEY COULD WORK WITH GOVERNMENTS AND THERE ARE COALITIONS , ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CEPI , FOR EXAMPLE , WHICH ARE WORKING TO PROGRESS THIS RESEARCH AND PUT MONEY INTO VACCINE DEVELOPMENT . SO I THINK IT 'S ENCOURAGING . I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS . IT 'S ALL JUST ABOUT FIGURING OUT WHAT THE RIGHT RECIPE WOULD BE . <p> Steve says OKAY . SPEAKING OF PARTNERSHIPS , LET ME FOLLOW UP ON SOMETHING WE TALKED WITH ALAN ABOUT WHEN HE WAS HERE EARLIER IN OUR CONVERSATION , AND THAT IS , HE SAID THERE WAS BASICALLY NO COMPETITION BUT TERRIFIC COLLABORATION AMONG ALL THE DIFFERENT INSTITUTES HERE IN CANADA TO GET TO THE FINISH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUST EXPAND ON THAT QUESTION BY ASKING : DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH COOPERATION AND-OR COMPETITION IS GOING ON AMONG CANADIAN LABS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL LABS AROUND THE WORLD ? <p> Robert says SO I THINK IN TERMS OF COOPERATION , I 'VE SEEN QUITE A BIT . AGAIN , FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXAMPLE , WHEN WE WERE LOOKING TO ISOLATE THE VIRUS , I WAS IN COMMUNICATION WITH A RESEARCH GROUP IN AUSTRALIA THAT WAS IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THE SAME THING , AND THEY WERE INCREDIBLY FORTHCOMING AND INCREDIBLY HELPFUL WITH SHARING TIPS AND POINTERS AND THINGS THAT THEY HAD DONE . SO I THINK THAT A LOT OF RESEARCHERS REALIZED THAT THIS IS NOT A CANADIAN PROBLEM . THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM UNIQUE TO ONE COUNTRY . SO BECAUSE IT 'S A GLOBAL PANDEMIC , EVERYBODY IS SHARING ... AND I THINK EVERYBODY REALIZES THAT THERE IS N'T JUST A NEED FOR ONE SOLUTION . SO THERE LIKELY WO N'T BE JUST ONE VACCINE , THERE MIGHT BE THREE OR FOUR VACCINES THAT WILL ALL WORK EQUALLY WELL . SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ULTIMATELY IT 'S ALWAYS BETTER TO COLLABORATE THAN COMPETE . <p> Steve says GOTCHA . LET 'S FINISH UP ON THIS . I WANT TO READ ONE MORE THING , AND ACTUALLY , COINCIDENTALLY , IT WAS SOMETHING ALAN BERNSTEIN WROTE 17 YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE WHOLE SARS EPIDEMIC . I GUESS THE TITLE ON HIS PIECE WAS " GET READY FOR THE NEXT SARS , " WHICH I GATHER IS WHAT WE 'RE IN RIGHT NOW . HERE 'S WHAT HE SAID IN THE GLOBE AND MAIL 17 YEARS AGO ... <p> Another quote appears on screen , under the title " In hindsight . " The quote reads " Newly emerging pathogens also pose unprecedented challenges for the research community . Just as it is too late to realize that we need front-line healthcare workers experienced in dealing with highly contagious pathogens , it is also too late by the time a new disease like SARS hits , to decide we need virologists , immunologists , epidemiologists , DNA sequencers and public health researchers . The average period of training for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a first university degree . It 's like deciding you need a fire department only after a fire breaks out . " Quoted from Alan Bernstein , The Globe and Mail . June 19 , 2003 . <p> Steve says CAN I GET YOU , ROB , TO WEIGH IN ON WHETHER THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY , THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY , DECISION-MAKERS AND SO ON , IN YOUR VIEW , HAVE LIVED UP TO THE WARNING THAT ALAN BERNSTEIN PUT ON THE RECORD 17 YEARS AGO ? <p> Robert says YOU KNOW , I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE SPECTRUM . SO THERE HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE FOLLOWED THAT AND HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF PREPARATORY WORK , WHO HAVE CONTINUED TO INVESTIGATE AND DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE ARE SEEING UTILIZED NOW . IS IT A QUESTION THAT WE COULD ALWAYS BE DOING MORE AND THAT THERE COULD BE MORE RESOURCES MADE AVAILABLE ? ABSOLUTELY . THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE , AS DR . BERNSTEIN RIGHTLY POINTS OUT , THIS WILL NOT BE THE LAST EMERGING PATHOGEN THAT WE SEE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME BECAUSE OF SARS , AND I HOPE THAT GOING FORWARD THAT IT WILL ... THAT THIS WILL SPUR GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO REALLY CONTINUE TO PUT THE RESEARCH AND THE RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR THIS GOING FORWARD . WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE .

Thank you . Please go ahead , sir . <p> Thank you , operator . Good afternoon , and welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Jason Shandell , President of Amphastar . I 'm joined today by our CFO , Bill Peters . We appreciate you joining us on the call today and look forward to speaking with you and answering any questions you may have . <p> As you can see from our financial results , Amphastar had a strong year and is in a position of operational and financial strength , driven by continued execution of our long-term strategy and focus on our key growth drivers and complex pipeline . <p> Our net revenues for 2019 increased by more than 9% to approximately $322 million and our gross profit increased more than 23% to approximately $132 million driven by strong sales of Primatene Mist and our critical care portfolio , which continues to show strong demand due to competitor shortages . <p> Net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $41.8 million . Gross margins also increased year-over-year from 36% to 41% , as Primatene Mist and our other high-margin products continue to increase as a percentage of our total sales . We expect this margin expansion trend to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments in research and development will allow us to deliver even greater value to patients and shareholders over the long term . <p> Since our last earnings call , I 'm happy to announce that the FDA has accepted 2 more ANDAs , which have GDUFA dates in the fourth quarter of 2020 . One of the ANDAs is for regadenoson , which is a generic of Lexiscan . This ANDA included a Paragraph IV certification , and we were sued by the brand sponsor , which triggered a 30-month stay . We now have 7 ANDAs on file with the agency , targeting products with a market size of approximately $1.9 billion based on IQVIA data for the 12 months ended December 31 , 2019 . <p> The strong momentum of Primatene Mist sales continues to increase at a greater rate as we launched the product into Walmart in November 2019 , and we continue to increase consumer awareness through our marketing strategies . As we discussed on the last earnings call , traditional television advertising has been extremely effective in building consumer awareness about Primatene Mist . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels and saw a very good return on investment . Therefore , beginning in January 2020 , we expanded airing of our commercials on the major broadcast networks , targeting prime yet cost-effective advertising slots with the national recognized TV shows , including Judge Judy , Dr. Phil , The Price Is Right and many other widely viewed programs . This strong advertising push , combined with an allergy season that arrived earlier due to the mild winter , resulted in very strong same-store sales across all of our retail partners . <p> Weekly store sales as of the last week of the fourth quarter of 2019 have increased by more than 140% compared to the first week of the third quarter 2019 , which was just before the TV ads began airing . We are very excited about the long-term prospects of this brand and are currently in discussions with other large potential retail partners . Based on the continued effectiveness of our advertising strategy and the continued positive trend in retail store sales , we maintain our guidance of Primatene Mist achieving an annual rate of revenue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products from our IMS facility to be another strong driver of revenues in 2020 . We recently issued a press release announcing that the FDA approved our supplemental ANDA for sodium bicarbonate , which is for manufacturing the product in our new state-of-the-art production line at IMS . This FDA approval further validates our strength in scaling up our manufacturing capabilities in response to increased demand for our products and greatly increases our manufacturing capacity at our IMS facility . Our recent approval will help us meet the high demand for our critical care injectable products and provide us with capacity for future pipeline products , which will be a source of significant revenues going forward . <p> With respect to our epinephrine 30-ml vial ANDA , we received a minor CRL in January 2020 and responded to the agency in 1 business day . As a result , we have a GDUFA date in the second quarter of 2020 and are confident that we will receive approval . Regarding our complex injectable product , which has been through 3 review cycles of the agency , we received the CRL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 . As a result , we have a new GDUFA date in Q3 or Q4 2020 , depending if another pre-approval inspection is needed . <p> As we discussed on our last earnings call , we have another ANDA on file with the FDA for a very complex injectable product that is off-patent and has never had generic competition due to its complexity . We had a productive mid-cycle review meeting with the agency earlier this year and have a GDUFA date for this product in the second quarter 2020 . <p> With respect to our insulin programs , our first human clinical trials using our insulin began in Q4 2019 and is ongoing . Based on recent FDA guidance and direct communications with the agency , we remain hopeful that our strong analytical tools , including characterization of complex molecules , will result in the FDA determining that immunogenicity studies would not be required . This determination would save significant time and expenses , thereby allowing us to enter the market sooner than previously expected . Furthermore , based on recent FDA guidance and the purity of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve interchangeable status for our insulin products . <p> Turning to our intranasal naloxone NDA . We have a meeting with the agency scheduled for later this month . The purpose of this meeting is to confirm with the agency that we 've addressed all of the issues identified in the CRL and FDA 's general advice letters . If the agency agrees that we 've addressed all issues , we could resubmit the NDA this year . <p> Finally , I would like to address the impact of the coronavirus on Amphastar . At this time , over 99% of the labor force in our China facility has returned to work , and thankfully , none of our employees have contracted the virus . Furthermore , our supply chain is well intact as we had previously built up significant inventory of starting material and API from China as we strategically planned for potential disruptions related to trade negotiations and the African swine flu . As a result of these planning efforts , we have at least 2 years inventory of starting material and API located in our California facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. Furthermore , it should be emphasized that Amphastar manufactures all of our finished products in the United States , which further insulates the company 's commercial operations from supply disruptions related to global instability . <p> I will now turn the call over to Bill to go through the fourth quarter financial results . <p> Thank you , Jason . Sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased 7% to $83.4 million from $89.7 million in the previous year 's period . Importantly , Primatene Mist achieved a very strong sales of $9 million as we loaded our product nationally into Walmart and had large orders from all of the other national drugstore chains . Enoxaparin sales dropped to $8.8 million in the fourth quarter from $19.1 million in the prior year 's fourth quarter as a market shortage in 2018 resulted in a temporary surge in enoxaparin sales last year . <p> Gross margins improved to 40% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 from 39% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to sales of higher-margin products such as Primatene Mist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million from $2.6 million on television and radio expenses for marketing Primatene Mist . General and administrative spending decreased 24% to $10.5 million from $13.8 million primarily due to decreased legal expenses since we settled our lawsuit with Momenta and Sandoz in June of 2019 . Research and development expenditures increased 17% to $19.6 million from $16.7 million due to increased clinical trial expenses for inhalation products and increased expenses associated with API development at our Amphastar Nanjing Pharmaceuticals subsidiary . <p> The company reported a net loss of $1 million or $0.02 per share compared to last year 's fourth quarter net income of $1.9 million or $0.04 per share . The company reported adjusted net income of $3.6 million or $0.07 per share compared to an adjusted net income of approximately $6.2 million or $0.13 per share in the fourth quarter of last year . Adjusted earnings include -- or exclude amortization , equity compensation , impairments and onetime events . <p> In the fourth quarter , we had cash flows provided by operations of approximately $5.7 million . During the quarter , the company repurchased approximately $13.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to over $22 million . <p> Let me review a few of the financial assumptions that we are using as we look to 2020 . We expect sales growth to be driven by Primatene Mist and 1 or 2 ANDAS , which may be approved later this year . Our sales have already gotten a boost this year from the approval of the supplemental ANDA for sodium bicarbonate , which effectively increases the capacity for prefilled syringes , many of which are in drug shortage by allowing us to manufacture in our newly modernized facility . We have already begun shipping product from this new room and believe that the sales opportunity for these shortage products is approximately $20 million annually . We expect additional sales growth to come from our ANP subsidiary . Last year , we booked $1.5 million in third-party sales from our ANP business . And at this time , we believe that sales from this facility will more than double in 2020 . We expect gross margins to increase as we sell more of our high-margin Primatene Mist , and we anticipate higher margins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense will rise as we plan to increase our advertising for Primatene Mist . However , the advertising expense will decrease as a percentage of Primetime Mist sales to provide earnings leverage . We expect G&amp;A spending to decrease as a percentage of sales due to lower spending on legal matters . We expect research and development spending will continue to increase in both dollar terms and as a percentage of sales , as we currently have 2 inhalation and 1 insulin clinical trials ongoing , and we continue to increase the R&amp;D work at our ANP facility . <p> I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions and answers . <p> And then for epinephrine vials , I think you had previously indicated , we could get a response from the FDA by the end of April . Is that still the expectation ? And then if approved , how should we think about that potential market opportunity and the market share you 're targeting ? <p> Sure . So yes , we 've said that we have a GDUFA date for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of that minor CRL . And so when you do the math , that does come out to April . And in terms of market opportunity , we believe that we will be the sole generic and should have a reasonable share of the market . <p> What we 've said so far is that we had $9 million in sales in the fourth quarter . Just under $2 million of that was stocking for Walmart , and we expect significant growth this year , and we 're targeting our goal of the run rate of $65 million next year . So those are the parameters we 've given . <p> Yes . So with those parameters , the $9 million in the fourth quarter , and as I said in my prepared remarks that we just started airing on network television commercials beginning just in January . So with the Walmart launch and the push into mainstream television , we think that the growth will continue at the rate that we 've seen . <p> Two questions . You mentioned the ramp-up in DTC , a national TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon ? Or is it just this quarter ? And related to that , it looks like you 've done about $10 million in SG&amp;A each of the last 2 quarters . With this ramp up , should we expect kind of higher quarterly run rates in SG&amp;A ? And then secondly , you mentioned you have the 2 GDUFA dates this year for these large multiple $100 million branded products that do n't currently have generic . Can you give us a little more color on the timing of the current GDUFA dates as you know them ? <p> Sure . So in terms of the advertising push , yes , I think we do want to continue this throughout the year . The return on investment has been really good , and we think it will continue . And again , as I was saying in my prepared remarks that although it is the broadcast TV and national television , it 's still very cost-effective . So we 're targeting the prime yet cost-effective advertising slots . So we will continue with that . And in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes . So we have our -- we break out our G&amp;A from our selling , so the selling , distribution or marketing line . You 've seen some significant growth in that . And that growth is really all advertising for Primatene Mist . And as I said earlier , we are going to grow that -- those dollars relative this year . However , as a percentage of sales of Primatene Mist that will drop . So we will get earnings leverage on that . <p> And then in terms of the 2 undisclosed complex injectable products without generic competition , the first one that we 've been talking about for quite a while now , that 's the one that 's been through 3 review cycles . And we did a pretty fast turnaround . On the last call , we had talked about getting the CRL in the fourth quarter . And at that point , we were just assessing it , and we felt confident that it was very addressable . And we predicted that we would respond in January , which we di
