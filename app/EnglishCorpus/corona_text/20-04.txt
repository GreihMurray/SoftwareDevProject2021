Find the collection here . <p> Around the year 1600 , the weather in much of Europe substantially cooled , in the latter phase of what has been called the Little Ice Age . In all , it lasted 300 years . Winters were brutally cold and summers were damp and chilly , greatly curtailing the growing season . Crops failed . People starved . But the change in weather forced English , French , and Dutch fishermen to build improved boats , capable of following fish farther to the west and surviving long trips through the rough seas . Undoubtedly , some of that new boat-building craft led to the ships of today . <p> Innovation often arises in periods of adversity . In recent weeks , we have seen such welcome invention germinating in the horrendous crisis of the coronavirus . Consider , for example , the many new platforms for online teaching , or the use of cheap Bluetooth smart thermometers able to transmit a person 's fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Toronto Symphony Orchestra performing together and apart from 29 different locations using their smartphones . <p> In bad times , innovation can occur in habits of mind as well as in new technologies . The frightening COVID-19 pandemic may be creating such a change now -- by forcing many of us to slow down , to spend more time in personal reflection , away from the noise and heave of the world . With more quiet time , more privacy , more stillness , we have an opportunity to think about who we are , as individuals and as a society . <p> Habits of mind and lifestyle do not change easily . Without noticing , we slowly slip into the routines of our lives , like becoming so accustomed to living on a noisy street that we can not remember our previous neighborhood and a time of silence .

That speed rose to about 1,000 bits a second in the mid-1980s with the advent of the internet . Today , the rate is 1,000,000,000 bits a second . The resulting increase in productivity in the workplace , coupled with the time-equals-money equation , has led to our acute awareness of the commercial and goal-oriented uses of time . <p> As a result , we have created a frenzied lifestyle in which not a minute is to be wasted .

The mind needs to rest . The mind needs periods of calm . Such a need has been recognized for thousands of years . It was described as early as 1500 B.C. , in the meditation traditions of Hinduism . Later in Buddhism . An ancient passage from the Buddhist Dhammapada reads : " When a monk has gone into an empty place and has calmed his mind , he experiences a delight that transcends that of other men .

In a 2007 clinical report for the American Academy of Pediatrics , the physician Kenneth R. Ginsburg wrote that " play allows children to use their creativity while developing their imagination , dexterity , and physical , cognitive , and emotional strength .

My inner self roots me to me , and to the ground beneath me . The sunlight and soil that nourish my inner self are solitude and personal reflection . When I listen to my inner self , I hear the breathing of my spirit . Those breaths are so tiny and delicate , I need stillness to hear them , I need slowness to hear them .

If citizens of this nation , like me , have lost something of our own inner selves , then what of the nation as a whole ? If our nation can not listen to its inner self , how can it listen to others ? If our nation can not grant itself true inner freedom , how can it allow freedom for others ?

( Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) <p> An immunology and molecular biologist pioneer who grew up here and now works in California hailed the news that some of the sickest Covid-19 patients at local hospitals began receiving an experimental treatment led by a researcher from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center . <p> " Nice to see Buffalo on the cutting edge , " said Andy Blidy , who grew up on the West Side and in Evans . <p> Blidy voiced great hopes for the trial , in which health providers at three hospitals will administer sarilumab , a monoclonal antibody against a protein that can worsen symptoms for those whose novel coronavirus has reached the critical stage in the ICU . <p> He moved to Boston in the 1980s to do graduate work at Tufts Medical School with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Francisco region , diagnostics for HIV at BD Monoclonal Center and Applied Biosystems on the Human Genome Project . <p> Sarilumab and tocilizumab are both biologic medications given by injection to dial back inflammation for those with rheumatoid arthritis , easing swelling and joint pain . <p> They do so by supressing the free flow of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , a protein that in the lungs can supercharge inflammation and dramatically lower oxygen levels for the sickest of Covid-19 patients . <p> Dr. Igor Puzanov , director of the Early Phase Clinical Trials Program and chief of melanoma services at Roswell Park , leads the new trial .

Nationwide , over 186,000 people have tested positive for the virus and more than 4,000 have died , according to a count by Johns Hopkins University . <p> Cuomo said Tuesday that in New York state 2,710 patients were currently in the state 's intensive care units and nearly 300 had to be intubated and put on ventilators . <p> According to medical experts , the normal standard of care for a ventilated patient includes around-the-clock care from a team of nurses and respiratory therapists , under the supervision of an intensive care doctor . <p> Now , due to the influx of patients needing ICU care , one ICU doctor may now manage four times the number of ventilated patients they normally do , with a team of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strained system that could buckle even further if large numbers of front-line nurses and doctors contract the coronavirus due to shortages of personal protective equipment . <p> " This will likely result in a lower quality of care , and it 's why the standard of care changes in an emergency , " said White . " Critical care physicians are trained in respiratory and multi-organ failure in a way that no other specialty is . " <p> When those physicians are transitioned from being directly involved to now managing a group of non-ICU doctors , it changes the care the patient gets , he said . <p> Dr. Greg Martin with the Society of Critical Care Medicine , a professional organization devoted to the care of the most critical patients , said it 's hard to project which workforce of the three -- doctors , nurses and respiratory therapists -- will be the first to become stretched .

Patients sometimes also require paralytic drugs to loosen up their vocal cords and other muscles to prevent damage when the breathing tube is inserted . <p> Patients continue to receive sedatives and pain relievers to keep them asleep while intubated , to prevent their bodies from fighting against both the breathing tube and the ventilator , which performs breathing functions for patients to allow their own lungs to heal . <p> With many COVID-19 patients requiring ventilators for weeks , some health officials are worried that the nation 's supply of necessary drugs wo n't be enough to help the country weather a prolonged and sustained outbreak across multiple cities and states . <p> Dr. Erin Fox , who tracks and investigates drug shortages reported from hospitals around the country , told ABC News that some of the most commonly used drugs to intubate and maintain a patient on ventilator are running in short supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way , and we do n't see a tsunami of drug availability coming our way .

@@31755841 <p> Staffers of former presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg are staring down the possibility of losing their jobs and health care in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic . <p> When he joined the race last year , the billionaire said he would employ his campaign staff through the November election , even if he were n't the nominee . But Bloomberg dropped out after a poor showing on Super Tuesday , and he has since fired staffers in multiple waves . His campaign had announced earlier in March that it would launch an independent expenditure group to take on Trump that would employ former campaign staffers in swing states . <p> Instead of creating his own organization in swing states , Bloomberg 's campaign said on Friday , he will donate $18 million to the Democratic National Committee -- allowing the party to potentially hire organizers themselves . <p> That means many Bloomberg organizers are out of a job . Organizers in six swing states were informed this morning that they were being let go and given instructions for applying to the DNC . <p> " He 's chopping his employees in a pandemic , " said one staffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had signed a nondisclosure agreement . " My life is now uprooted and I 'm effectively homeless . " <p> Another staffer in North Carolina said he and many other former campaign employees were " completely blindsided " by the news on Friday that they were losing their jobs . <p> " It 's fucking scary , " he said of the thought of staffers losing health care in the middle of the pandemic . <p> A Bloomberg campaign spokesperson said that staffers in the six battleground states who were supposed to be part of the former candidate 's now-aborted group " will be employed and paid through the first week in April and have full benefits through the end of April . " <p> The Florida staffer , who had previously been on Medicaid , moved to a swing state on the promise of a stable , well-paying job through November . Without their own place to live , the staffer said , they planned to stay with family to wait out the coronavirus outbreak . <p> Bloomberg had already broken a promise of employment through November to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his three-month presidential campaign , on which he spent a record $687 million of his personal fortune . Staffers who were not in swing states were let go earlier this month . <p> But at the time , said the Florida staffer , they were still under the impression they would be employed by a Bloomberg campaign entity . " We got the message , ' Hey do n't worry , you guys are fine . ' " <p> The Bloomberg spokesperson said staffers were being encouraged to apply to work for the DNC : " The DNC Coordinated Campaign is hiring in every one of the six battleground states we identified -- and more . And we will assist the DNC as much as we are able to , including by providing names of staff and working to help them onboard and grow their program as expediently as possible . " <p> Staffers in swing states learned they were being let go on a call on Friday morning by campaign states director Dan Kanninen and human resources representative Katherine Sayers . According to a script for the call , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DNC instead of creating an independent expenditure group , saying a separate group " would simply not be as effective or efficient in our goal of defeating Donald Trump in November . " <p> " We want as many of the organizing team from Mike2020 as possible to join the DNC 's effort -- and we have designed a structure to facilitate the process for those who express interest , " Kanninen said , according to the call script . <p> Employees learned they had five days to apply for DNC jobs in order to be considered . Sayers , the HR representative , told them to fill out a Google Form no later than March 25 , even if they had " previously noted interest in future opportunities as part of your off-boarding last week . " <p> The Google Form will not guarantee Bloomberg staffers a job with the DNC . Instead , their information will be " fed into a competitive hiring process , " Sayers told staffers on the phone call , " and you will hear from the DNC on that process and next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire and onboard their new staff as expediently as possible . " <p> " There will be an application process , " the DNC official said on Friday . " Bloomberg organizers can apply . " <p> The DNC official declined to say exactly how many jobs will open as a result of the transfer but said the $18 million will allow the party to hire " hundreds " of new organizers for its existing " Battleground Build-Up 2020 " program , which funds offices and field organizers across 12 states that will be critical in the general election . <p> $18 million marks a significant influx of cash for the DNC . <p> The Democratic Party routinely lags in fundraising behind the GOP , with Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee bringing in more than $100 million last quarter . Joe Biden , the candidate best positioned to clinch the Democratic nomination this summer , is still in the midst of professionalizing his field and fundraising programs for the general election . <p> Bloomberg previously discussed spending up to $1 billion of his own money to help defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bloomberg campaign leadership had made the choice not to create a separate independent expenditure organization or super PAC , a move that may limit his spending in the future . <p> The $18 million transfer , a small fraction of what he 's discussed spending in the past , is the first money Bloomberg has publicly pledged since dropping out of the race two weeks ago . <p> " There are good people out there that left their jobs behind to go work for a candidate that honestly most of us did n't believe in the first place , " said the former staffer in Florida . " We did it for the necessity . We did it for the job security . "

The world 's appetite for energy has been massively hit since the outbreak of novel coronavirus . With 3 billion people in lockdown , International Energy Agency ( IEA ) reckons global oil demand will witness a drop of 20% in the near future . Further , the fallout between Russia and Saudi Arabia has resulted in a supply glut of crude oil and sparked off a relentless price war , depressing prices further and hurting the global energy industry . <p> Top oil and gas giants offer stable dividend payouts , a strategy to maintain the appeal of the stock among investors . However , as the world fights a pandemic , top energy companies will have to reassess their payout strategies , either by slowing down share buybacks or reintroducing non-cash dividends . <p> Re-modelling of Strategies a Pressing Priority <p> Many oil companies had cut expenses during the 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including booming U.S. shale oil production and shifting OPEC policies .

It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face . <h> What makes this outbreak so different ? <p> Unlike the flu , there is no known treatment or vaccine , and little is known about this particular virus so far . It seems to be more lethal than the flu , but the numbers are still uncertain .

They should give you advice on whether you should be tested , how to get tested , and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others . <h> What if somebody in my family gets sick ? <p> If the family member does n't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home , you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms , while also keeping as much distance as possible , according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there 's space , the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom . If masks are available , both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room .

The W.H.O. and C.D.C. say that unless you 're already sick , or caring for someone who is , wearing a face mask is n't necessary . The New York Times and other news outlets have been reporting that the wearing of face masks may not help healthy people , noting that while masks can help prevent the spread of a virus if you are infected , most surgical masks are too loose to prevent inhalation of the virus and the more effective N95 masks , because of shortages at health centers worldwide , should be used only by medical personnel . But researchers are also finding that there are more cases of asymptomatic transmission than were known early on in the pandemic . And a few experts say that masks could offer some protection in crowded places where it is not possible to stay 6 feet away from other people . Masks do n't replace hand-washing and social distancing . <h> Should I stock up on groceries ? <p> Plan two weeks of meals if possible .

@@31759441 <p> Slate is making its coronavirus coverage free for all readers . Subscribe to support our journalism . Start your free trial . <p> On Tuesday night , New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo quietly introduced legislative text for the state budget that would completely reverse the state 's new bail reform law , which has only been in effect since Jan. 1 . If Cuomo succeeds in rolling back bail reform , he would not only exacerbate the coronavirus pandemic by ensuring that tens of thousands more people would be jailed this year , but he would also likely doom the closure of the Rikers Island jail complex , which hinged on bail reform reducing the jail population . <p> The death of Kalief Browder , a teenager who spent about three years incarcerated at Rikers , helped push New York lawmakers to eliminate cash bail for a wide range of offenses in April 2019 . After the bail reform law passed , Cuomo called it " the most historic criminal justice reform in modern history in the state . " But starting in December , law enforcement started raising alarms about " dangerous repeat offenders " flooding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fearmongering campaign . <p> Currently , New York 's law prohibits cash bail for almost all misdemeanors and nonviolent felony offenses . To be clear , the existing law still allows judges to incarcerate thousands of people awaiting trial ; it preserves cash bail and pretrial detention for people accused of felonies . But the new proposed language would be far worse than the status quo under existing bail reform law . While the proposal would completely eliminate cash bail , it would also dramatically expand judges ' ability to " remand " defendants , or to detain them indefinitely before their trial without due process protections . <p> The governor 's proposal also permits pretrial detention for a much wider range of offenses and allows judges to make guesses about the future " dangerousness " of a defendant ( the likelihood that they will commit a new violent crime ) based on the " weight of the evidence , " which flouts the presumption of innocence before a case goes to trial . Additionally , New York law has never permitted judges to consider " dangerousness " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dangerousness standard " in New York law would lead to unprecedented levels of pretrial incarceration . <p> Finally , the proposal seemingly creates a new detention eligibility category for " persistent offenders , " or people who commit additional felony or Class A misdemeanor offenses while awaiting trial . " Remanding people for misdemeanors is something that has never been done in New York . The proposal would put vast numbers of people charged with low-level misdemeanors at risk of indefinite pretrial detention with no possibility of release , " said Scott Levy , chief policy counsel for the Bronx Defenders . The " persistent offender " category specifically includes crimes involving " harm to property . " For example , someone accused of two shoplifting offenses could be remanded under the proposed rollbacks . <p> Someone accused of two shoplifting offenses could be detained under the proposedrollbacks . <p> Together , these changes may well result in more New Yorkers detained pretrial for longer amounts of time than ever before . According to an analysis by FWD.us shared with Slate , the governor 's proposal would cause tens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would not be incarcerated under current law . While the unfairness of cash bail would be eliminated from this equation , the new system would preserve the existing structure of coercive plea bargaining that distorts justice by extorting criminal convictions from legally innocent people who are detained pretrial . <p> Cuomo 's insistence on bail reform rollbacks is particularly egregious given that New York is currently the epicenter of America 's coronavirus crisis -- and rollbacks will ensure that thousands of New Yorkers circulate through city jails in 2020 who would otherwise remain free awaiting trial . <p> New York City jails may actually be the most dangerous place in America as far as the coronavirus is concerned . On Wednesday , the Guardian reported that almost 180 people incarcerated at Rikers and 141 corrections staff were infected with the coronavirus . The infection rate in New York City jails is more than seven times higher than the rate for all New York City residents and at least 75 times higher than the rate for all Americans . Rikers does have an infectious disease unit with 88 beds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the jail 's chief physician estimates that about 20 percent of incarcerated people with the virus will need hospitalization , and 5 percent will need ventilators . Incarcerated people are also fundamentally unable to practice social distancing ; one incarcerated woman told NY1 that dormitory beds were n't even 6 feet apart . <p> Bail reform rollbacks would also create an enormous obstacle to New York City 's plan of closing jails on Rikers Island and constructing four replacement jails located near borough courthouses . The current plan , which the City Council approved in October , relies on a projected New York City jail population of 3,300 by 2026 . On March 31 , there were 4,604 people incarcerated in city jails , the lowest New York City jail population in decades . The city acknowledged that bail and parole reform are necessary to reduce the population to 3,300 ; in other words , if Cuomo rolls back bail reform , it 's unclear whether jails on Rikers Island would actually close in 2026 as the city projected . <p> If the city did choose to close Rikers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that elected officials would increase the size of the planned borough jails , which would mean that the city is spending $11 billion to increase carceral capacity . No New Jails NYC organizers ( including myself ) sounded the alarm about this months before the council voted on the jail construction proposal , noting that the Rikers closure plan is not legally binding and relies on the discretion of a future mayor and council . Even so , it 's not actually clear that the current mayor is invested in closing Rikers or further reducing the jail population . Mayor Bill de Blasio called for bail reform rollbacks just two days after the new bail reform law went into effect , and even spent time in Albany lobbying for changes . <p> Ultimately , the reversal of New York 's bail reform law will ensure that thousands of New Yorkers are exposed to a deadly virus while New York 's hospitals are drastically overburdened . The legislature should reject the governor 's callous effort to ramp up incarceration . <p> For more on the impact of the coronavirus , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

The officers will continue to be paid , are expected to be fit for duty and must report to their station ready to be deployed within 90 minutes of being asked to . <p> Police took from lessons learned by other police forces that have already seen the worst of the pandemic wave , Sloly says . <p> " One of the clear indications that we got from other police leaders is that ... they had n't really considered how to secure the frontline itself .

Sloly says police developed the plan in consultation with the police board and both police associations . <p> He stressed the landscape is changing day-to-day and that this plan , which could also change , gives police the chance to " preserve enough resources of frontline officers to be able to respond to the steady stream of calls coming in and any other surge issue that might come in . " <p> But the staffing plan does raise questions for some officers , including what will happen to specialty investigative skills needed during the pandemic . In the last week alone , police have continued to investigate domestic violence , a stabbing and shooting , and have continued to seize crime guns . The units from which officers are re-deployed will still need to be staffed to be able to function , they say .

He also maintained a commitment to communicate with officers as best as the service can . <p> " The entire organization , every member of the organization is committed to this , " he said . " But equally every member of the organization has concerns . They have concerns with their personal health , with their family 's health , concerns for their ability to provide policing in these unprecedented , dynamic and ever-changing times .

It sounds like a good deal , until you realize that while Grubhub is promoting the offer on behalf on restaurants , it 's also contractually forcing those business owners to eat the cost of that discount for every eligible order . ( Disclosure : my parents are restaurant owners that list their business on Grubhub / Seamless . ) <p> Under Grubhub 's Supper for Support program terms and conditions , the fine print says that while restaurants must opt into the program , they also have to agree to fund the $10 discounts -- or roughly 30 percent off the cost of one order if the customer just meets the $30 minimum .

Restaurants have been forced by these measures to indefinitely close or to reduce their service to takeout and delivery only . To continue operating , businesses have had to rely on online services like Grubhub , Doordash , Caviar , Postmates , and UberEats to assist with orders and deliveries , although many restaurants are urging customers to help them avoid fees by ordering direct .

I will be glad to watch them crumble apart , it is a result of their own arrogant stupidity . <p> Agree , seems like it 's mainly the old school talkback listeners who are baying for blood . It 's a crisis time and he had a silly error of judgment . But it 's a crisis time and he 's no Collins and Oravida , suggesting serious ethical issues . <p> Brains are all very well but a double edged sword if the attitude is wrong . Whenever I employed an individual I would take a good attitude as the first priority . Simply because a good attitude would learn and try to overcome any deficiencies whereas you get someone with brains and a bad attitude it can get to be diabolical . Your comment on Dr Cullen is interesting in that it goes some way in that regard . I was at the same school and he was dux . Undoubtedly he is of considerable intelligence . Despite that he stooped to some of the most outlandish gutter sniping imaginable calling one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance . <p> He accepted a scholarship at a private school and did very well with it . He then turned on the school saying he had ripped of the rich farmers in paying for his education and now that he was in parliament he would get into them again . Did n't come across that until years later . I was saddened more than surprised . Something rather vindictive , spiteful there in my opinion . <p> In part there is some merit to your position , but how long would it take someone else to step up into the position and get their head around all the facets of it ? Does he have a deputy ? Who is it ? And how capable are they ? <p> Clark was a pompous ass with religious overtones . Chose to know better ( pers com ) . The arrogance may have rubbed off from Hodgson , who is heading the hospital build ( a very old Labour approach to the world , circa Nordmeyer ) . <p> Both have heard the Limits to Growth problem , neither have addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different opinion ' . Which made him a wasted space in the near term . As was Curran . But we must remember that National are even worse in this regard . <p> She already has a lot on her plate , and I 'd suggest limited if any capacity to take on more , especially in her role as PM . Leaders ca n't do everything , and one of the hardest lessons to learn as a leader ( not a manager ) is delegation . It is too easy to criticise from the benches . <p> It is clear to see that Jacinda does n't take the lead there are very few that can do anything . Cut the Greens free for a start , they could n't brainstorm , organize and deliver a pizza . Get people who can proform , Jacinda was out of her debth from the very start and she 's going in deeper . Jacinda needs to learn how to sack people who do not deliver . Bring your bag with you if you come with a failure to deliver because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sack anyone . Just remember that she is only Prime Minister because Bill English refused to compromise his and National 's principles to accommodate Winston . She has a very limited and compromised mandate . This makes her job very difficult . Refer to Kiwibuild , CGT etc . She can not impose herself on anyone because if she falls out with a very few people , her government falls . <p> Yes , who could they use ? Need someone that is a Dr but not one that will outshine Jacinda so that rules out Liz Craig - Doctor , public health physician and former " Director of the NZ Child and Youth Epidemiology Service and spent over a decade monitoring the health of NZ 's children and young people . " Liz could n't even make it on Epidemic Response Committee . No wonder Jacinda was running around telling people you could n't get C19 from people without symptoms . <p> Mere distractions from the fact we are in no way prepared to come out of level 4 . No plan for the national distribution of face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No clear discussion on business operating protocols . NZ govt and media asleep at the wheel as precious time is squandered . <p> Given where we are on the Limits to Growth graph ( get informed if you ai n't ) your ' precious time ' has indeed been squandered . But by BAU , including business . <p> This may well trigger the needed bigger debate , but few politicians of any hue will be up to what is needed . This is beyond ideology , all angles of which are flawed , Oddly enough ( coming from someone like me ) I 'd suggest the pragmatism of Key would be useful ( whereas the dogmatism of Joyce most definitely would not ) . You have to realise that ' coming out ' and ' back to normal ' are based on misassumptions . <p> Yes PDK it 's obvious , but Rome did n't collapse in a decade . The complexity/corruption keeping the current system afloat is truly awesome , underestimate it at your peril .

Perhaps an inherent immunity already existed in the populace which masked the virulent nature of the threat hence the lassitude and complacency that has dropped the rest of the world right in the s ... t . The country from now on must be handled with the requisite suspicion , policing and controls otherwise it will be here we go again in just a matter of time . <p> And the biggest question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If it was ' just another virus ' then why cripple their economy for 2,500 deaths - even if that is 25,000 ; maybe even 250,000 ? There 's a billion plus lives affected by this in China alone . They did n't do it for our sake , but theirs , and the benefit of doing so must have been seen as outwigning the costs . Ergo , it 's worse than we think .... <p> China has had some pretty draconian restrictions in place for their lock down which has paid off with reducing their infection/death rates . It 's also allowed them to install some quite invasive tracking systems for their citizens which are rather scary . I know that their social credit system was scheduled to go in to full operation this year . <p> Lets hope that this new virus does n't mutate as much as the one in 1918 did ( Spanish flu ) , that wiped out a quarter of the world 's population . <p> The full figures are n't known for the 1918 Spanish Flu . Estimates on the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 million to 100 million deaths . If the upper end of that estimate is accurate , the 1918 pandemic killed more people than both World Wars put together . <p> The Spanish flu also had a far higher mortality rate then Covid 19 currently has , unless it mutates . <p> He is more than hopeless and the PM as usual when faced with a non-huggable decision shirks her responsibility to the People of this country . <p> Her excuse the " Disruption to our Health Sector " . By all accounts no one would even notice him missing , the only stuff he does appear to be actively contributing is different methods to break the rules . <p> Ai n't that the truth . Sub-par , is Mr Woodhouse . Mind you , I told Curran to her face that she was a wasted space . You have to go back to Hodgson to find an intellect capable of addressing the bigger issue(s) facing humankind - and he chose not to . Richard Walls probably had the cranial capability too , but ditto . <p> Covid is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise ) , rather it is the bright light shining into a lot of dark corporate recesses and finally exposing the truth of their operations . <p> It 's ironic is n't it ? Withholding information that is normally available to convince people that the bank is safe , when the publication of that information was for exactly that purpose . Enough to make you suspicious right off the bat ! I 'd pull my money ! <p> Not surprised . Wait till they ( Governments ) decide to filter or at worst turn of the internet to prevent widespread disinformation at times like these . Information control is commonly practised these days by Governments , agencies and even corporations . The easiest way to control a group of us humans . <p> One calculation I 've seen on the downstream cost of the lockdown and resultant unemployment . Unemployment increases the mortality rate of a working age person by 63%. 2017 mortality , presumably for a worker in the USA , is 348.2/100,000 . <p> Too right scarfie . The death rate from the lockdown and resultant unemployment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it up . Imperative people and supply chains that can work in isolation are allowed to continue working . " The economic crisis of 2008-10 , and the rise in unemployment that accompanied it , was associated with more than 260,000 excess cancer-related deaths -- including many considered treatable -- within the Organization for Economic Development ( OECD ) , according to a study from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health , Imperial College London , and Oxford University . " https : **27;295;TOOLONG ... I was reading about Archie Hunter he was a British General who spent most of his life in Africa , youngest son stuff uncle bought him a commision . He said that while in Africa %80 of young officers died from sickness and about %2 from fighting . He used modern machine guns effectively and warned the UK about the dangers of modern warfare pre WW1 . <p> Large carnivores roaming vast open spaces to keep humans under control ? Anything is possible I suppose ! Thankfully that bit comes after " the internet has been closed down " . So we wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ! <p> Yes , the number of annual flu deaths is quite sobering . But we 've lived with them for a century or so now . Cancer , heart disease , strokes are still the biggest killers . Cost/benefit decision are interesting - how many live would tobacco/alcohol bans and ultra low speed limits save ? What will be the true human cost of the Covid lockdown ? So many questions , so little time . <p> COVID will spread from a person to another . Tobacco and alcohol biological damage does not spread from the consumer to someone else . If COVID19 was something related to a life choice , then the comparison was rational . Otherwise it is baseless . Other diseases are also very personal , they are not infectious . <p> Also one has a vaccine and one does n't . Another obvious massive and critical difference . Given social distancing is in the model title it is stretching it to suggest I missed it ... But hey whatever floats your boat . The interesting point is the absolute numbers are very similar even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you saw it I 'd hope you factor it in to the comparison . Comparing one with massive effort to combat the spread of the virus with another with little effort to combat its spread ... then just saying , " but they both go to eleven " seems to be missing some pretty pertinent info . <p> You have a clear false comparison going on here profile , you are confusing a virus left to spread without control and one that is ( attempting ) being controlled with social distancing measures and lockdowns . The two are not equivalent . You need to put the 3% death rate in context as-if COVID-19 was left to spread uncontrollably - it would probably kill people in the millions at least . <p> Compare apples with apples and you may have more success in realising why they are locking down . <p> I 'm comparing 2018 absolute deaths with an up to date model - " Ultimately , these forecasts were developed to provide hospitals , health care workers , policymakers , and the public with crucial information about what demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could begin to plan . " <p> Neither seasons were left to spread without control . S Korea has not locked down and is in control of the situation . Yes I agree million would die if uncontrolled but that is rather redundant given it is being controlled - with varying rates of sophistication - depending on which country you live in . <p> If you post an opinion without a model people comment " but the models say ... " . Post a model from a respected source and people comment " that model is no good ... " without bothering to read the FAQs . <p> The model should be seen as a ' best possible case ' outcome . So yeah , comparing actual flu results against a ' best possible outcome ' and implying that the response to the current disease is overblown is disingenuous . <p> I 'm still dry , we only had 12 mls of rain . The hills are starting to lose some brown , we have no rain in forecast so could go back to brown soon . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen them . The coast from here and Sth got rain . 60 mls or more but some areas were very dry and will require follow up . We all have pasture damage , on the hills it 's crickets living in the cracks coming out and destroying anything close . However I think we are all happier after last weeks rain . Works have slowed right down to a crawl and I have heard of farmers desperate to get stock processed due to no feed , having to wait . Schedules falling lambs back .20c at weekend , talk of more to come . Talked to friend who killed some steers , got .60c a kg less than the lot he killed a few weeks ago . Without the saleyards operating it 's hard to know the value of stock . <p> I overseeded with a disk drill and Italian ryegrass mix also some oats and clover . I purchased a disk drill , friends with tine direct drills , with boots found the ground too hard and everything just slid along the surface . The good thing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured in , that has saved the grass seed and it 's all a inch high now . Neighbours are all feeding out , trying to take pressure of pasture and let the grass get ahead , farmers I talk to expect nothing but a massive recession , if not something even worse . <p> It 's all about locking up the food ; you 'd find it thought-provoking . I suspect the low , city-adjacent land will revert to local food production ( for local consumption ) and maybe within a season or two . <p> PDK , if you do n't mind eating Vegetables then you can grow a ton on a small area . personally I 'm a meat eater so need to hit out to some open country where the Buffalo roam . On the other hand if we fatten all the pets up ... <p> Sounds like common sense . I used to live in the North of Scotland - for 8 months a year food traveled by rail ( it was a long time ago ) north so we could eat something other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rail was diesel 60 years ago but today it could be solar or using sail powered boats . Just did n't feel like colonalism or empire although Scottish Nationalists may disagree . <p> My wife 's family is from Scotland , actually so is mine . I do love the place , nothing like those little scottish pubs . I can not believe the growth in Salmon farming , They send trucks down to Devon to pick up little fish they use to clean the nets . The whole industry is highly destructive dependent on antibiotics , dodgy food and cheap labor . <p> We stayed with my Wife 's distant cousins on Skye , nothing wrong with the black pudding and Haggis . My wife 's family had a farm in from Fort William but it 's now owned by some Saudis as a hunting lodge . We also have friends in Ned , which is an interesting place . <p> Depends on your perspective . Local to me is probably farther than you think is local . Most of New Zealand is local to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love my meat as well . Nothing beats a bit of veni fresh of the pan in the local hill country . So , there is ' local ' put simply . <p> Actually those compound bows are scary dangerous , no noise , then a 2 " hole x 3 though your middle , just sit down and contemplate life while you bleed out . When I was in California a guy missed his target , the arrow went through the hedge behind , through a window in the horse box , out the other side and into the heart of his wife 's horse grazing in the paddock . <p> Jacinda does n't want to sack David Clarke as there just is n't anyone in her or her cohorts parties , that have any ability . It is the weakest incompetent government that the country has ever had ! Jacinda and Grant Robertson are the only 2 that have shown their heads , where are the others ? Winston , Kelvin Davis , and the Greens , non existent like their ability . They have been abysmal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of this . The financial implications are going to be harsher than the medical ones without doubt ! <p> The government spin machine is downplaying it as a misjudged shortish 20KM drive when the reality is Clark consciously and in full knowledge of the rules his government was asking the rest of us to live by , brazenly made the decision to take the slow drive over steep hilly terrain on roads carrying little other traffic , thus exacerbating the risk . The good doctor of divinity 's moral compass conveniently switched off . Pharisaical hypocrite ! <p> Andrew - I was talking to bank manager , wanting to know if HO had formed any attitude to providing ongoing support . He said farming is the least of their worries . I looked at my increasing overdraft , because of the drought , and thought ' okay ' is a relative term . One positive is those one or two banks who bailed out of NZ farming in the last year or two may live to regret that decision . I know they caused hurt on the way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from Australia ? New World had mince as high as $18 a kg and looking at the lack of fat , I would say it was from a very old , very skinny dairy cow . I suspect dairy farmers are getting very low prices from meat works at present . <p> AJ that 's normal this time of year . You get all these " specials " on " prime " " low-fat mince " You 're right , it 's dairy farmers getting rid of old , empty or non-performing cows . And not just from Oz , I reckon they 're NZ animals . Do n't forget it 's still bloody dry in places and farmers need to sell stock . <p> We 've had enough rain to get things going but with little rain of late and little in the next ten days we are slipping fast . The fact that the advisor does n't want to dry off the cows is starting to grate . Actually been grating for ten days . <p> No , I 'll struggle to get them back to 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed to do it . Time wise I 've already dried off the first two weeks of Calvers ( last 2 weeks July ) and all culls are gone . Might scrape a just below 4 average . <p> I got an email from one of the meat processors . Ovine ( sheep ) kill reduced by 50% , beef 30% due to COVID . Dairy grazing is part of the collateral damage of the reduced ovine kill . The value of written grazing contracts will be shown to be either valuable , or not , in the current climate . 1 . Dairy farmer was told by his grazier that the grazier is n't able to take his stock this winter as grazier ca n't his sheep away to works , so will need the feed for his own stock . Dairy farmer reply was -'so why are you telling me this , we have a contract and it 's your problem not mine , according to that ' . 2 . In another situation the grazier has informed his dairy clients that he is upping the price to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dairy farmer has spread his winter grazing out over several graziers - no written contracts . All except one grazier has recently told him - no winter grazing available now due to not being able to get graziers own stock away and which has compounded the effects of floods reducing winter crop and baleage sailing away down river . 4 . Some graziers have decided that they can make more money buying beef at the now low prices and 2mths out from winter grazing commitments have cancelled their grazing ( verbal ) contracts . - They will be remembered . Though this is not the first time that some farmers in Southland have reneged on grazing contracts late in the season . Some Southern farmers are having to spend substantial ( six figure ) sums on buying in feed to get their stock through this winter because of late notice cancelled winter grazing contracts . 2019/20 is/has been an ' annus horribilis ' for many Southern farmers . <p> Well if it helps , they are not the only ones suffering . I would have thought farmers could use Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotten autumn last year , hard winter , cold dry spring , worst drought , high temps in the 40 's , summer just rolled into Autumn . I have hardly any stock on and I could still chase a mouse across the place . I managed to find some hay for a guy yesterday , 100 big squares , I did have to ask what he 's going to do end of May when the hay has all gone , he just shrugged . Perhaps dairy farmers may have to cut back on the winter grazing , i find it hard on my soils , an expensive high cost option , would rather do something else almost anything else . Having said that $42 a week would be tempting me . <p> Thanks for the real farmers ' sitreps on this thread . Reports from the front , rather than from the theoreticians , zealots and idealists who are safe , way behind the pointy end , are always welcome . Keep ' em coming , chaps and chapesses . <p> Yep definitely not the only ones - in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of industries , of just how challenging the ag sector has had it this season - regardless of where you farm . It 's not a one size fits all , as different regions have different issues - for some it is drought but for others its floods etc . Yes , not everyone likes shifting fences and portable water troughs in winter . ; - ) If we did n't have COVID and therefore a works backlog , we would n't have had the very short notice grazing cancellations to the degree we are seeing . Many graziers and dairy clients had kept in touch re the flood impacts . On the bright side , feed has been available to buy , and is only now getting harder to find , though most will have purchased what they need to get through the winter . It wo n't just be rural NZ potentially living a ' winter of discontent ' this year . This year all NZ will be in it together , one way or another , so we will require very good leadership . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing has become a casino and the gamblers have a serious gambling addiction <p> The economic fundamentals are in tatters , and there is absolutely no logical reason to invest in anything or any business other than maybe one or two sectors such as health services , pharma , and food processing , but these shares had not dropped as much as the other sectors , so they are probably still over fair value . <p> The whole thing defies logic and seems too good to be true , so it probably is <p> The financial markets have been no different . Although many in the US just clip the ticket with their commissions while loading up their clients with leveraged ETFs which are likely to blow up if they have n't already . <p> Whether it 's financial instruments or rental houses I 've been telling people to reduce leverage for a couple of years now .

Talking of ASX vs NZX , there are some interesting possibilities in heavily sold down Aussie tracker funds , given the NZD/AUD cross rate is strong . <p> Yvil , the above figures are not informative . Itally has had 16K death a month from COVID 19 ( that is despite all the strict measures they have taken ) , so if no measure was taken , lets assume that this monthly death number would have been for the next 12 month ( or until the majority of the population would have got it , which is a sound assumption as the disease is very infectious ) . That would have killed 160k in a year in Italy . Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people who died from COVID might have died anyway during the year . but even at 100k COVD 19 death , the difference is massive . <p> Equity markets surge !

So how come the NZX50 ( up 300% from the GFC ) is still trading higher today ? Logic please anyone ? <p> No logic . Have been wondering the same for the last couple of weeks . The first NZX 25% drop I thought just brought the markets down to where they should have self-corrected before Covid . I was , and am , waiting for another 20%+ drop before jumping back in ( actually a lot more after last weeks run up ) .

Photo : Supplied <p> When you 're leading the team that 's modelling the worst-case scenarios for how Covid-19 might spread in New Zealand , you do n't wait for a government directive to stay home : you follow your own advice . <p> " Once we realised that this work was probably going to be really critical , and having a little bit of an insight into what was coming , we moved people home last week . " <p> The study was already occupied by Hendy 's wife , a lawyer , who needed somewhere to keep confidential client files .

Mostly though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : desktop , laptop , iPad . <p> Te Punaha Matatini , the centre for research excellence that Hendy leads , studies complex systems and networks . Right now , he and the centre 's other researchers are working to predict how Covid-19 's web of infection might spread - and if it 's possible to slow it down or even stop it . <p> His colleague , microbiologist Siouxsie Wiles ( who has now become one of the foremost science communicators during the outbreak ) , was first to take notice of the virus when it began to run rampant in parts of China . " She was watching it nervously back in January , so we were kind of aware of it . " <p> About a month ago , Hendy himself decided to do a little bit of preliminary modelling . " That told me it was gon na be bad ... And so at that point we decided we should really start building a project team to refine the type of modelling I was doing . " <p> A pair of Christchurch colleagues who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the team has expanded since then to about 20 people , mostly in Auckland and Christchurch . <p> Left unchecked , the virus would eventually infect 89 percent of New Zealand 's population and kill up to 80,000 people in a worst-case scenario . <p> ICU beds would reach capacity within two months and the number of patients needing intensive care would exceed 10 times that capacity by the time the virus peaked . <p> " Tens of thousands of people would die , our health system would collapse and people would n't be able to get proper treatment . That explains why the government 's been prepared to take such drastic steps , " Hendy says . " The worst-case scenario is a really unpalatable one . " <p> Even the best-case scenario is hard to swallow . It assumes restrictions similar to the lockdown now in place - but suggests that unless testing , contact tracing , and isolation cut the number of cases to just a handful , the restrictions might need to remain in place for over a year . <p> And if the cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventual peak will swell well beyond hospital capacity as soon as any lockdown ends , unless a vaccine or treatment is found in the interim . <p> " When controls are lifted after 400 days , an outbreak occurs with a similar peak size as for an uncontrolled epidemic , " Hendy and his colleagues wrote in a paper rushed out yesterday . " In other words , these strategies can delay but not prevent the epidemic . " <p> The good news - if there is any - is that while strict suppression measures remain in place , fatalities should remain in the low dozens and hospital capacity would n't be exceeded . That would buy New Zealand time to wait for a vaccine or a successful treatment . <p> That research was given to the government last week as it grappled with how to respond to the pandemic . The team 's best-case scenario - strong suppression - is essentially what the government has gone with , Hendy says . " One of the great things about going into lockdown now is it really does make the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that works and we can stamp out the disease , then we really might only see a handful of deaths and be able to keep this thing out .

" <p> After three weeks of working autonomously , the team 's interaction with government officials is about to ramp up . " We 've now got a connection with the national crisis management centre , who are acting as a clearing-house - so ... we 'll actually be sending them daily modelling reports .

" We look at what happens if you take controls on and off , " Hendy says . " Can you put your foot on the brake for a while and then take it off and let everybody have a breather ? " <p> In unprecedented conditions , the team is drawing on whatever past experience it can . Among Hendy 's colleagues are researchers who worked on modelling and controlling the Mycoplasma bovis outbreak in cattle , and the 2015 Queensland fruit fly scare in Grey Lynn , Auckland - coincidentally , the suburb Hendy lives in - where restrictions on the movement of fruit and vegetables were put in place . <p> Three years ago , Hendy and others carried out a study to see if they could predict the spread of seasonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to track the movement of people from one DHB area to another . " On a given day , how many people went from MidCentral to Capital &amp; Coast , for example ? And that was enough for us to say something useful about how the flu moved around the country . " Now , they 're hoping to do the same for Covid-19 , but at a suburb-to-suburb level . " We ought to see a big reduction in people moving round ... and that 'll start to give us a good handle on how well we 're combating the disease . " <p> The kitchen table Ground Zero for New Zealand 's Covid-19 modelling is n't foolproof . " I had my first big hiccup this morning when someone from central government emailed me a whole bunch of Excel spreadsheets .

" <p> Amaral said the addresses of people with positive tests is shared with local public safety officials " on a regular basis " in New Hampshire and Massachusetts . <p> The Massachusetts commissioner of public health issued an order March 18 that allows the addresses of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to be given to local board of health and emergency response services .

South Carolina provides the information through a secure statewide database made available to first responders only . <p> Robert Long , spokesman for the Maine CDC , said the practice of listing confirmed cases only by gender , age range and county of residence is consistent with the practice in most states . <p> " This system protects patient privacy as we continue with the Department of Public Safety to ensure that first responders have the equipment and guidance they need to do their jobs safely , " Long said . <p> Long said he is not aware of requests similar to Kittery 's coming from other Maine municipalities or agencies . <p> Dispatchers from the Maine Department of Public Safety and other dispatch centers are asking virus-related questions from callers who are requesting a response to a home , whether it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCausland , spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety . <p> " Those answers help first responders know the potential of what they are dealing with , prior to arrival , " McCausland said . <h> Related <p> State health officials have repeatedly advised people to assume everyone they come into contact with could have COVID-19 and to take precautions as if they themselves have it . <p> " One of the things we know about this coronavirus is it spreads very quickly across any geography , " Shah said when asked Tuesday at a daily media briefing about why the number of positive cases is not available by town . " What we want to do is provide numbers at an aggregate enough number that gives view of what 's going on in any area , but also maintains privacy , " Shah said . <p> Sharing the information about COVID-19 patients with emergency medical responders would not mean the addresses will get shared with residents and neighbors , Amaral said .

They see it tarnishing their prior workplace achievements and reducing their confidence and self-respect . <p> Up here in Vermont , many are hurting financially . Yet , some are reluctant and embarrassed to take advantage of the help provided to them by the CARES Act , and other available assistance . <p> We must convince our neighbors that they have nothing to be ashamed of , and help them understand the financial assistance options available . We need to easily and clearly provide them with information and resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal help they desperately need . <p> Many people who find themselves in financial crisis have NEVER filed for unemployment , received food stamps , gone to a food bank or ever needed community aid of any sort . They believed that this is for other folks who do n't have the same work ethic they have . Many made it -- barely -- through the Great Recession , and just when times were good again -- the pandemic happened . <p> The lifelines being extended as a result of the pandemic are no different than the disaster relief provide after an earthquake or tornado . The relief being offered ensures that our citizens will survive financially , which in turn will help quickly restart our economy when this crisis if over . If you are struggling as a result of the pandemic , remember that you did nothing wrong . You have been struck by an economic hurricane . <p> Without guilt or shame , be grateful and take advantage of the following options that may help you survive financially through the pandemic : <p> * IRS Payment : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many taxpayers and social security recipients by mid-April ( $1,200 per adult , $500 child/dependent ) if the IRS has your direct deposit information on file . Paper checks via the mail will take much longer to reach you , perhaps several months . <p> * Unemployment Insurance : If you are among the millions who have lost your job , been furloughed , or had your hours reduced , you should apply for your state 's unemployment benefits . Unemployment benefits have been extended to a maximum of 39 weeks and includes a federal payment of $600 a week in addition to your state 's benefit . The CARES Act extends unemployment benefits to the self-employed for the first time and this includes contractors and gig economy workers like Uber drivers . <p> * Retirement Savings Loan or Early Withdrawal : Those diagnosed with COVID-19 ( or their immediate family members ) or suffering financially due to the pandemic are eligible for loans of up to $100,000 from their 401(k) or 403(b) plans , if their plans offer loans . The CARES Act also allows early withdrawals ( before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of up to an aggregate of $100,000 without paying the penalty tax . All withdrawals will be subject to income tax payable over three years . <p> * Small Business Assistance : If you own a small business ( less than 500 employees ) , you can receive loans from the government that include tax-free loan forgiveness for 12 weeks of employee payroll , health care and other business expenses . <p> * Mortgage and Rent Forbearance : The CARES Act calls for suspension of foreclosures for 60 days on mortgages backed by the government , and individuals have the right to request forbearance on loans for up to 180 days and to request an extension for up to an additional 180 days . To get this relief you MUST contact you loan servicer . Regulators have asked lenders and mortgage servicers on loans not backed by the government to consider loan modifications and similar forms of forbearance . <p> * Utility Bills Relief : Many utility companies ( heat , electricity , phones and cable/internet ) are offering relief to their customers on bill payments .

@@31767441 <p> And just like that , we were all out of flour . It could n't have happened at a worse time . It was 9:00pm in our suburban neighborhood in West Bengal , and India 's federal government had just announced a statewide lockdown an hour ago . The lockdown went into effect at midnight , and would enforce a halt to pretty much everything in the country save emergency services , with a mere four hours ' notice . <p> People surged into the streets on motorbikes , in cars , and on foot . Everyone scrambled to buy groceries and essential items like soap and toiletries . And when I say buy , I actually mean hoard . <p> Our house is on the main street , and we could hear a police car pass by with its loudspeaker blaring that essential goods would be available throughout the lockdown , and there was no need to panic-buy . Nevertheless , people kept pouring outside , most wearing little more than a handkerchief turned into a makeshift mask for flimsy protection . <p> But we needed flour . I tried to carefully avoid every shop where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores were packed . I went to at least five different shops in our small area of town before I found one that was comparatively empty . Thankfully , it still had flour . <p> The three-week lockdown was announced on Tuesday , March 24 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic that , at the time of publishing this article , has caused a reported 13,000 deaths and counting in the US , and more than 86,000 deaths worldwide . In India , reported deaths are comparatively lower at fewer than 200 , but many fear for what 's to come , especially when people have refused to practice social distancing or stay at home despite repeated warnings from researchers , doctors , and government officials , leaving the administration with no choice but to enforce a full-blown lockdown . <p> Even before the announcement was made by prime minister Narendra Modi , several individual states had been instituting partial lockdowns of their own . West Bengal , the state that we live in , had already been on lockdown since that Monday . But even now , despite constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishments , people are out in the streets , most shopping in fear of not having enough supplies to last through the crisis . <h> What a pandemic does to our mental health <p> I realize that the issue is a lot bigger than myself or my family . In fact , this is the first time when people from around the world have shared in an experience to this degree . In a lot of ways , it 's presented an opportunity to come together -- because , if not now , then when ? Still , I 'd be lying if I told you that this chaos has had no effect on my personal psyche . <p> I am 21 years old , and I 'm diagnosed with obsessive compulsion disorder . Right now , I live in an erstwhile industrial town called Durgapur , about two hours by car from Kolkata , with my mother , an elementary school teacher , and my maternal grandmother , who 's a homemaker . <p> I developed OCD when I was around 5 . My father was a pediatrician in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to a massive heart attack when I was in the first grade . My psychiatrist will tell you that it was the trigger event for my OCD . My symptoms have changed with time , but generally speaking , manic depression , anxiety , and obsessive thinking are things I have had to deal with since I was a child . <p> It 's gone on for so long that I 've quite forgotten what it 's like to be what you might call " neurotypical . " I have to maintain an elaborate drug regimen just to help me get through the day . Therapy helped for a while , but ultimately , it did n't have much effect . <p> When I first found out about the novel coronavirus , I actually handled it pretty well , all things considered . Then someone told me that one of the symptoms of Covid-19 is a rash . The funny thing is , I knew they were wrong . Covid-19 does not cause a rash . Still , I started experiencing a constant tingling sensation all over my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write this , I can still feel inklings of it . <p> Then came the crushing anxiety -- although it 'd be wrong to say that all of it was the sole result of my mental health . I have three older adults in my extended family who are patients of chronic respiratory problems , one of whom is a smoker . My first thought was that if anyone in my circle were to contract it and it spread , they would n't make it past this summer . I had already lost my grandfather just last year , and now I stood to lose more family . <p> The dread I 'm experiencing often feels unspeakable . I know many people are feeling it , too . A few days ago , I felt that way almost all the time . I could n't eat , could n't work , could n't even sleep without having nightmares . I ca n't confidently say it 's all better right now . But I have discovered one thing that 's offered some consolation . <h> Comfort in the form of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , in the form of a book . <p> Specifically , Life As We Knew It by Susan Beth Pfeffer , the award-winning novelist who writes young-adult science fiction . Her best stories , in my opinion , are tales about the end of the world . <p> In this book , the apocalypse is n't caused by a viral outbreak that turns everyone into zombies , nor by aliens arriving to invade and enslave the human race . It 's caused by a meteor crash that collides into our moon , causing it to be thrown off its usual orbit and bringing it closer to earth . <p> Since the moon influences the tides , the anomaly causes a dramatic change in the geology of planet Earth , leading to tsunamis all across the globe . New storm clouds cause an immense change in weather patterns . <p> When the resulting change causes most of the world 's systems to falter -- markets close , governments fail , the grid shuts down -- our protagonist , a teenage girl named Miranda , is forced to confront a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . The book is not just about surviving the apocalypse ; it 's about what comes after . <p> Finding solace in a story about the end of the world might sound counterintuitive , especially in the midst of a global pandemic . And while we ca n't seem to quite put our finger on why it provides a balm for our anxieties -- not scientifically , at least -- there is something therapeutic about reading someone else 's imaginings of the worst . Some say it mirrors back our own anxieties , presumably helping us feel less alone . Others say it allows us to identify what we are hopeful about and thankful for , even in the midst of gloom and catastrophe . <p> For a book that deals with the harsh realities of a world suddenly upended , Life As We Knew It does not sacrifice hope for cynicism . In fact , hope is the deciding factor in this novel , the one thing that keeps the protagonist and her family going despite impossible odds . In the end , that was the thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape from reality , sci-fi provides us with a window through which to confront our darkest fears . The best stories about the end of the world are not meant to elicit terror ; they 're there to show us a way forward even when every door around us seems to slam shut . Not only does it force us to face the idea of a world changed , but it also shows us how to live through it , despite the uncertainty and the dread . It shows us how to deal with our anxiety instead of suppressing it . <p> Pfeffer is n't the only author I 've been reading during my time in lockdown . The Book Of M by Peng Shepherd deals with love and dementia as the world is literally ending due to a strange phenomenon that causes people 's shadows to disappear . People who lose their shadows gain extraordinary power but can no longer retain any memories . Some of them forget even the most basic things , like how to unlock a door , or how to chew . Others set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts of the old one . The book is both abstract and profound , and as someone who recently lost their grandfather to dementia , I could n't help but relate to it on a deep level . And in the middle of it all are our protagonists , a couple who tries to hold on to what little they have left of each other . <p> In all the science fiction that I 've managed to read during the past weeks , the themes of hope and desolation have regularly entwined , as though one could n't possibly exist without the other . It 's kind of true , I suppose . Humans have the capacity to find hope in the most desperate of situations . I 've been reminded of this in another book , called They Both Die At The End , which is set in a near-future world where there 's an app for everything . As one app notifies our two protagonists that they are living the last day of their lives , another pairs them together for one last epic adventure before they die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown the value of experiencing love and hope , even when we know we 're hurtling toward certain death . <p> Through each book that I read , I realize more and more that the emotions we 're dealing with right now -- uncertainty , dread , a fear of losing the ones we love -- are all things that human beings have dealt with throughout our time on earth . It is how we respond to these threats and the choices we make in spite of them that makes us who we are . <p> Covid-19 will not be the thing that ends the human race . It will not kill everyone . But it will continue to chip away at our most vulnerable -- the old , the sick , and the far too young . The world we are left with when this catastrophe is finally over will be different for it . <p> With economies upended , healthcare systems failing , and stores running out of resources from a constant cycle of hoarding and panic-buying , we will be forced to confront who we really are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our selfishness get the better of us and save ourselves , or do we face the coming odds with unity and solidarity ? Chances are the answer will be a bit of both . <p> The point here is not that we should panic ; quite the opposite . If there was ever a time to cultivate calm and take care of ourselves , even in small moments , it is now . <p> Three things have helped me manage my anxiety and get through this unreal world we now live in , which I hope will help you , as well . <p> First , fact-check your news -- there is a lot of fake news and rumors floating around , so make sure that you check your sources , and the science , before you jump into believing something that otherwise seems suspicious . <p> Second , offer help when you can , and ask for it if you need it . There are plenty of solid organizations working to help communities in need that are accepting donations right now . There are also dedicated support groups that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe difficulties at this time of crisis . <p> My third piece of advice ? Read a lot of books ! When reality seems like it 's closing in on all sides , immersing yourself in the tale of another person from another world can help bring some much-needed perspective to the one we 're navigating now .

" <p> Realm of Caring , an organization that Figi co-founded , also shared a statement on Facebook , saying : " Some journeys are long and bland and others are short and poignant and meant to revolutionize the world .

A life that created a revolutionary movement in legitimizing cannabis as a therapeutic option . " <p> A cause of death has not yet been confirmed , although there have been reports that Charlotte died of complications related to COVID-19 . Per The Colorado Sun , Paige Figi had been saying on Facebook recently that her family had been hit by a serious illness , although she did not specify that it was the coronavirus . Multiple news outlets also sourced the COVID-19 information to the aforementioned Realm of Caring Facebook post , although that wording has since been removed from the post . Realm of Caring did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone 's request for comment . <p> Charlotte Figi had her first seizure when she was three months old and at 2-and-a-half years she was diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome , a rare form of epilepsy . Over the next several years , her parents tried an array of different treatments , but Charlotte 's condition worsened and her seizures grew more frequent .

It was , unsurprisingly , no easy feat , but they eventually found two that were willing to sign off on the idea , in part because the potential dangers of even low-THC marijuana on a child 's brain seemed to pale in comparison to the damage already wrought by Charlotte 's seizures and previous regimens of medication . This being the early 2010s , well before the CBD and marijuana concentrate boom , Charlotte 's parents had to buy two ounces of high CBD weed and have a friend extract the oil . <p> " We were pioneering the whole thing ; we were guinea-pigging Charlotte , " Paige told CNN in 2013 . " This is a federally illegal substance . I was terrified to be honest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost immediately : " When she did n't have those three , four seizures that first hour , that was the first sign , " Paige added . <p> Charlotte 's story quickly garnered plenty of media attention and , in the coming years , families with kids in similar situations began moving to Colorado to legally treat their children 's seizure disorders with CBD . Soon , more states began to pass laws that made CBD more readily available , while at the federal level , hemp -- which can be used to produce CBD along with marijuana -- was removed from the Controlled Substances Act in 2014 , and in 2018 Congress approved a farm bill that legalized industrial hemp . <p> The Figi family played a major role during this sea change , specifically through their work with the Realm of Caring Foundation , which helps those who ca n't afford medical marijuana gain access to potential treatments .

He was 73 . <p> Prine had been hospitalized since late March after developing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 . His wife , Fiona , had tested positive for the coronavirus earlier in March and was staying in quarantine , isolated from Prine , whose history of health problems included twice beating cancer and canceling tour dates last year when doctors said he was at an elevated risk of a stroke . <p> When news of his hospitalization broke , two words ricocheted across Twitter : American and treasure . <p> " From the first time I heard Prine , he was saying things I wish I could say , I wish I 'd thought of , " said singer-songwriter John McEuen , who worked with Prine through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind .

Prine 's self-titled first album included evocative epics Sam Stone , about a disillusioned soldier addicted to heroin ; and Angel From Montgomery , told from the perspective of an overworked housewife who declares , " To believe in this living is just a hard way to go .

" <p> Last year , he hosted his first All the Best Fest , a flyaway festival in the Dominican Republic , featuring artists like Steve Earle , Brandi Carlisle and Lucinda Williams , who had looked up to Prine for years before becoming friendly with him in Nashville . <p> " Everybody wanted me to write with them , " Williams said in an interview last year .

" <p> Prine had spent the last couple of years on a career-capping victory lap , touring behind his album The Tree of Forgiveness and racking up a series of honorifics and recognitions , including the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Grammys ' Lifetime Achievement Award . <p> It all kept him busier than he had been in years . Which meant he spent more time than ever away from his second home in Pinellas County . <p> For years , Prine kept close friends in Pinellas , including the late promoter Johnny Green , and came often to visit , fishing and barbecuing and catching R&amp;R .

@@31770141 <p> Slate is making its coronavirus coverage free for all readers . Subscribe to support our journalism . Start your free trial . <p> On Monday evening , two different courts issued two disastrous decisions , a one-two punch that has forced countless Wisconsin voters to choose between their health and their voting rights in Tuesday 's election . First , the Wisconsin Supreme Court overruled Gov . Tony Evers ' order postponing the election , restoring in-person voting on Tuesday in the midst of a pandemic . Hours later , the U.S. Supreme Court effectively nullified tens of thousands of absentee ballots that wo n't be returned until after the election -- not because voters forgot , but because election officials did not mail them out in time . Both decisions were issued by conservative judges ; both will help Republicans suppress legitimate votes . Taken together , they are the Bush v. Gore of 2020 , a flagrant judicial heist that renders Tuesday 's election a sham . <p> These two rulings spurred strong dissents condemning this mass disenfranchisement -- but only one of them lays bare the overt partisanship motivating the judiciary 's conduct . Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took pains to say she did " not doubt the good faith of my colleagues , " suggesting the conservative majority had made a mistake , or simply disagreed over a legal principle . By contrast , Justice Ann Walsh Bradley , dissenting from the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision , castigated her court for a pattern of lending " unmitigated support of efforts to disenfranchise voters . " Ginsburg 's conciliatory tack is understandable ; she has a lifetime appointment that gives her an incentive to play nice with her colleagues and preserve the institutional prestige of the Supreme Court . Bradley , who is elected to fixed terms , has more leeway to publicly shame others on the bench . In her scorched-earth assault on her colleagues ' integrity , Bradley is leveling with the public , raising the alarm over the judiciary 's threat to democracy . It is long past time for impartial judges to take off the kid gloves and call out their colleagues ' cynical , bad-faith crusade against voting rights . <p> It 's easy to see why Bradley took direct aim at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak . The most important race on the ballot is for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court : Justice Daniel Kelly -- an archconservative who once said slavery and affirmative action " are the same " -- is defending his seat against challenger Jill Karofsky , a liberal circuit judge . Currently , the court is divided 5 -- 2 between conservatives and progressives . If Karofsky ousts Kelly , liberals will have a chance to flip the court in 2023 . The new progressive majority could then strike down Republicans ' worst voter suppression measures , including their impenetrable partisan gerrymander . <p> Recognizing the stakes of the election , Kelly 's conservative colleagues have lined up to support him -- and condemn Karofsky . After Karofsky criticized Kelly for repeatedly siding with Republican interests , Chief Justice Patience Roggensack and Justice Annette Ziegler issued a statement condemning her for " undermining the court 's legitimacy " and failing to " act with the decorum appropriate to the office . " Justices Brian Hagedorn and Rebecca Bradley went even further , denouncing Karofsky 's criticisms as " slanderous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They accused her of using an " outcome-driven judicial approach " while commending Kelly for " the quality of his reasoning and the depth of his commitment to the judicial craft . " Hagedorn and Bradley then effectively endorsed Kelly over Karofsky , declaring : " We are absolutely confident that we need his integrity and intellect to continue on the Court . " <p> Notably , while all four justices defended Kellyagainst Karofsky 's putatively unfair attacks , they said nothing about the justice 's own false accusations against his opponents . For instance , Kelly ran an ad alleging that Karofsky is " dangerously soft on crime " because she " went easy " on a sexual predator -- an objectively false statement . Kelly ran a different ad announcing that Karofsky allowed a plea deal that put a sex offender " back on the street , " yet another lie . He also said Karofsky sought " to disarm law abiding citizens " because she tweeted in support of gun safety laws that " respect constitutional rights " while making " every family safer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out statements rebuking Kelly for slandering his opponent . <p> There is no real doubt that holding the election during a pandemic will decrease Democratic turnout . In disproportionately Democratic urban centers such as Milwaukee , election officials have been forced to shutter the vast majority of polling places because poll workers refused to show up for fear of infection . That 's why the GOP-dominated Legislature denied the governor 's request to delay the election . After the Legislature sued to block Evers ' order , Kelly recused himself from the case . But his four conservative colleagues did not -- even though they have a vested interest in the outcome . And sure enough , the court voted 4 -- 2 to resume the coronavirus election . <p> The majority 's unsigned opinion provided " scant rationale , " as Bradley put it , for its actions . Evers relied on a Wisconsin law that allows him to " issue such orders as he or she deems necessary for the security of persons and property . " Despite the sweeping nature of this power , the majority interpreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect Wisconsinites from lethal threats . As Bradley wrote in dissent : <p> With the decision of the majority , democracy takes a step backwards . Paying no heed to the warnings or the science , the majority circumvents the law , while disenfranchising voters and putting at risk the health and safety of our fellow Wisconsinites . ... Neither the law nor common sense support the majority 's tenuous and callous order . <p> Bradley also chastised the majority for its rank hypocrisy . She pointed out that the court previously suspended civil trials due to the pandemic , recognizing " the unacceptable risk of forcing Wisconsinites to congregate during this pandemic . " In doing so , Roggensack explained that this step was necessary to protect " the people of Wisconsin " and " the families of jurors who would be at increased risk of COVID-19 infections carried home by family members who performed jury service . " Yet , Bradley wrote , Roggensack displayed no similar concern for " the health of our families , neighbors and friends " when forcing citizens to choose between " needless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to vote . <p> Ginsburg 's dissent , while sharp , slings no such barbs at the majority . Without calling into question " the good faith of my colleagues , " Ginsburg wrote that the majority 's decision " will result in massive disenfranchisement . " But when five Republican-appointed justices nullify " tens of thousands " of votes in an unsigned eleventh-hour order , is there really noreason to doubt their good faith ? Even when their act is likely to favor Republicans ? <p> Perhaps , taken in isolation , the majority 's decision can be defended as a grievous mistake motivated not by partisanship but a misunderstanding of the facts . After all , it includes at least one error -- an assertion that the plaintiffs never asked for the ability to return ballots after April 7 , a claim that Ginsburg debunked . But Monday 's decision can not be taken in isolation . It is the latest in a long line of rulings by the Roberts court that blatantly favor Republican interests by allowing the GOP to suppress Democratic votes . In recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act , allowing mass poll closures , racial gerrymandering , and draconian voter ID laws . It has greenlighted voter purges and closed the federal courthouse door to partisan gerrymandering cases . Its redistricting decisions permitted Wisconsin 's Republicans to maintain their legislative majority even when they receive fewer votes , a majority they used to preserve Tuesday 's election . <p> Put simply , the U.S. Supreme Court has also lent its " unmitigated support of efforts to disenfranchise voters , " in Bradley 's words . Federal judges have a duty to say so . Ginsburg wrote that her colleagues ' order " will result in massive disenfranchisement , " but that phrasing seems too roundabout . The Supreme Court itself inflicted " massive disenfranchisement , " reversing a decision that protected voters disenfranchised through no fault of their own . These justices took it upon themselves to intervene on behalf of Wisconsin Republicans and void these voters ' ballots . They made a bad situation exponentially worse , favoring partisan demands over constitutional rights . <p> Chief Justice John Roberts cares enough about his court 's legitimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassments . His occasional moderation seems to persuade the liberals to pull punches for fear that he will permanently join the reactionary wing of the court . They clearly believe they have a responsibility to treat the court as a neutral arbiter , not an organ of the GOP . So far , this approach has worked for Roberts : Most Americans approve of the way the Supreme Court is operating and do not believe it shows too much ideological bias . <p> In March , U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman wrote a law review article titled " The Roberts Court 's Assault on Democracy . " In it , he wrote that " the Roberts Court has been anything but passive . Rather , the Court 's hard right majority is actively participating in undermining American democracy , " engaging in " a direct assault on the right of poor people and minorities to vote . " Monday night 's order neatly illustrated this phenomenon . The five Republican-appointed justices may have near-unlimited power to swing elections .

In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Michael Pakko , chief economist at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock 's Arkansas Economic Development Institute , said the jobless claims announced by Hutchinson are " pretty big numbers for sure , " and higher than he would have predicted a couple of weeks ago . <p> But he said the numbers are in line with his most recent forecast , issued Wednesday , which predicts that the state 's unemployment rate will rise to 9.2% by the end of the year . That 's a revision of his forecast last month that showed it reaching 8.7% . <p> " I think these job loss figures are supporting the kind of real recessionary outlook that 's in the forecast right now , " Pakko said . <p> BENEFIT NOT READY <p> Under the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security Act passed by Congress last month , unemployment checks include an extra $600 a week from the federal government . <p> Arkansas Commerce Secretary Mike Preston said the state must create a new system to process claims by self-employed people and independent contractors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the year . <p> The system should be ready in about three weeks .

" I know it 's going to be a challenging couple of weeks . " <p> BUSINESS LOANS <p> Preston said 138 no-interest loans have been issued to small businesses using money from Hutchinson 's quick action closing fund and lawsuit proceeds contributed by Attorney General Leslie Rutledge . <p> Hutchinson used $4 million from his fund to start the program , which also guarantees 80% of loans made by banks , and Rutledge contributed $3 million . <p> The governor said Wednesday that he would add another $1 million from the quick-action closing fund toward the effort . <p> The loans are meant to allow businesses to continue to pay their employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the federal relief measure . <p> " Our hope and goal on this is to make sure that we do n't send more people to have to go to unemployment , " Preston said . <h> Arkansas ' covid-19 cases by county <p> The Medicaid waiver program is designed to complement the relief that health care providers will receive under the federal measure , said Dennis Smith , the state Department of Human Services ' senior adviser for Medicaid and health care reform . <p> Among other things , it would provide $55 million in federal funds that would be used to supplement the salaries of workers who care for the elderly and disabled in long-term-care facilities or provide home-based care . <p> An additional $31 million in federal funds would go to small hospitals and clinics to be used for capital improvements , such as establishing drive-thru testing sites . <p> The state 's match , $25 million , would come from state funds freed up when the federal matching rate for the Medicaid and Children 's Health Insurance Program was increased by 6.2% under the Families First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that was targeted , and wanted to help jump-start things to where providers could keep their doors open and keep serving clients , " Smith said in an interview last month . <p> The state submitted its application March 26 .

( AP Photo/Elaine Thompson , File ) <p> SEATTLE -- Experts and health officials who are trying to plan a response to the coronavirus outbreak are missing a critical piece of information -- the number of health care workers who have tested positive for the disease . <p> Washington state faced the first major outbreak of covid-19 in the nation , but health officials have not kept track of how many doctors and nurses have the disease .

" Porteous said . " Without regional and national public health data on covid-19 infections in health care personnel , it is difficult to envision how to start answering this question . " <p> During the SARS outbreak , Porteous said , data about " an alarmingly high rate of infection and death " in medical staff led to improved rules around infection protocol and use of personal protective equipment . <p> Ruth Schubert , spokeswoman for the Washington Nurses Association , said that same data is needed for covid-19 . <p> " We are urging the Department of Health and the emergency operations team at the state level to begin collecting and reporting this information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the coronavirus will impact the country 's health care system say they also want the data to better determine how severely hospitals will be affected . <p> While health officials count ICU beds and calculate hospital capacity to plan for a surge in cases , Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington , has created a model for predicting covid-19 deaths .

Now we hear with the spread of novel coronavirus that prevention steps include stopping that finger 's swipe across an eye , nose , mouth . <p> And how easy is that ? Does n't reading a story about how not to touch your face give you an uncontrollable urge to touch your face ? <p> Spokane health professionals offer strategies they use and share with their patients . The tips might help slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their ideas go in tandem with regular handwashing . <p> " It can be totally natural to want to touch your face , so I tell patients it 's OK to touch your face , just wash your hands first with soap and water for 20 seconds , " said family physician Dr. David Ward , who is based at Kaiser Permanente 's Lincoln Heights Medical Office . <p> Consider the reasons , too , added Dr. John McCarthy , a family medicine doctor at the Native Project clinic . We 're trying to prevent the transfer of pathogens picked up by our hands that get into the body through mucous membranes -- via eyes , nose and mouth . <p> " Our hands will pick up bacteria and viral particles from anything we touch , " said McCarthy , also Okanogan County 's public health officer and an assistant dean for University of Washington School of Medicine . He encourages people to be more aware of face-touching . <p> " It 's totally unconscious , and I catch myself doing it , " he said . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , ' OK , I touched a doorknob . If my nose itches , I 'll use the back of my hand . ' <p> " I challenge everybody to pay attention to how often we touch our eyes or have a tickle on the nose . It 's the mucous membranes we want to stay away from . " <p> Dr. Dan Getz has daily reasons to avoid touching his face . He works as chief medical officer of acute care with Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and Children 's Hospital . <p> " The mantra is handwash , handwash , handwash , " Getz said . " Beyond that , I am using my nondominate left hand to open all doors or reach for things on my desk , which may give me a little protection if I inadvertently reach to my face with my right hand . <p> " I have been trying to interlock the fingers of both hands prior to addressing the urge to touch my face , " he said . " This brief act of mindfulness helps give my brain a split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement to address the behavior . " <h> Tissues and sanitizer <p> Keep clean tissues nearby along with small bottles of hand sanitizer . The tissue can be used as a barrier to scratch a tickle near the nose or eyes . <p> " That 's totally good as long as it 's a fresh tissue that has n't been in your pocket and as long as you keep contaminated away from uncontaminated , " McCarthy said . <p> " Do n't flip the Kleenex from front to back because in using it , that can put viral particles on the tissue . " <p> He also suggests hand sanitizer if you ca n't wash your hands but must touch your nose or eyes . <h> Triggers and behaviors <p> Jami Hoff is a Providence Sacred Heart occupational therapist with a degree in behavior analysis . She said people can think about identifying why they 're touching the face . <p> " Are there certain times of the day that you 're touching your face ? " Hoff said . " Are you chewing on your fingers when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the environment or situations that are triggering you to touch your face more . " <p> It 's bringing awareness and breaking the chain of behavior -- to stop and think -- beforehand , she said . In recognizing triggers , perhaps instead you grab that tissue or sanitizer first . <p> Face-touching as a behavior likely is linked to comfort and sensory input , Hoff added . " There 's not a lot you can replace touching your face with because it gives you automatic reinforcement . If you have an itch on your face , you want to scratch , and it makes you feel better . <p> " We 're not consciously aware of it unless we try to be . " <p> Ward suggested people be aware of physical triggers , as well . <p> " Identify a list of triggers , like a runny nose or the urge to sneeze , so then if you have a tissue nearby , you can grab it , or if you 're going to sneeze , aim your sneeze into your elbow , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might irritate . If you 're touching your eyes a lot , you might go with glasses during this time instead . " <h> Busy hands <p> People also can find ways to keep their hands busy , Hoff suggested . <p> " If you 're fidgeting because you 're bored , can you put your hands in your pocket ? " she said . " If you find yourself trying to touch your face during something that causes anxiety , can you have a stress ball , a coin in your hand or a stone to rub ? <p> " Maybe you can fidget with jewelry so you 're touching things other than your face or even engaging in an activity such as coloring . " <p> Ward also brought up that tools in the hand can help . " Use a stress ball , worry beads , fidget spinners that might keep hands busy and out of your face . " <h> Scents and visuals <p> A scented environmental cue can help you stop before fingers reach the face , Hoff said . " If you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you the cue to stop . " <p> Ward has heard of people putting a ribbon or rubber band around a finger as a visual reminder to avoid touching the face , but he agreed it 's often unconscious anyway . <p> " Yes , it is . This is why you can see politicians and city officials touching their faces right after they tell people not to touch their faces . You can find all those videos online . <p> " Some people have talked about using a smelly hand sanitizer or lotion because the smell might remind them . " <h> Calm and common sense <p> McCarthy said that in recent weeks , he has avoided touching high-contact surfaces such as step handrails . <p> " When I wash my hands and leave the restroom , I use the paper towel to touch the doorknob , " he said . " These are things I do . " <p> " It 's long been a strong social custom when I come into an exam room to shake the patient 's hand . Do we need to rethink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and human connection ? <p> " Again , I wash hands before I go into any exam , but I have n't been shaking hands all week in clinic . " <p> However , Ward said the overall prevention strategies against infections are practical to use all the time . <p> " I do n't know that we should obsessively worry or stress about this , " he said . <p> " I think we should wash our hands frequently , but every year we 're facing dangerous viruses . The key is to eat healthy , rest , exercise , take natural immune boosters like zinc and Vitamin C and wash hands for 20 seconds . <p> " These are all pieces of the formula we come back to every year multiple times . " <p> McCarthy also returned to good hygiene and flu-season strategies as COVID-19 threatens . That includes being mindful of potential viral particles both in the air and on surfaces , he said . <p> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby , or possibly be inhaled . <p> The agency says it is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth , nose , or possibly their eyes , but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads . <p> " I do n't think we 're going to eradicate this -- we 're just going to slow the progression " of COVID-19 , McCarthy said .

Mitt Romney is among a bipartisan group of lawmakers demanding that President Donald Trump explain why he fired the intelligence community inspector general . <p> The eight senators , led by Sen.

The president cited a lack of confidence in the intelligence community 's top watchdog . <p> " Congressional intent is clear that an expression of lost confidence , without further explanation , is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the statute , " the senators wrote in a letter Thursday . " This is in large part because Congress intended that inspectors general only be removed when there is clear evidence of wrongdoing or failure to perform the duties of the office , and not for reasons unrelated to their performance , to help preserve IG independence .

The senators also raised concern about Atkinson being immediately placed on paid administrative leave , effectively removing him from his post prior to the 30-day expiration . <h> Related : <p> President Donald Trump on Friday abruptly fired the inspector general of the intelligence community , sidelining an independent watchdog who played a pivotal role in his impeachment even as his White House struggled with the deepening coronavirus pandemic . <p> Trump has taken an aggressive stance toward inspectors general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's watchdog over a report that revealed medical supply shortages and coronavirus testing issues across the country , according to Politico . <p> The president also removed the acting Pentagon inspector general , Glenn Fine , shortly after he was named to lead a watchdog panel overseeing implementation of the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package that Congress approved last month . <p> Last week , Romney and other senators from both parties urged the president to ensure the independence of the special inspector general for pandemic recovery -- a position they worked into the rescue bill and to provide Congress with details about its plans for rigorous oversight . <p> Trump ignited controversy when he signaled in a signing statement attached to the bill that his White House would supervise reports to Congress from the special inspector general for coronavirus relief . <p> Congress created inspectors general to combat waste , fraud and abuse , and to be independent watchdogs over federal agencies ' use of taxpayer dollars . <p> In Thursday 's letter , the senators underscore the role inspectors general play in holding agencies accountable and outlined removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The senators say it is their responsibility to confirm that there are clear , substantial reasons for firing an inspector general , and want Trump to provide a more detailed explanation about removing Atkinson no later than Monday .

More than 90% of the nation 's population is under some kind of stay-at-home order . <p> That 's been devastating to the restaurant industry , which the National Restaurant Association has forecast will lose up to 7 million jobs , but it 's created optimism among some food manufacturers . <p> Conagra Brands , whose broad portfolio includes Healthy Choice , Slim Jim , Chef Boyardee and a big frozen foods business , raised its guidance for the year after seeing a significant bump in sales that it expects to continue through at least April . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head back to the office and restaurants open again , but many shoppers Conagra never anticipated attracting are trying its products for the first time , which is an opportunity to turn them into long-term customers , CEO Sean Connolly said . <p> Because people are consuming every meal at home , demand is up across categories , he said . Panicked shoppers first were buying canned goods , but then they moved to frozen vegetables and single-serve frozen meals that people can pop into the microwave for lunch . Snacks are now seeing the fastest daily sales growth , he said . <p> " The priority right now is producing the maximum amount of food that we can possibly produce , " Connolly told investors on a conference call last week . <p> The company has shifted employees from its food service production lines , where demand has dropped drastically because of mandated temporary restaurant closures , to the lines making products sold in grocery stores .. Its planned rollouts of new products are being put on hold at some retailers that want to focus on core staples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on shelves as companies focus on churning out the most in-demand products , said Geoff Freeman , CEO of the Consumer Brands Association , an industry trade group . Unilever has said some variations of its products may be unavailable as it focuses on its most popular sizes of Hellman 's mayonnaise and flavors of Knorr meal mixes . <p> " There will be no shortage of product , " Freeman said . " Product will be there , but perhaps not some of our choice . " <p> The adjustments have not been easy . Shifting production from food service to retail involves different packaging and distribution channels . The Food and Drug Administration relaxed labeling rules to remove some of the hurdles . <p> More challenges lie ahead given stretched supplies of sanitation and personal protective equipment , which are important for food production , Freeman said . There is also potential for supply chain disruptions if imported raw ingredients do n't make it in or trucks ca n't get food to shelves fast enough . <p> So far , Conagra has been able to meet 90% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close eye on the supply chain . His biggest concern " is always the unknown , " he said , of which there is plenty in this unprecedented situation . <p> " We do our best to anticipate what is coming our way , " he said . " But nobody understands what 's coming our way . " <h> Keeping workers safe <p> One of the biggest unknowns food manufacturers are bracing for is what happens if employees contract COVID-19 . <p> PepsiCo temporarily closed a Frito-Lay plant in California as a precaution after several employees showed symptoms , and halted several production lines at a Quaker Oats plant in Iowa when a worker there tested positive . <p> Conagra had one plant employee who tested positive and is recovering , and another who is suspected to have the illness , Connolly said . The company followed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to quarantine the individuals and disinfect the premises . <p> Food manufacturers , which already have extensive sanitation policies , have instituted additional cleaning regimens to try to keep workers from getting sick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production and distribution facilities in Illinois , is doing temperature checks as workers arrive for their shifts . <p> Proven Partners Group , an Illinois-based contract food manufacturer and packager with several large clients and about 250 employees , has staggered breaks so different crews do n't mingle , said CEO Suley Muratoglu . As it shifts production to accommodate spiking demand for high-nutrition products for seniors , the plant also has reduced the number of people on the production floor at a time to create more distance between them . <p> Most large companies are relaxing attendance policies , so people are n't discouraged from staying home if they feel ill , and adding paid sick or quarantine leave . They also are promising perks to reward employees for continuing to come to work despite the risks . <p> Conagra and Tyson are each offering plant workers a $500 one-time bonus . PepsiCo , which is trying to hire 6,000 workers , is paying $100 more per week to 90,000 employees and guaranteeing 12 weeks of pay if a plant closes because of COVID-19 . <p> Oreo-maker Mondelez International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering a temporary $2 per hour raise through May 2 . Kraft Heinz is providing a $100 weekly premium to nearly 19,000 full-time and temporary employees . <p> Concerns employers expressed at the inception of the health emergency that employees would n't show up do not seem to be playing out , Freeman said . Muratoglu , who is hiring , said he has seen a spike in job applications , some from laid-off restaurant workers , whereas before the pandemic he struggled to find labor . <p> Bob O'Toole , president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1546 , said the concerns he hears most from workers are about finding child care amid school closures . In addition , a growing number of union members are being laid off from meat processing plants that supplied restaurants , conventions , airlines and cruise ships , and do n't have the right licenses to pivot to retail . <p> Still , many food production employees are worried about going to work , especially at meat processing plants where they stand close together , O'Toole said . But companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , " he said . " These people are living paycheck to paycheck . " <p> Gibbs , the plant manager in Champaign for two years , said it has taken some time for employees to get used to distancing . <p> That is n't usually a problem on the highly automated production floor , where a single person can staff a line that spits out 1,700 cartons of macaroni cheese or 450 bottles of salad dressing per minute . But elsewhere , " We have to remind people from time to time that you ca n't stand on top of each other , " said Gibbs , 67 . <p> Gibbs said he holds daily meetings to address employees ' concerns and educate them about how to protect themselves . <p> " What I tell my teams is , if you think like you got it , you wo n't ever get it , " he said . <p> Housekeeping staff is cleaning doorknobs and other commonly used surfaces every four hours , and employees have been asked to do the same at their stations . <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibbs said . . But to him , keeping the factory running through the pandemic is a duty . <p> " This job we do day in and out is very important , " he said , " especially because we make a product that people can afford . " <h> Long-term impact <p> Whether the pandemic-driven shifts in consumer behavior are here to stay remains to be seen . <p> As layoffs continue and economic pressures mount , low-priced foods may continue to be enticing , Rabobank 's Fereday said . But the experience also may make consumers particularly protective of their health and willing to invest in products that tout their nutritional value , he said . <p> Some long-term impacts on the food industry are starting to show . The share of Americans buying groceries online or using delivery services like Instacart or Amazon Fresh had risen to 39% as of this week , up from 18% four weeks earlier , according to a survey from the Consumer Brands Association . <p> And the lean , efficient supply chains companies have adopted to save money also are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event of an emergency , Fereday said . There will likely be a move toward de-globalizing the supply chain in favor of local suppliers , he said . <p> Other consequences depend on how long COVID-19 upends people 's lives . <p> Smaller , emerging brands that have pitched themselves as premium products could be in for some difficult times if people go back to basics , Fereday said . <p> Big Food 's focus in recent years on growing through innovation and new product launches could take a back seat if companies simplify their portfolios , reducing choice , said Bahige El-Rayes , a partner in the consumer practice at strategy and management consulting firm Kearney . <p> El-Rayes also wonders if the mass cooking-at-home experiment could change how often people dine out , returning restaurants to a once-in-a-while treat rather than the everyday occasion they had become . Even when life begins to move more normally again , he said , it 's likely people 's wariness to gather will linger for a while .

In an interview last week , Lewis said he still believes that would be the better course . <p> Lewis , challenging Democratic U.S. Sen.

" I do n't support discrimination against anyone , but the origin of the virus is an epidemiological fact , " he said . The outbreak should motivate the U.S. government to vastly downscale its reliance on resources and goods produced in China , he said . <p> Smith said she , too , has concerns that some U.S. supply chains are overreliant on Chinese labor .

He said he hopes to benefit from GOP donors who see Minnesota as a pickup opportunity given imperiled Republican Senate incumbents in a handful of blue states . <p> " There 's this slate of Senate candidates who are going to be in the fight of their lives , so we better find some states we can flip , " Lewis said . <p> " I 'm angry they were so slow and ineffective in getting these tests deployed , " Smith said .

Having suffered in the past due to racism and racial violence , we can not continue on this dangerous path . Hatred and disinformation are damaging our collective future -- Pic by Shehan Gunasekara <p> Appearing on a widely - watched televised discussion on 10 April , Public Health Inspectors ' ( PHI ) Union of Sri Lanka Chairman Upul Rohana made a grossly inaccurate and deliberately misleading statement : " If not for the last three patients , " he claimed , " Sri Lankans could have celebrated Avurudu this year too as we do every year " . <p> In short , because of three COVID-19 patients , all Sri Lankans are unable to celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the host to name the localities , the PHI cited Naththandiya ( Puttalam District ) , Akurana ( Kandy District ) and Beruwala ( Kalutara District ) , and confidently maintained that if not for these three individuals , Sri Lanka would be a happy place today . <p> The insinuation was clear . Sri Lankans suffering from the novel coronavirus was easily attributable to three persons from Muslim-majority areas , in other words , to Muslims . It was a message that would have been picked up only too easily by all those watching the program , and already conditioned by powerful sections of the media to think that Muslims are primarily responsible for the spread of COVID-19 in the country . There was no mention of where the deadly virus originated or how the virus entered Sri Lanka . The returnees from Italy and South Korea who went into hiding were rightly spared any derision and all but wrongly forgotten . <p> The stupefying claim of the chief of the country 's Public Health Inspectors was a terrible blow to the PHIs and other health officials who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflicted patients since the first Sri Lankan patient was diagnosed on 10 March . It gives credence to the regrettable rumours among minorities that some of the officials are indeed hostile to patients from their communities . Union leaders without stoking hatred at this critical time should have requested the government to reward the stressed frontline health workers , to contain the virus , by paying twice what the government had decided to pay police personnel . <p> The patients ' database of Sri Lanka 's COVID19 tracker ( https : //covidsl.com/ ) shows that four COVID19 confirmed cases were reported on 8 April including two from Mudduwa ( Ratnapura District ) and one from Akkaraipattu ( Ampara District ) . The location of the day 's fourth confirmed case is not specified in this database . On 9 April , one detection was reported , that of a female patient from Beruwala . A single glance at this database is sufficient to rubbish the PHI 's claims as false , misleading and utterly irresponsible . <p> The Police has warned that legal action will be taken against those spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action will be taken against this officer for spreading disinformation , and in effect damaging our national and collective interests , at such a critical time in our country 's history ? What are the chances that any of those in positions of power who violate the law will be held accountable ? Do n't they bear greater responsibility than ordinary citizens ? <p> The PHI 's claims which was widely discussed on social media as well , represents a flagrant violation of the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services on April 2nd , 2020 for COVID-19 reporting ( http : **40;428;TOOLONG ... The first guideline , of the eight , is to " only report verified and accurate information on COVID-19 " . Another guideline is that the race or religion of patients or those who die from the disease should not be reported . It calls on the fourth estate to report on COVID-19 " in a positive manner so as to build cooperation and support among people in dealing with the disease , " and not in " in a manner that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also warned that if these guidelines are ignored , it could lead to a dangerous situation where patients would fear to come forward fearing stigmatisation . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has also urged countries to refrain from profiling COVID19 cases along religious lines . " This does not help . Having COVID-19 is not anybody 's fault . Every case is a victim . It is very important that we do not profile the cases on the basis of racial , religious and ethnic lines , " Dr. Mike Ryan , WHO Emergency Programme Director emphasised on April 6th . Unfortunately sections of the island 's media do not give coverage to such views . <p> On the one hand the health authorities , supported by the media , have been urging people to reach out and seek treatment at an early stage without hiding symptoms , and refrain from shaming those who have contracted COVID-19 . On the other hand , they jointly vilify COVID-19 patients . When there is victim shaming , is it reasonable to expect others to come forward ? How does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be successfully eliminated when health authorities themselves dehumanise the unfortunate victims of this virus , as if they willingly contracted it ; even if any of them had been neglectful ? <p> When racist groups have taken advantage of people 's fears to further demonise Muslims through disinformation , the PHI Union 's chief too thought it fit to join the anti-Muslim propaganda bandwagon and add fuel to fire , thus tainting what has largely been a highly commendable response to the COVID-19 crisis from the Sri Lankan health and other authorities . <p> In Scotland , the Chief Medical Officer Dr. Catherine Calderwood resigned following revelations that she had made two trips to her second home during the coronavirus lockdown , practising the opposite of what she had preached , and later apologised unreservedly for her actions . Can we ever expect such standards from our public servants ? <p> Racist narratives contribute to hatred , and hatred has disastrous consequences .

Hatred and disinformation are damaging our collective future . <p> Several Muslim organisations lodged a written complaint on 11 April to the Acting Inspector General of Police asking for an investigation into the continued hate campaign against Muslims . They had forwarded an anonymous voice recording currently in public circulation , in which the speaker alleges that Muslims are wilfully spreading COVID-19 and makes a racist appeal to listeners to boycott Muslim-owned businesses . They have argued that the content of the said audio amount to offences under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) as well as other laws . <p> Sri Lanka now has to grapple with the colossal economic fall-out from the novel coronavirus induced catastrophe , though the numbers are , thankfully as yet , much less than many other countries .

Is the kitchen clean ? Have you changed your sheets since we went into lockdown ? Have you vacuumed ? Are you taking that rubbish out ? <p> For most of us , this reads like nagging or normal domestic banter . But for a lot of New Zealanders this important work gets done only with the help of a paid care and support worker . <p> And right now , the people who help care for and support tens of thousands of New Zealanders are under extreme pressure . Perhaps they 're caring for their own children , or they 're immunocompromised . Perhaps they 're over 70 themselves . Perhaps they 're at odds with their employer about safe travel , or being paid for the hours they work , or are simply too scared to leave their homes at all . <p> In recent weeks , my union colleagues and I have spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers facing those kinds of risks . <p> Many employers have responded by providing flexible working conditions and special leave entitlements . Unions have worked alongside their members to secure access to personal protective equipment ( PPE ) and with government on the need for greater leave support . <p> But essential workers are having their heads turned by talk of bonus payments that acknowledge the extremities of the Covid-19 working environment . <p> The idea that risky work ought to be recognised seems reasonable . Why should n't our essential workers get paid extra for leaving the house at a time like this ? <p> There is a very good reason : employers have a responsibility to acknowledge and act on risk in workplaces , not trade it away . Unions have a responsibility to ensure workers do n't have to settle for sub-standard conditions . <p> It 's not that danger pay comes from a bad place , it 's that it sets a dangerous precedent . <p> It can encourage risk-taking and tolerance toward unsafe situations rather than incentivising employers to eliminate , minimise or isolate these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , play on the desperation of low-paid workers to increase their pay at the expense of their health and safety . <p> Unions have fought hard against the practice of paying people extra for unsafe or dangerous work for decades .

It was called an " obnoxious substance " payment . <p> In 2020 , we 're not taking that anymore . <p> The protection of our workers ' health and safety stands on its own and ca n't be sold for higher wages . <p> It 's fine to have a conversation about increasing people 's base pay -- but let 's not muddy the waters by conflating two vital conversations . <p> For me , at least some good will come out of this lockdown if society ends up placing increased value on essential work . <p> This crisis is showing us just how skewed our value of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sexism , racism and ageism within our society all get reflected in that market , where power and influence trump actual public value . <p> Let 's move past those constructs based on societal discrimination .

Even assuming there is no slippage and the January 7 , 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President holds , questions remain as to what the current uncertainties mean for the EC 's election calendar . <p> What options are available to the EC and the country as the situation evolves ? What does a worst-case scenario look like and how should it be addressed ? This blog dissects these issues and examines the options available to the EC and the country . <p> When is the latest date for holding the elections ? <p> Articles 63 and 112 of the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Ghana sets the timelines for holding presidential and parliamentary elections . Article 63(2) ( a ) requires the presidential election to take place " ... not earlier than four months nor later than a month before the term of office expires , " while , per article 112 ( 4 ) , parliamentary elections must be held ' within thirty days before the expiration of a Session of Parliament . ' <p> In essence , parliamentary elections must happen at least one month before Parliament is dissolved , which currently falls on January 6 of a new year . Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held together since 1996 , the combined effect of the applicable constitutional provisions puts the time for organizing both elections ( whether separately or concurrently ) sometime during the month of December 2020 . <p> If the presidential and parliamentary election were separated , a presidential election could theoretically be held as early as September 2020 , as this would fall within the four months to the expiration of the presidential term stipulated under Article 63 . <p> In practice , however , given the EC 's usual calendar of election-year activities and where things currently stand , it would be nearly impossible to hold this year 's elections any time earlier than the usual December 7 . The challenge for the EC is how to undertake and complete all the activities necessary to deliver free , fair and credible elections while sticking to the December 7 schedule . <p> What is the latest period a voter register can be compiled to allow for the other electoral activities to proceed ? <p> Take the compilation of a voter register . All things being equal , it should take about 86 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registration process to the final process of certifying the voter register . <p> The process of collecting the biographical and biometric data of prospected voters takes about 44 days . Unlike Election Day where the EC uses all 30,000-plus polling stations to serve voters , for voter registration , the EC clusters registration centers ( normally about five in each cluster ) , with registration officials assigned to a cluster moving from one registration center to the other during the registration period , spending about eight days at each center ( during the 2012 compilation of the voter register , EC staff spent 10 days at each center ) . <p> The EC adopts this method because it is working with a limited quantity of registration kits ( 8,000 ) for an estimated 17 to 18 million voters . <p> During the registration process , a registrant whose eligibility to be registered is challenged at the registration center has to go before the District Registration Review Committee ( DDRC ) for the complaint to be adjudicated . The DDRC normally sits for 14 days . <p> After collecting the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be exhibited for 14 days for the public to verify their details , make corrections or object to any unqualified applicant . <p> Any objections made during the exhibition has to be taken to a Magistrate for final adjudication . The EC then effects all corrections and does a final cleaning of the provisional voter register before the register is certified ( ready ) for elections . This last process takes another 14 days to complete . <p> The 86 days does not include all the other preparatory work that the EC must do to get ready for the commencement of registration . In this case , it will depend on when the new registration kits are expected to arrive in the country and how long it will take for it to be processed for deployment , tested and configured with the new software . At a demonstration at the Coconut Grove Regency Hotel in Accra in December 2019 , prospective vendors were expected to manufacture , deliver , set up and test the kits within a five-month period . The EC only awarded the contract for the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting an estimated operational date sometime in June or July 2020 at the latest . Of course , these processes can be fast tracked but it means there is little room for error . In addition , it will depend on whether or not all these processes would have to be done while COVID-19-induced restrictions are in place or even if they have been lifted , whether the fear of infection remains a national threat . <p> Following the EC 's announcement to postpone the registration date and the extension of the lockdown , it is more likely that the earliest the EC can hope to go to the field would be early or mid-May 2020 . This is based on the expectation that the first batch of kits ( 4,000 ) would arrive around this time for the registration to start . This would mean that the main part of compiling the register is likely to be completed at the end of July or early August . Again , this does not factor in the real threat of a constitutional challenge to the EC 's decision to limit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghana Card and a Passport and rejecting its own Voter Identity Card used in the 2016 elections and the just ended December 2019 District Assembly Elections . An amendment to the Public Elections ( Registration of Voters ) , 2016 ( Constitutional Instrument ( CI 91 ) currently in Parliament is expected to mature once the 21 days ' sittings of Parliament requirement is met , unless two-thirds majority of Members of Parliament ( MPs ) annul the CI before it matures . <p> In essence , May is the cutoff point . Any scenario that considers June as a start date increases significantly the risk of jeopardizing the rest of the election calendar . A May start for registration means that by September , all things being equal , nomination of aspirants can be taken . Taking nominations in September will be consistent with Regulation 4 of Public Elections Regulation , 2016 ( CI 94 ) , which stipulates that the Commission of the EC shall issue a Writ of Elections to the returning officer ( the EC Chair ) specifying when nominations will be taken and elections should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not less than thirty days or more than ninety days after the last day appointed for the nomination of candidates . " Therefore , if elections are to be held on December 7 , the earliest time to take nominations will be on September 8 , 2020 and latest by November 7 , 2020 . <p> Technically , unless the EC has certified an aspirant as a candidate for the election ( presidential and parliamentary ) they can not formally campaign . Most aspirants will not have a problem but it is a risk that is avoided by aspirants before they go and invest in campaigns . The problem is that the EC can not take nominations if the register is not certified . CI 94 , which regulates Public Elections , requires a nomination form for parliamentary elections to be witnessed by two registered voters and supported by 18 others . Presidential election nominations additional stipulations but also require , at the minimum , two registered voters in each district to witness . <p> Going by the calendar , if nominations are taken in September or even October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominations , the EC can then focus on using the last six to eight weeks to work on the balloting for positions , transfer of votes , recruitment of temporary officers , training , printing of ballot papers and registers , procuring other logistics , special voting and prepping for Election Day . A June start pushes nominations close to October and then compresses the time for everything else . This leaves no room for making mistakes and correcting them and at the same time puts enormous pressure on delivering a credible election , a situation that is likely to produce more disputation and possible litigation . <p> Implications of a late voter registration exercise within a COVID-19 context on campaigning and turnout <p> The current scenarios already compress the time for campaigning . If nominations are taken in October , we are looking at between five to six weeks of official campaigning . Apart from the logistical nightmare of crisscrossing 16 regions , the campaigns must also find time for critical public engagement and interrogation of manifestoes and policy proposals of their candidates . The strong likelihood of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing threat or fear of getting infected with COVID-19 further complicates the picture . This last risk could also produce an unusually low turnout for the registration exercise . Commencement of registration in May means that registration would be taking place at a time the COVID-19 outbreak is not likely to have been fully contained or suppressed , creating a risk or fear of infection for citizens who might want to get registered . If , under those circumstances , the EC decides to proceed with registration , causing citizens to choose between their health and their right to vote , this might give rise to a legal challenge and further set back the clock . <p> The risk of a low turnout was already a concern before COVID-19 . In the recent Round 8 Afrobarometer survey in Ghana released in October 2019 , 11% of respondents did not intend to vote in the coming elections . This the highest percentage recorded since 2008 . Similar sentiments were widely expressed in the lead-up to the failed December 2019 constitutional amendment referendum , including in middle class social media circles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contemporary Ghanaian party politics appeared to cause many voters to withdraw from the electoral process entirely . Any additional obstacles in the way of registration , such as the risk or fear of contracting COVID-19 , is likely to further depress voter interest in the exercise . An unusually low turnout can produce a voter register that is legal but not deemed credible , creating other legitimacy problems for the elections . <p> Options for the EC in a Second-Best to Worse Case Scenario <p> An optimal scenario was for the EC to start registration in April . That option is obviously off the table now , leaving only a second-best and a worst-case scenario to consider . A second-best scenario envisages the EC starting in May 2020 . The EC would be time-pressed but it can still pull it off , albeit with very little room to make mistakes and correct them in time or to deal with legal challenges . The EC could utilize the Inter Party Advisory Committee ( IPAC ) to build consensus and understanding and thus minimize the risk of litigation . Recourse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreements , notably over the decision of the EC to make a Ghana passport and the card from the uncompleted Ghana Card process the only acceptable ID for establishing citizenship . This decision , which , essentially , rejects the EC 's own officially issued voter card used in the most recent elections , including the December 2019 District Assembly Elections , is almost certain to be challenged . The EC would be well advised to reverse that decision , as it is hard to sustain . <p> The other problem with the second-best scenario arises from the COVID-19 context . To commence registration in May means that EC registration staff , both temporary and permanent staff , would have to wear appropriate protective gear , enforce strict physical ( social ) distancing rules , and post Veronica Buckets and sanitizers at each registration center . This means additional cost , most certainly unbudgeted . Encouraging and mobilizing people to come out to register is going to be doubly difficult , requiring a good deal more civic education than usual . Dealing with these unanticipated Coronavirus-related challenges will further slowdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected 44 days by an additional week at the minimum , depending on the turnout . <p> These election cycle challenges arising out of COVID-19 are , of course , not limited to Ghana . Many other countries are grappling with the same issues . The International Foundation for Electoral Systems ( IFES ) reports that as at April 3 , 2020 , a number of African countries , including Nigeria , Ethiopia , Kenya , South Africa , and Cameroon , have cancelled or postponed various elections on account of COVID-19 . A few other Election Management Bodies have braved the COVID-19 outbreak to organize election . In one such country , Mali , hand-washing basins were provided and one-meter barriers were set up between voters with election officials wearing masks and gloves . Not surprisingly , domestic election observers able to observe the Malian elections reported that these measures were followed in less than 50% of the cases . <p> In the " worst-case " scenario , registration will begin in June 2020 . In that event , the EC will have to consider seriously an alternative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean a much more limited voter registration exercise , one that is likely restricted to first-time eligible voters and other first timers . With that , the EC can estimate to add about one to one and half million voters to the current register . This limited registration could take 10 to 14 days . The only stumbling block to this Plan B is that the EC would have to negotiate with STL , the former hardware and software supplier , to obtain access to the biometric template that allows the EC to access fingerprint data . As explained by the EC in its many briefings , it already has the biographical data of all the 15 million-plus voters from the 2016 to 2019 register so it will be easy to migrate that data into the new system . A limited voter registration would cut the registration process down by at least four weeks and that would position the EC in a position similar to the " second best " scenario . This has to be a real option , one that the EC must plan for . All other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The EC and all election stakeholders are in uncharted waters at the moment . Every Election Management Body and country must take those actions that fit their context and peculiar circumstances . Considering what is at stake , it is a task that should be done with as much consultation and consensus building to save unnecessary and time-consuming disputation down the line and ultimately ensure that citizens can participate in the democratic process safely and with a high degree of confidence that the ensuing elections will be peaceful , free , fair and credible . <p> Kojo Pumpuni Asante ( PhD ) is the Director for Advocacy and Policy Engagement at the Ghana Center for Democratic Development ( CDD-Ghana )

Entrants will be able to play each other in the latest versions of NBA 2K , Madden , FIFA , NHL , MLB : The Show and Rocket League , a soccer game involving cars . <p> " We get a pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> He said the league allows students to play any other entrant at any time and that students must play five games a week .

As a musician , she said leaving school was tough , because it meant missing rehearsals , recitals and lessons . <p> The program , she said , has helped her natural competitive nature , and she 's run 40 miles since the beginning of the program . <p> " I 'm just trying to keep up and stay active , " she said . <p> Horner , unable to play his favorite sport in person , is playing in the online FIFA league and has enjoyed it so far despite a 6-0 loss in his first game .

Here , they rest on the railway track on April 2 .

Photo : Emmanual Yogini <p> At Ring Road near Basai Darapur in New Delhi on March 30 , a migrant worker , along with his child , on his way to his hometown during the lockdown . Photo : Shiv Kumar Pushpakar <p> The lockdown has only exposed the existing problem of the devalued and invisibilised labour of 100 million internal migrant workers and an economy that can not ensure their sustenance and safety in the regions they work . <p> Naim* and his co-workers , migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh , live on Khairani Road , a densely packed industrial hub in Sakinaka in Mumbai ( Maharashtra ) , where at least one large fire has destroyed lives , wages , and documentation every year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Bablu , who run units producing flammable material , forbid smoking onsite , let alone cooking . But now , to survive the shutting down of neighbourhood dhabas ( where they usually eat ) and the militant enforcement of the lockdown by the police , Naim and his colleagues are compelled to put themselves at the mercy of the same fire hazards that , just three months ago , took two lives and destroyed 30 units just a 20-minute walk away . <p> Bablu , a marginal producer himself , has seen his earnings diminish because of the lockdown and is running out of rations and money to feed his workers , compelling Naim to cook in hazardous conditions . According to estimates by Aajeevika Bureau** -- a labour organisation that works with informal and migrant workers -- 70 per cent of the workers live on such high-risk worksites : cramped and poorly ventilated , where they sleep -- and now spend their entire days -- near old , hazardous , second-hand industrial machines , including metal cutters , power-presses , and drilling machines . <p> In Ahmedabad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Rajasthan who worked as daily-wage labour in the construction sector , had gone out of work a few days prior to the announcement of the lockdown . In the city , they live in an informal rental space , where 15-20 workers cram themselves into single , unventilated rooms -- the most premium of which are 10x12 feet in size going at the rate of Rs.500 per worker . Many of the workers sleep on the tin roofs of the rooms , while others squeeze themselves in the hollows of the walls meant for storage . For them , the lockdown means spending 24 hours jam-packed into these cowshed-converted rooms in the scorching heat . The rooms do not have sanitation or water , but their occupants run the risk of police harassment if they step out . Their landlord , a local Rabari , from the cattle-rearing community , relies solely on the rent from migrant workers , and the ration shop that he runs , which caters exclusively to these groups . He can not afford to lose out on rent or supply rations for free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a homeless shelter but were turned away . They were asked for their identity documents , told that they were not homeless , and that the shelter did not have capacity . There are roughly 1.3 million migrant workers in Ahmedabad , according to Aajeevika 's estimates . Left without other options , many of them set out to their villages on foot . As a result , over 40,000 migrants had congregated at the Gujarat-Rajasthan border in Ratanpur on March 25 . <h> The long march home <p> Since the Central government announced the 21-day nationwide lockdown , along with the suspension of all transportation and the strict sealing of inter-State borders as a precaution against the spread of COVID-19 infection , Aajeevika 's labour helpline has been ringing continuously . It logs an average of 200 distress calls daily from migrant workers who have been left without work , wages , food , water and , sometimes , shelter . <p> The announcement for a lockdown came without any prior notice for the estimated 100 million internal migrant workers in the country . In a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even larger , humanitarian crisis , the toll of which was borne by the most vulnerable sections of its population . So desperate were these workers to leave the cities and towns where they worked that they left in scores to their villages on foot , braving hunger and thirst , the scorching summer sun , police harassment , forested areas , and the threat of disease and death . Those who could not leave called helplines in desperation , seeking food , supplies and shelter , or begging to simply be transported back to their villages . Many were stuck at borders , forming large crowds , where they were stranded , sprayed with disinfectants , or asked to provide " health certificates " which they had no means to procure , before being allowed to enter their home States . <p> This is not an unanticipated event . For decades , internal migrants toiling in cities have remained uncounted in national statistics , excluded from urban governance facilities and services , and unrecognised either as workers or as citizens by their employers or governments . Before announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic growth model -- based on high-growth sectors and world-class infrastructure in large urban agglomerations -- is built through the labour of rural-urban migrants . <p> Like Naim and Ramlal , migrants live in informal and unrecognised spaces in cities . This includes worksites , with workers living inside construction sites , small manufacturing units , hotels and dhabas or headloading markets , often in peripheral and isolated industrial locations . Some migrants live in informal rented accommodation with no rental contracts , at the mercy of extractive local landlords , who charge them arbitrary rents for a few facilities . Many live in the open to save on rent -- on pavements , under flyovers , near railway tracks or on private or public land . <p> While worksites and industrial areas remain outside the jurisdiction of urban local bodies , informal rental spaces are often on illegally held land , which are not regulated by the state . Migrants living in open spaces , on the other hand , interact with the state only during evictions by the municipal authorities or the police , where their assets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for alternative accommodation . When asked about migrants ' access to basic public provisioning in the city , officials from the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation responded thus : " We can only provide for ' taxpaying ' residents and our resources are limited . The industry should be responsible for the labour they bring . " <p> However , distress calls from migrants across the country reveal a different story -- industry hires migrants precisely because they can cut costs and remain competitive by not providing for their welfare . In many cases , employers such as Bablu are themselves marginal , taking cheap orders with very small profit margins from large dealers who then aggregate and sell these products in domestic or international markets . Without orders , they are likely to face cash and ration shortages themselves . They pass on the losses to their workers by cutting wages and benefits . <p> Where employers are large and work-units themselves are organised , migrant workers are still hired on a casual or contractual basis . In a cement company in Kutch , 5,000 migrants called the helpline demanding rations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were hired through a labour contractor . While the main contractor had fled to Ahmedabad before the lockdown , the petty contractor was unable to provide rations to a large number of workers . While he gave advances to some workers to purchase rations , they did not know how much would be deducted from their wages when work was resumed . When the local administration and the police were apprised of the matter , they made the petty contractor sign an agreement to arrange rations , as the labourers were his responsibility . <p> With a large number of intermediaries between employers and migrant workers , they find it hard to identify the employer or even the company that hires them , remaining solely dependent on the petty contractor . Many more migrant workers are labelled as " self-employed " but in reality are piece-rate or home-based workers . For instance , the garments industry in Narol , Ahmedabad , employs a large number of migrant women who work from their tiny rooms or in small units to stitch buttons , cut extra thread from textiles or sew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large international brands . They receive work from local agents who pay them a marginal amount based on their output . The lockdown has meant a loss of orders , and these women workers are left with no employer to ask for their wages . When the government announced that employers must pay wages to workers despite the suspension of work , migrant workers were left without standard work contracts or identifiable employers to pay them . <h> Little relief <p> Similarly , the Garib Kalyan Yojana announced by the Finance Ministry and the slew of measures promised by different States provided little relief to migrant workers . Despite these announcements that have been presented as adequate to assuage their fears , they continued to leave in hordes to their villages . In its report to the Supreme Court , the government attributed migrants ' continued exodus from urban areas to misinformation and fake news which spread panic . <p> What went unsaid was that the relief packages relied on advancing the benefits under welfare schemes based on the existing lists of beneficiaries . Migrant workers do not make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents in the cities they work in because their living spaces are un-enumerated or unrecognised by urban local bodies , which view them as " illegal " or outside their scope . Without documents to prove that they are " residents " of the city , they can not access free ration from the public distribution system ( PDS ) or demand water and sanitation in their living spaces . <p> The Labour Ministry has announced that cess funds collected by the Building and Other Construction Workers ' Welfare Boards ( BoCWWB ) would be used to transfer money to registered construction workers . However , in many States , dysfunctional welfare boards and complex documentation requirements result in migrant workers being unable to register themselves as construction workers . <p> Furthermore , women make up a large section of construction workers for whom access to BoCWWB registration is even more challenging . They are rarely identified as independent workers , but hired as a family unit , along with a male relative , who is then paid the wages for 1.5 labour units . This is inspite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrant workers and the second largest employer of women in the country . As a solution , some States have opened free meal kitchens , but migrants , socially , culturally and geographically excluded from central city areas where these kitchens are set up , do not have the information or means to reach them during lockdown , and where overcrowding of local populations for accessing food is also a problem . <h> Police brutality <p> As a response to the crisis , the Ministry of Home Affairs released an order on March 29 asking States to prevent the exodus of migrants by ensuring that they have rations and shelter , receive their wages and do not have to pay rent . However , it did not prescribe how these measures are to be operationalised . On the contrary , the order has had the effect of increasing police brutality towards migrants . <p> Two days after the order was passed , the helpline received a call from a group of 120 workers who were attempting to return from Karnataka and Maharashtra to their villages in Rajasthan . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who questioned and brutally assaulted them before stuffing them into a container truck that was to take them back across the border . Suffocated inside the truck , they began banging the insides , due to which the truck driver abandoned them on the road in Palghar district , Maharashtra . The group included women and children , and was left without basic supplies or any means to get anywhere to seek shelter . <p> Interestingly , when Sanchit , who arrived in Mumbai from Jharkhand only a month ago to work in an automobile parts assembly line , found himself without food since the factory 's mess had closed down and approached his employer , he was given a singular response : Why did n't you go home as well ? He explained , " Everyone else was local , so they had no issues , they just went back home . It was just us , a few from Jharkhand , others from West Bengal and Odisha , and one from Bihar -- we were stuck . " Similarly , Dolaram , who was stopped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked : " Why are you still in the city , everything is going to be closed for the next 2-3 months . " <h> Unjust system <p> With short notice and little means to act independently , urban local bodies are unable to identify and reach out to migrants who have been systematically excluded from both citizenship and labour rights in their work destinations . While each of these stories reveals particular mental , physical and emotional tolls , they all point out to migrant workers ' dependence on informal networks to access sustenance in the cities . Left out by the state and abandoned by their employers , migrants rely on their small employers , petty contractors or marginal landlords , who are themselves dependent on incomes earned through the exploitation of migrant workers for their subsistence . Without work and wages , migrants can not afford to purchase minimum consumption from these informal networks that cater to them . Even ordinarily excluded from public provisioning -- their ability to sustain in the city has been exacerbated by the pandemic and lockdown . Those that they depend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage losses , closed enterprises , and scarce food in the markets . <p> In other words , the pandemic has revealed a centuries-old system , where the poor contest the poor for access to scarce and unequally distributed resources in an urban economy , which does not guarantee unconditional survival to migrant workers . The physical and mental tolls of the pandemic are therefore compounded on to the existing costs for migrants , suggesting that the movements in large numbers towards their rural homes are not exaggerated but rather are created by our very systems of employment and provisioning of food and shelter . <p> Migrant workers come from the most socially marginalised categories of citizens , over-represented by Dalits , Adivasis , Other Backward Classes ( OBCs ) and religious minorities . They also overlap with the most impoverished and vulnerable categories of the workforce , earning the lowest incomes . They form impoverished rural populations , for whom the withdrawal of state support to the agricultural sector , lack of decent rural job creation and alienation from land , water and forest resources which have been seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress migration for low wages and poor terms and conditions of work is the only means for survival . It is telling of India 's policy priorities that this vast section of its population -- 10 times larger than India 's international migrants -- was left to fend for itself , while the government took proactive measures to ensure the safe return of Indian expats before sealing off its international borders . <h> What can be done <p> The government must take urgent measures to mitigate the disastrous consequences of the pandemic and lockdown on migrant workers . As a first step , the universalisation of PDS , where migrants can access rations without residence-based identity documentation or any eligibility barriers is imperative . Safe shelters , with food and health care facilities , can alleviate the challenges faced by migrants who have been evicted from their worksites and living spaces . To be able to reach out to migrant populations , urban local bodies should identify migrant clusters in the city and regularise them for the provision of essential services such as food , water , sanitation and health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society organisations and trade unions , while police cooperation can be sought for delivery of essentials to migrant clusters , with strict orders against the harassment of workers . <p> In addition to these measures , special steps are necessary to prevent the intensification of the wage and employment crisis in the country . Legal aid cells with phone-based services at the Central and State levels will prove useful in resolving cases of non-payment or unfair deduction of wages , and forced retrenchments . In addition to this , a special relief package for micro and small enterprises will assist small and marginal producers in retaining and providing for the workers that they employ . <p> Similar to unemployment benefits under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme ( MGNREGS ) , the government must ensure the payment of minimum wages to daily-wage , piece-rate and home-based workers for the loss of work for the period of time it takes for the effects of the pandemic to get resolved . Since many migrant workers are not registered as workers or do not have operational and accessible Jan Dhan accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown has only exposed and aggravated an existing problem , that of the devalued and invisibilised labour of millions of migrant workers and an economy that demands the mobility of workers across State borders but can not ensure their sustenance and safety in the regions where they migrate for work . The recognition of their presence in cities has come too late and with catastrophic results for this invisible army behind the country 's explosive urban growth . <p> *This article uses cases which came to Aajeevika Bureau 's labour helpline , which it runs in collaboration with the Rajasthan government , since the announcement of the lockdown as well as the findings and perspectives from the organisation 's research and field operations since 2005 .

However , the government 's decision to increase the excise duty on fuel betrays an attempt to appropriate for itself the benefits that may have otherwise accrued to the citizens . @ <p> The IES explained that the actual electricity bill could be $120 million a month and with service charges pegged at an estimated $30 million , it could result in a monthly bill of $150 million . <p> The Institute went on to say that the estimation is based on the national consumption of about 1,630 gigawatts per hour for a month and an average end-user tariff of about Ghp88 per Kilowatt-hour ( kWh ) for both residential and non-residential users . <p> Per a report by citibusinessnews.com , the IES called on the government to ensure proper operations and maintenance of systems of the service providers by ensuring that all current and potential debts are cleared . <p> The IES earlier indicated that there is the likelihood of unstable power supply across the country in the coming days if the government fails to resource the service providers . <p> As part of a series of measures being implemented by the government in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus , the government announced a total absorption of electricity for the poorest of the poor . <p> It also stated that residential and commercial users would enjoy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the benchmark . <p> YEN.com.ghearlier reported that the Africa Centre for Energy Policy ( ACEP ) has raised concerns about the government 's decision to absorb 50% of the electricity bills of residential and commercial users for the next three months . <p> The Centre is convinced that the decision could be the final nail in the coffin of the debt-stricken sector which is already facing challenges . <p> ACEP revealed that the decision is likely to cost the government about GHC1 billion each month , bringing the total cost to approximately GHC3 billion . @ @ @ Case Against Waging ' War ' on the Coronavirus <p> If curbing the spread of the coronavirus is akin to being " at war , " then it is unlike any war the world has ever fought . <p> Still , the irregularity of this particular fight has n't stopped leaders from invoking wartime imagery . In China , where the outbreak was confirmed earlier this year , Xi Jinping vowed to wage a " people 's war " on the coronavirus . As the disease spread across the globe , the battle allusions followed . France 's Emmanuel Macron declared the country at war with an " invisible , elusive " enemy . Italy 's special commissioner for the coronavirus emergency said the country must equip itself for a " war economy . " British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Britons that theirs was a fight in which each and every citizen was " directly enlisted . " In the United States , Donald Trump refashioned himself as a " wartime president . " <p> By choosing to frame the pandemic in military terms , governments are clearly trying to communicate the gravity of this public-health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and personal sacrifice most nations have n't experienced in peacetime . But drawing this imperfect parallel can have the unintended consequence of causing fear and panic too . One look at the barren supermarket shelves and the surge in U.S. firearm sales suggests that it may have already had that impact . If the aim of such imagery is to compel the public to act in the national interest , framing this crisis in war terms may achieve just the opposite . In this " war , " after all , most people are n't being asked to mobilize ; they are being asked to stay home . <p> The last time the world faced a pandemic of this scale , it was in the middle of an actual war . The Spanish flu appeared during the waning months of World War I , before quickly spreading around the world , infecting a third of the global population and killing tens of millions of people . Unlike with the current pandemic , invoking wartime imagery was n't necessary to spur action against the Spanish flu . By that point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sacrifices , " Mark Honigsbaum , a medical historian and the author of The Pandemic Century , told me , noting that many countries were already united against a common enemy , Germany , " before this unseen enemy , the Spanish flu , came along . " <p> There is a long history of world leaders framing fights against disease within the context of war . From Richard Nixon 's " war on cancer " to the " Ebola wars , " politicians have invoked battle analogies to communicate the seriousness of an issue and galvanize a national response . ( The same can be said for matters that have nothing to do with disease , such as Lyndon B. Johnson 's War on Poverty and the global War on Terror . ) <p> In some ways , these wartime metaphors make sense . John Baugh , a linguist at Washington University in St. Louis , told me that when politicians and health officials invoke this language , it 's often because " they feel that the public has not yet taken the problem seriously , " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case with the coronavirus pandemic . Many countries were slow to figure out how best to respond to the crisis , while large swaths of their populations openly flouted social-distancing guidance . When the severity finally began to sink in , world leaders seized on terms such as battle plan , enemy , and frontline as a means of waking people up to the urgency of the situation and fostering a sense of solidarity . <p> But while wartime imagery can promote national cohesion , it can also breed fear , which can in turn drive anxiety and panic . The myriad changes being made to wage this " war " -- including enforced lockdowns , closures of schools and businesses , and the postponement of major events , such as elections -- and the looming prospect of a global recession have not only created uncertainty , but stripped many people of any sense of control . One of the most visible ways this fear has manifested has been in the increasing prevalence of empty supermarkets -- a by-product of what appeared to be a surge in panic-buying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks , and toilet paper scarce or , in some cases , prohibitively expensive . ( Other items , such as illicit drugs and firearms , experienced a similar increase in demand . ) In this case , evoking war did n't just alert people to the severity of the situation . For some of the most vulnerable members of society , including the elderly and health-care workers , it made the crisis much , much worse . <p> Another problem with using battle analogies is that they are n't particularly well suited for telling people what not to do . " War metaphors call for mobilization , for action , for doing something , " Veronika Koller , a linguist at Lancaster University in England , told me . In this pandemic , governments are asking people to do the opposite : to forgo normal routines and avoid going outside . Put simply , to do nothing . <p> War metaphors also tend to be , well , metaphorical . They lack precision and clarity , both of which are in desperately short supply right now . In Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ill-defined , Johnson 's announcement that the country would be put on a wartime footing did n't explain what that actually meant . " From a linguistic point of view , it 's still not clear , " Koller said in reference to the prime minister 's televised address last week announcing further restrictions as part of a nationwide lockdown . When it comes to what Britons should or should n't do , Koller added , " there are still lots of modifiers in there , like if possible and ideally or only if necessary . And that muddies the message . " <p> War is also , by its very nature , divisive -- which is not particularly helpful amid a crisis that requires global cooperation . These divisions have already begun playing out among people , most notably with the rise of xenophobia against East Asian communities and those perceived to be likely carriers of the virus . But they have started to appear at the diplomatic level too , in the form of a blame game between the U.S. and China over which country is responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable for explaining a pandemic , then what is ? When I put this question to Koller , she said there probably is n't just one correct framing or metaphor . Rather , " it 's about finding a balance between galvanizing people and making them aware that they have to take this seriously and ... not sending them into complete panic . " <p> Some leaders have already demonstrated ways of reframing the pandemic that are less likely to spur panic . In Denmark , Queen Margrethe II likened the virus to a " dangerous guest , " and urged Danes to " show our togetherness by keeping apart . " <p> Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , the director-general of the World Health Organization , invoked perhaps the one thing that is better than any war at rallying nations : sport . " You ca n't win a football game only by defending , " he wrote on Twitter . " You have to attack as well . " <p> We want to hear what you think about this article . Submit a letter to the editor or write to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Nothing about us without us ! ' <h> Meet Ezra Rifkin , advocate <p> Along , long time ago , before coronavirus took over the news , way back at the beginning of February , it was Jewish Disability Advocacy Day , and a local group from Jewish Federation of Greater MetroWest NJ headed down to Washington , D.C. , to lobby on Capitol Hill . <p> Arguably the star of the group was Ezra Rifkin , 20 , of Montclair , who was the first to address each of the legislators . <p> In an interview with NJJN , he said , " I am speaking up not just for others who need these laws to pass but also for myself . There are wonderful people advocating for disabled people every day , but it is powerful when the person with disabilities is the one asking . " <p> Ezra , a 2018 graduate of Montclair High School , never lets his autism get in the way of advocacy . <p> With his floppy dark curly hair , easy smile , and boy-next-door good looks , it 's easy to be charmed by him . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room table ( before Covid-19 social distancing guidelines were common ) , he preferred reading his responses to questions provided in advance than answering off the cuff , or that even a simple conversation takes time and some patience as he formulates his answers . These efforts pay off in seeing him share his passions : to make life more fair and more inclusive for those with disabilities , and to end gun violence . <p> Ezra Rifkin on Capitol Hill . Photos courtesy Ezra Rifkin <p> " My favorite slogan is ' Nothing about us without us , ' " he said . " People with disabilities should always have a voice and a seat at the table -- do n't make any decisions about them without them . We understand what we need and what is best for us . " <p> He has lobbied politicians in Trenton and Washington , overcoming fears and anxiety about speaking in public to do so . <p> Linda Scherzer , director of federation 's Community Relations Committee , called him a " tremendous addition " to the advocacy teams for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so passionate , " she said . " He brings integrity and eloquence to everything he says . " <p> On gun violence , an issue he first took up after the shooting in Newtown , Conn. , he said , " No one should feel afraid of being shot or killed in their church or synagogue , at a concert or supermarket or school . " <p> When the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Fla. , started a wave of gun control activism , he participated in the club that got started at Montclair High and served as one of the speakers at the school 's walkout . He joined a group of teen advocates from federation in Trenton , led by Scherzer , where they met with politicians to advocate for seven specific gun violence prevention bills and then stayed to watch the legislators cast their votes . All seven bills passed that day . <p> " My dream to act out against gun violence had finally come true , " Ezra said . " I got to go inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awesome . " <p> Later that year , the group traveled down to Washington . If the advocacy around stopping gun violence was trickier and perhaps met with less immediate success there , the impact on Ezra was no less profound . " Every time I speak up as an advocate it is practice for the next time I will speak , " he said . He was the only one of the teens with a disability , and the first of the group to sign up . <p> The February trip marked his second time participating in Jewish Disability Awareness Month ( JDAD ) ; he had joined the federation-led group of advocates that headed down to Washington for JDAD in 2019 . Once again Ezra was the only member of the group with a disability , and the only young person . " I know what it is like to be underestimated and I want to use my voice to speak up for all people with disabilities so that we can have equal civil rights , " he told NJJN . <p> Ezra Rifkin with Tom Harkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disability Advocacy Day . <p> In 2017 , he spoke out for the first time for JDAD at his own synagogue , Bnai Keshet , a Reconstructionist congregation in Montclair . He 's spoken there twice since , and this year , for the first time , at a second nearby synagogue , Temple Sholom of West Essex in Cedar Grove . He talks about his own experience , tries to relate his message to the weekly Torah portion , and reminds congregants that " people can and should engage with people with disabilities , hire them for jobs , talk to them , and get to know them . " <p> " Sometimes people are uncomfortable talking to people with disabilities ; they might look different or communicate differently , " Ezra said . " People need to move through their discomfort and get to know us , what we think and feel . " <p> For example , he said that it can be hard when people speak or teach in a way that does n't work for how he learns and understands things . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand how I communicate and learn , then I am able to participate in everything . " <p> He explains his motivation by quoting Hillel , who said , " If I am not for myself , who will be for me ? But if I am only for myself , what am I ? And if not now , when ? " <p> He acknowledged that " sometimes it feels very scary and stressful to speak in public . " Still , he pushes himself to overcome his nerves and his anxiety . " If I do not participate , then I have no genuine purpose , " he told NJJN . " As Jews , we are supposed to stand up for justice . " <p> Before the shutdown Ezra had been taking classes part time at Montclair State University .

@@31783641 <h> Is Iran on the brink of a coronavirus coup ? <p> If you do n't think that the coronavirus is a political issue , you must be self-quarantining under a rock somewhere . People everywhere are watching as their leaders respond to the pandemic . In free nations , their assessments will be delivered at the polls , where some careers will be applauded and others ended . But the credibility and durability of totalitarian states are at risk , too . Some analysts even think that Chinese leader Xi Jinping may be vulnerable to a coup . <p> Could the virus from Wuhan accomplish in a matter of months what seven U.S. presidents , 19 CIA directors , and legions of Iranian secularists and dissidents could only dream about achieving in Tehran ? The answer is maybe -- the coronavirus may just deliver the coup de grace to the theocratic dictatorship that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini started 41 years ago , but only if the devastation and feckless government response inspires everyone , from the lower classes to the ruling classes , to say " No more . " <p> Iran was hit by COVID-19 worse than many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its leaders . Its official infection rate and daily body counts are no more trustworthy than China 's . The Iranian people understand this , and increasingly they are blaming their leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . <p> When news of the virus first reached Iran , denial was the reflexive response . Seeking to prevent a massive boycott of the Feb. 21 parliamentary elections ( in which only pre-approved candidates vie for seats ) Khamenei said the threat was exaggerated , that " negative propaganda about the virus " was being used by Iran 's enemies to " dissuade Iranian voters . " <p> The most bizarre form of denial came as religious fanatics and sycophants seeking favor with the regime posted videos of themselves licking shrines at Shiite holy sites , daring the disease to infect them and expressing confidence that their faith would protect them . One said he came to Qom to show everyone that the virus " is nothing but stories . They want to take away our religion . They want to harm us . What they are doing is meaningless . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were confident that their leaders were telling them the truth and that their faith would save them probably were encouraged by the regime 's triumphalism . Iranian scientists such as Hossein Ali Shahriari , a member of the medical committee of the Iranian parliament ( majlis ) , boasted that medical experts from all over the world were coming to Iran not to offer help to the hapless but to learn from Iranian scientists . " In light of the measures we have taken in Iran , " he said , the outbreak " will certainly not last long . " He discounted advice from World Health Organization officials : " They certainly do n't have more expertise than the experts in Iran . " <p> And what expertise did Iranian scientists offer to the people ? Cleric Abbas Tabrizian gave this advice : " Before sleeping , put a cotton ball dipped in violet oil to the anus . " Presumably someone gave Khamenei better advice because on Feb. 15 his bodyguards prevented Iranians from kissing his hand . This should come back to haunt him . The opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bodies started to pile up and denial no longer was an option , Iran 's leaders turned to conspiracy theories . The regime 's perennial target of hate , Israel and " the Jews , " were blamed in a March 5 broadcast on Iran 's Press TV , an English-language disinformation outlet : " Zionist elements developed a deadlier strain of coronavirus against Iran . " <p> On March 10 , Gen. Gholamreza Jalali , head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ' ( IRGC ) Civil Defense Organization hinted that the coronavirus " has many characteristics of a biological weapon . ... The United States has many biological labs in the region surrounding Iran that may be responsible for the spread of the virus . " Another regime figure , Hossein Momeni , was more direct on March 10 when he pronounced it " without a doubt a man-made disease that has emerged as a weapon against the Shiites , against the Muslims , and against the Iranians . " <p> On March 22 , Khamenei himself spoke to the nation on live television and claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " experts " whose research shows that Israeli and American spies were using " demons " to spread the virus in Iran . <p> A decade or two ago , Khamenei might have ridden this disaster out comfortably , but recent riots in Iran suggest an awakening of the populace who see through the illusion of democracy in Iran . And the opposition is growing in number and influence . On March 29 , a group of 100 Iranian academics published a letter blaming Khamenei for the COVID-19 deaths in their country . The letter was released on a website that the Middle East Media Research Institute cites as being associated with Mir Hossein Mousavi , the 2009 Green Revolution leader still living a precarious existence under house arrest . <p> Their letter begins : " Mr. Khamenei , you are the No. 1 culprit in the COVID-19 pandemic becoming a national disaster ! " This opening salutation " Mr. Khamenei " ( instead of " Dear Supreme Leader " or even " Dear Ayatollah Khamenei " ) is a bold affront . The letter goes on to accuse Khamenei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It ends by bitterly noting the ironic " disgrace of a public afflicted with poverty and starvation in a country awash with petroleum . " These are fighting words . <p> There comes a time in every successful revolution when the military stops following orders from its illegitimate leaders and sides with the people . Even though Khamenei commands a police state skilled at terrorizing , the growing COVID-19 death toll in Iran could provide the tipping point for the military to stop following orders . <p> So what are the odds of a coronavirus coup in Iran ? I 'd give it 50-50 , especially if senior members of the regime die from the disease . That judgment , admittedly , is colored by my hope for regime change in Iran .

Snow has fallen onto relatively low levels in parts of the South Island cooling soils and reducing any future rain benefits . <p> Northland in the meantime is still dangerously dry . <p> With this as a backdrop it was both surprising and disappointing that we heard that while Silver Fern Farms had kept meat processing shifts working over much of the Easter break ; Alliance had decided to give its staff the break off . <p> Given that works are operating with reduced staff due to covid-19 spacing requirements I would have thought that the ability to keep shifts operating and provide workers with time off would have been possible . It sounded somewhat that management are out of touch with their farmer base .

This issue is affecting both meat and dairy farms alike . <p> Lamb took another hit this week on the schedules while beef is largely unchanged . Venison continues its consistent slide to depths not seen for many years ; that is , since 2015 and no sign of this trend being arrested .

At the moment there are still quite a few still operating within New Zealand providing some relief , however , their time will be limited . Including work visas , residence visas and student visas , last year there were approaching 400,000 temporary migrant workers available in New Zealand . Obviously not all of these worked within the primary industries , but a lot did . If/when New Zealand 's unemployment lifts to around 10% as has been tentatively estimated by Treasury under one of its more positive scenarios , this will leave about 250,000 people unemployed - bout an additional 140,000 on what we had in 2019 . This still leaves a 260,000 shortfall of temporary workers . <p> And let 's face it , on the evidence of the past , few of these additional unemployed are going to be looking for work on farms . <p> Some will , but not enough to make up for what has been lost . Horticulture and dairying are going to be the major sectors impacted upon but no doubt all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be affected . It is accepted that a single foreign worker does not necessarily equate to one domestic worker to replace them as often they are only working part -time or for only a portion of the year . So the match is a bit fuzzy but the short fall is obvious . <p> Perhaps the only minor piece of consolation is that many other developed nations are going to be experiencing similar situations . Germany , the USA and Australia have all expressed concern at some level of a lack of foreign workers able to assist in the work force . Until the world gets back onto its feet there does not appear to be a solution to this problem and the biggest loser are those foreign workers who rely upon these jobs to maintain both themselves and families back in their homelands . <p> The US congress has approved a $23.5 bln farm support package ( H/T Stevell ) as there is concern over there for both farmers and food production .

" <p> The EU ( and UK ) is reporting to be largely self sufficient in most of its staple foods , although it still manages to import huge volumes of more exotic foods .

@@31784541 <h> It 's time for the NHL to cancel the rest of the regular season <p> NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman continues to hold out hope that the league will be able to finish its regular season . John Minchillo/Associated Press <p> The NHL , still clinging to its hopes of finishing the season -- and still clinging to fans ' ticket money as long as it classifies games as postponed instead of canceled -- has prolonged its self-quarantine recommendation through April 30 . That means hockey wo n't return before mid-May if at all , perilously near the point when it would be wise to lock up the Zamboni until next season . <p> Maybe that time already has arrived . But there 's one reasonable option left before the ice is melted : Ditch the rest of the regular season . <p> Cancel the remaining games , about 15 percent of the schedule , so ticket-holding fans can get their money back to buy necessities . Cancel those games so teams that were eliminated do n't have to go through a farce of a training camp to play a dozen games just so Commissioner Gary Bettman can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play-in tournament for teams that were n't in playoff spots because it would devalue regular-season games that were played . Go right to the Stanley Cup playoffs if you must go at all , with qualifiers based on point percentage because teams had played a varying number of games when Bettman halted play March 12 because of the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> The latest extension of the league 's stay-at-home recommendation , announced Tuesday , was the third delay . In a one-paragraph statement , the league said that after consulting with medical experts and representatives of the NHL Players ' Association , it had " made the decision to extend the self-quarantine recommendation for NHL players , coaches and hockey staff through and including Thursday , April 30 . The self-quarantine had been in place through April 15 . " <p> The decision was n't a surprise , and it was n't definitive . It could n't be . There are still too many unknowns to set firm target dates for even a gradual return to something resembling normalcy . <p> Soon after the NHL had pushed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cloud over the notion of sports returning in the near future when he said it 's unlikely large events can resume this summer . " The prospect of mass gatherings is negligible at best until we get to herd immunity and get to a vaccine , " he said during a news conference . <p> President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he had appointed the commissioners of the major sports leagues as well as Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones , Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft to a committee that will guide the reopening of the country . That reopening , presumably , will be led by those leagues . " We have to get our sports back . I 'm tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old , " Trump said at his daily news briefing . <p> In the case of the NHL , which stands to miss out on about $1 billion in revenues if it ca n't resume , teams were asked to provide potential home dates into August . Why Bettman considers the season so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire 2004-05 season in a labor dispute . Ending in July would be late enough but might be possible with a condensed playoff format , maybe with the first two rounds as best-of-five series and the last two as best-of-seven . <p> Training camp for next season could be shortened and the 2020-21 opener delayed a few weeks . Eliminate bye weeks and gaps in the schedule , and a " normal " cycle could resume . <p> Speaking on Monday to CNN 's Anderson Cooper , Bettman acknowledged players would need two or three weeks of training camp before competition resumes . If individual states ' restrictions on gatherings are relaxed May 1 , that means the NHL could n't return before May 15 . There are Canadian guidelines to consider too , plus potential immigration issues for players who went overseas to wait this out . <p> " Until there 's a sense that people can get together , not just to fill our arenas but even our players to get together to work out , we do n't know when we can come back , " Bettman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prepared for every option , whenever the circumstances present themselves . So , we have n't ruled anything in , we have n't ruled anything out and we 'll be prepared to go in whatever direction makes sense at the time . " <p> Bettman acknowledged speculation the NHL has considered neutral sites such as Grand Forks , N.D. , home of the small but impressive Ralph Engelstad Arena . " The fact is , when you 're in the position that all of us are in , you have to be prepared to relaunch when the opportunity presents itself , which means you have to not rule out any conceivable alternative and be prepared on every one even if some of them ultimately turn out not to be realistic , " he said . <p> Grand Forks is unrealistic as a site for 16 teams in first-round play . It 's unfair to ask players to live in a bubble apart from their families , similar to a rumored option that would put every Major League Baseball team in Arizona . Staging games in NHL cities in empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it learned the NBA had shut down because of Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert 's positive COVID-19 test , remains a possibility , but that would be a hollow replacement for the real thing . <p> And so we wait , at least until April 30 and probably beyond . Ideally , NHL executives and their NHLPA counterparts will use this time to discuss ways to make the game better and continue keeping fans engaged when this is over . In the meantime , there are old games to watch . Many of them are pretty entertaining .

In the US , the Paycheck ... + Protection Program under the CARES Act seeks to mitigate the economic impact . <p> dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images <p> Updated on Apr. 15 to note FAQs issued by the US Treasury and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now at Goodwin Procter . <p> By now just about every small business is aware that the CARES Act , signed into law on March 27 , 2020 , has a provision called the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP ) . This $349 billion " loan " program provides financial assistance to small businesses ( up to 500 employees ) under financial stress because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown measures needed to fight the spread of the virus . An overview of the program is available in a summary from the US Treasury . <p> Offering funds covering up to eight weeks of payroll , the program 's purpose is to reduce the growth of unemployment , help small businesses retain employees , and enable them to rebound quickly after the pandemic is under control . The kicker is that the funds are , in the words of the US Treasury , " forgivable loans . " If your small business meets certain conditions , it will not have to repay the money . <p> The word on the street among small businesses is that these are basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own a small business " you 'd have to be crazy not to apply . " However , before you apply , beware the legal risks . There are potential pitfalls in what you need to certify to receive a " loan " under the program . <p> In its website section on the program , under Loan Details and Forgiveness , the US Small Business Administration ( SBA ) states : " The loan will be fully forgiven if the funds are used for payroll costs , interest on mortgages , rent , and utilities ( due to likely high subscription , at least 75% of the forgiven amount must have been used for payroll ) . Loan payments will also be deferred for six months . No collateral or personal guarantees are required . Neither the government nor lenders will charge small businesses any fees . Forgiveness is based on the employer maintaining or quickly rehiring employees and maintaining salary levels . Forgiveness will be reduced if full-time headcount declines , or if salaries and wages decrease . " <p> There is little legislative history on the CARES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a podcast interview with Florida Senator Marco Rubio , the chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship ( which developed the law ) . Rubio makes it clear that the government wants small businesses to apply and that they do not need to repay the loan in most situations . In fact , he sometimes calls it a " grant . " <p> I 've come across many credible non-government resources with details on the program , which could provide your business with a grant equal to 250% of your total average monthly payroll in the prior year ( up to $10 million ) . Sound commentaries on the program include blogs from Accounting Prose , The Wordstream Blog , small-business expert Barry Moltz , The Finance Buff , and Forbes.com blogger Kelly Phillips Erb , so look at those if you need more background . <p> The Certification In The Loan Application That Raises Questions <p> The loan application , while relatively easy to complete , does require you to initial certain certifications . For businesses that are still operating , the conditions to certify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to support the ongoing operations of the applicant . This certification and the others directly reflect provisions in the CARES Act ( see Section 1102 at the top of page 11 ) . <p> Frankly , I do n't know any small business that does not face significant uncertainty right now . Some are completely closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic . Others remain open with a reduced staff . In the months ahead , even businesses that manage to break even could lose contracts and deplete emergency funds . However , it seems obvious that the certification wording applies particularly to certain businesses directly impacted by the pandemic shutdown measures : for example , the struggling restaurants and many retail stores around my office ; on a personal level , the bowling alley my mother owns , my brother-in-law 's residential real estate agency , and my friend 's vacation travel consulting business . <p> For many small businesses that are not directly or indirectly forced to close , including my own ( largely focused on employee stock plan educational resources through the website myStockOptions.com ) , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard required for a forgivable loan by the PPP . Remember also that if the program is overwhelmed with requests from every small business , companies that are actually most at risk may get crowded out . <p> But the immediate question is this . Could the lure of " free money " for small businesses that do n't fully meet the PPP standards backfire and get them in trouble later ? <p> Major Law Firms Point Out Legal Risks <p> In a business-law alert , the law firm Quarles &amp; Brady explains the following ( in this and the followed quotations I have bolded part of the text for emphasis ) . " The PPP application requires the applicant to make a number of certifications , including : ' Current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the applicant . ' The SBA has not provided any definition or color about the nature or extent of the required impact to operations that would make the loan request ' necessary to support ongoing operations , ' which has both applicants and lenders skittish about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar client alert , the law firm Venable points out : " Borrowers must certify on the application that ' current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the Applicant . ' There is little guidance as to what exactly this means . " <p> In its commentary on the program , the law firm Ropes &amp; Gray goes so far as to warn about possible legal exposure under the False Claims Act ( FCA ) : " Already , news and opinion articles are addressing ( and Members of Congress are saying ) that there will be significant oversight over funds distributed through PPP . Private individuals have also made clear that they intend to exercise their rights under the Freedom of Information Act to identify the recipients of PPP loans with a view to identifying those who , in their view , were not the intended beneficiaries of the program . Applicants should be aware of possible negative public relations consequences of participating in the program ( even if clearly eligible ) , and that clients who take aggressive positions with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> In an article on the False Claims Act , Ropes &amp; Gray cautions that a misrepresentation included in an application for small business funding under the CARES Act may result in FCA liability . The firm advises applicants to take care to " avoid intentionally or recklessly running afoul of the eligibility criteria . " It concludes with a warning : " In sum , while the CARES Act provides important and valuable benefits to small businesses and the economy at large , businesses and their affiliates must pay increased attention to the CARES Act programs ' eligibility and certification requirements to avoid potential exposure to FCA liability , particularly in light of the rapidly evolving landscape . " <p> The SBA or US Treasury Department needs to provide more guidance , with an objective measure , on the conditions needed to meet this certification and others in the loan application . One idea for the Treasury is to wield the revenue-decline standard that appears in the CARES Act ( see Section 2301 pages 67 -- 68 ) . This allows certain employers affected by COVID-19 to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified wages ( including health benefits ) up to $10,000 per employee for wages paid after March 12 , 2020 , and before January 1 , 2021 . <p> Your business is eligible for this credit only if ( 1 ) the operation of that business is fully or partially suspended by the government due to COVID-19 , or ( 2 ) the business 's gross revenue is less than 50% of what it was the prior year 's calendar quarter , in which case the credit is available until the business recovers to earn at least 80% of the prior year 's revenue . It 's important to note that businesses which receive a loan under the new Paycheck Protection Program are not eligible for this payroll tax credit . <p> Update ( Apr. 15 , 2020 ) : The US Treasury and the US Small Business Administration ( SBA ) have published FAQs on the Paycheck Protection Program .

" These efforts have resulted in a 75% decrease in emissions over the past 30 years . " <p> St. James resident Barbara Washington also worries about the role air pollution could be playing in the rash of deaths her parish has seen . As of Thursday , 14 people in the parish had died from coronavirus , according to the state Department of Health . <p> " We know how many people have died in St. James Parish , " she said . " I know these people personally , so this is really hitting home for me . " <p> The role of air pollution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health published a study that found a small increase in tiny particles of air pollution , called particulate matter , is associated with a 15% increase in COVID-19 fatalities . The study added to a growing body of research indicating that longterm exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of the most severe coronavirus outcomes , including death , said Dr. Mary Prunicki , director of air pollution and health research at Stanford Medicine . <p> Particulate matter is a type of air pollution with varying levels of toxicity . Most particulate matter is the product of chemical reactions such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides , which are pollutants emitted from power plants , industries and automobiles . The Harvard study and others have focused on particles with diameters of 2.5 micrometers and smaller , about 1/30th the diameter of a human hair , known as PM 2.5 . <p> Fine particulate matter is generally more harmful than larger matter because it can reach more deeply into the lungs and enter into the bloodstream , Prunicki said . But air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 30 PM 2.5. monitors statewide , and many are not monitoring continuously . There are none in St. James or St. John parishes . <p> That creates a technical challenge in assessing the added risk that air pollution poses for specific communities , said Kimberly Terrell , director of community outreach at Tulane Environmental Law Clinic . But air modeling and satellite imagery can be used to estimate the levels of PM 2.5 in an area . <p> When those levels are overlaid with parish COVID-19 death rates , a pattern emerges , Terrell said . <p> " We see this cluster of deaths along the industrial corridor , " she said . " People who live in the industrial corridor are not more obese nor do they have more diabetes than the rest of Louisiana . So neither of these by themselves explains this geographic pattern of COVID deaths . " <p> The state Department of Health has released statistics showing that nearly all of the Louisianans who have died from coronavirus have at least one underlying health condition . Hypertension , obesity and diabetes are among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the country in dramatically reducing levels of PM 2.5 air pollution since 2000 . But around 2016 , PM 2.5 levels in the state started to show a slight increase . That uptick coincided with a recent boom in industrial facilities driven by low natural gas prices , Terrell said . <p> Ironically , the construction of new facilities could produce the clearest image yet of the air pollution known to increase coronavirus death rates . That 's because , in order to get air permits from the state , new and expanding facilities are required to conduct air modeling . <p> Although there is not a PM 2.5 air monitor in St. James Parish , air modeling submitted to the state Department of Environmental Quality by Formosa , which plans a plastic facility , indicates the parish has levels of fine particulate air pollution above an acceptable threshold set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , said Corinne Van Dalen , a staff attorney with Earthjustice . <p> This is especially troubling considering the EPA , which had been reviewing the question , announced Tuesday that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Dalen said . " These pollutants will stay in place , " she said . <p> A spokesperson for Formosa said the estimated levels of PM 2.5 in its application for a facility in in St. James Parish are based on the air pollution levels captured by a monitor nearby in Iberville Parish . Because that parish has a larger population and therefore more cars , it is likely the air pollution in Iberville Parish is higher than what it actually is in St. James Parish . The company 's projections indicate that the facility 's emissions would be within federal guidelines , according to the spokesperson . <p> While the company 's permit shows it will not cause PM 2.5 levels in St. James Parish to exceed annual limits set by the EPA , the projections also show that daily limits would be surpassed at times because of fluctuations of emissions .

They found an unadjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2.8% , a far higher level than official figures indicate . <p> " These prevalence estimates represent a range between 48,000 and 81,000 people infected in Santa Clara County by early April , " the study 's abstract reads , suggesting that the number of those infected with Covid-19 is " 50-85-fold more " than the number of confirmed cases in the region . <p> The tests are not a definitive proof by any means , and do not indicate immunity . However they lend weight to a growing suspicion that the virus is far more widespread than official numbers indicate . Former head of the FDA Scott Gotlieb ( here 's an excellent podcast interview with him on the Ezra Klein Show ) cited the story in saying " overall we 're probably diagnosing one in 10 to one in 20 infections " . <p> 1/2 This probably aligns with what overall national exposure may be , on order of about 5% once we do wide serology .

" The number of people on Jobseeker Support was 16% higher as at April 10 , compared to a month prior . As at April 10 , 5.6% of the working-age population was receiving Jobseeker Support , compared to 4.9% at the beginning of the year . " <p> This relatively small increase in unemployment compares favourably with the soaring numbers out of the US , which has seen an extraordinary 22 million file for benefits in the past four weeks , more than 10 times the previous record . By comparison , New Zealand government efforts to encourage employers to keep people in work have been largely successful , though the scheme is coming at an enormous cost . " MSD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.6 million people as at April 17 , " Tibshraeny writes . " Around 60% of people in employment are being supported by the subsidy .

The man , 38 , had been verbally warned on five separate occasions , according to Central District commander superintendent Chris de Wattignar . The sixth time he was discovered to have travelled some distance from his home led to his prosecution . <p> " Our first step has been to educate people on the rules , but if people continue to break them as in this case , police can use their discretion to warn people , or if necessary arrest them , " de Wattignar said .

" Now referred to as floating petri-dishes of disease , the attraction of taking a cruise ship in your golden years has hit lowest astronomical tide . " <p> The extension was originally budgeted at $16.9m , and meant to open in late 2020 ahead of the America 's Cup , which would have allowed the largest 320m-plus cruise ships to dock . With both the Cup and the cruise industry imperilled due to Covid-19 , the case for the wharf extension is far harder to make , says Darby . <h> 7.45am : Siouxsie Wiles and Toby Morris on contact tracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have done so much to elevate our understanding of important elements of the Covid-19 crisis return with a new collaboration covering contact tracing . It 's fascinating , and answers questions we 're likely to have all asked ourselves at times , especially as we head toward the end of the initial lockdown period , and approach Monday 's announcement . ( A reminder : all Toby and Siouxsie 's work is funded by The Spinoff Members . ) Here 's a sample : <h> How many people might still be incubating the virus ? <p> One of the deciding factors is likely to be how the number of actual daily cases is tracking compared to the modelling predictions . That will give them some idea of how many people could be expected to have the virus but not know it when we come out of lockdown . This number is important because of how cases can so easily grow exponentially . <p> Remember , people are infectious for a couple of days before they have symptoms and the first few days they are unwell . That means each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission that can grow exponentially . And because it can be two to 10 days before people start to show symptoms , it could take a few weeks before we start to realise those chains are happening . And then -- potentially -- we may have to go in to lockdown again to get them back under control . <h> 7.30am : School wo n't be voluntary after all <p> A rather large change to the initial level three announcements this morning , with the NZ Herald reporting the Principal 's Federation 's Perry Rush as saying he had been given a new communication from Iona Holsted , head of the Ministry of Education , essentially scrapping the voluntary designation for schooling . " I did have a clarification today that the term ' voluntary ' is muddying the waters . It 's not a voluntary return to school , " he said . " It 's ' If you need to be at school , you can ' . Voluntary implies want ; need is if you have to be there . That was unequivocally communicated by Iona . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information changed on key public sites , with first the MoE website and then , some hours later , the official Covid-19 website changing to reflect the new rules .

Physical education can not allow children closer than two metres . No balls , ropes or sticks . Special schools and after-school programmes remain closed . New rules for early childhood include more space per child and lifting the minimum temperature from 16C to 18C . <p> A fascinating story from the Washington Post this morning covers the halting re-emergence of Chinese hot pot chain Haidilao , which has just had to back down from a relatively small increase in prices , prompted by extra costs associated with protecting customers .

The two stories , one micro , the other macro , show just how complex post-lockdown life will be in the Covid-19 era . <p> That complexity and subtlety is not something US president Donald Trump seems overly concerned with . The growing trend of protestors in state capitols demanding the freedom to return to work , despite lockdown and a huge number of Covid-19 cases , has been boosted by a series of tweets through the night saying " liberate " followed by various states , culminating in one reading " LIBERATE VIRGINIA , and save your great 2nd Amendment . It is under siege ! " The tweets run against what was widely seen as a backdown of his earlier claim of the power to reopen the country should he wish .

Be mesmerised by KEEP YOUR DISTANCE ! ... @ <h> Breaking News Emails <p> LOS ANGELES - Crew members from Ellen DeGeneres ' long-running daytime talk show are distressed and outraged over their treatment from top producers amid the coronavirus pandemic , numerous insiders affiliated with the series told Variety . <p> The core stage crew for " The Ellen DeGeneres Show , " consisting of more than 30 employees , received no written communication about the status of their working hours , pay or inquiries about their mental and physical health from producers for over a month , said two sources , both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity . Higher-ups in production would occasionally answer phone calls but reveal little , added one of the sources . The crew was further incensed by the show 's recent hire of an outside , non-union tech company to help DeGeneres tape remotely from her home in California . <p> When production executives finally did weigh in , nearly all crew members were told last week to brace for a 60 percent reduction in pay , even as the show continues to air , according to sources close to the matter . <p> Only four core crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , added insiders , who find this treatment to be totally inconsistent with DeGeneres ' daily message to her audiences : " be kind . " <p> A spokesperson for Warner Bros . Television , which distributes the show , told Variety , " Our executive producers and Telepictures are committed to taking care of our staff and crew and have made decisions first and foremost with them in mind . " The studio reiterated the crew has been paid consistently , though at reduced hours . <p> For more than two weeks , from late March through April 9 , crew members -- from lighting to camera operators to grips -- were left in the dark about if and how much they would be paid . Phone calls to crew members from a production coordinator at Telepictures , the Warner Bros. unit that produces " Ellen , " were sporadic and often lacking any information before and after the 14-day blackout . <p> The lack of transparency continued as DeGeneres expanded her output from hosting four shows a week to five , shot over two days , said individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created anxiety among crew members who feared they would be furloughed and , in that case , would need to explore unemployment benefits . <p> A Warner Bros. spokesperson acknowledged that communication could have been better , but cited complications due to the chaos caused by COVID-19 . <p> On April 2 , the majority of the crew members were shocked to discover that DeGeneres had a remote set erected at her residence where she was taping , a fact they learned via social media posts from colleagues in other departments , insiders said . <p> Under normal circumstances , " Ellen " tapes four days a week . Studio episodes of the show were last shot the week of March 9 . The crew was last paid in full for the week of March 16 , when the Warner Bros. lot was shut down as a precaution to prevent the spread of coronavirus , according to the studio . The following week of March 23 was a planned spring break hiatus . <p> " When returning from break , the crew was paid the week of March 30th despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spokesperson said . Pay reduced to 8 hours from 10 hours per work day for the week of the 30th , insiders said . <p> As of April 10 , crew was told to expect a reduced compensation of two , 8-hour work days per week . In the hours following Variety 's Wednesday request for comment on the reduced pay and lack of communication , word began circulating among crew that they would be restored to their full four-day work weeks . An individual close to Warner Bros. disputed that timeline , saying the crew is paid in arrears and the final hour count had not yet been finalized . <p> Adding insult to injury , sources said that while most of the crew was left out of work with reduced pay , the remote production has hired Key Code Media , a Burbank-based audiovisual house , to help produce technical elements of the show while crew members with the same skills sit idle . Each of DeGeneres ' crew is affiliated with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees union . <p> One local IATSE rep spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week of April 7 , sources said , and reported back that their understanding was that union members would continue to be paid . The union rep advised the crew to " watch closely , " one person familiar with the exchange said . An IATSE spokesperson did not immediately comment on the matter . The studio said the third-party hire was cleared with union reps . <p> " Due to social distancing requirements , technical changes in the way the show is produced had to be made to comply with city ordinances and public health protocols , " said a WB spokesperson , adding that no crew member lost a job in the hiring of Key Code . <p> On her April 7 return to the air , DeGeneres told viewers she " wanted to start doing my new show as soon as possible .

So , on the one hand , it 's understandable that countries are taking different approaches but , on the other hand , it 's a huge experiment and we 're all watching different countries to see who 's figuring it out and who is making big mistakes . " <h> So which country has the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they began testing very quickly and extensively , so we like Iceland because they have been very effective , " said Professor O'Neill . <p> " Germany has done a fantastic job as well , they got in very early with testing , those are the two countries that really stand out at doing a great job . ( ... ) <p> " But , in truth , it 's a mixed picture , some countries are n't doing enough and there have been problems with getting enough test kits in ( ... ) so it has been a challenge for some countries . " <h> Can people be infected more than once ? <p> " The answer is we do n't fully know but there is good evidence that you 're probably protected if you 've been infected , " said Professor O'Neill . <p> " For example , there was an experiment done with monkeys which they infected with the virus and then tried to re-infect them and they could n't . Secondly , we know we make a big antibody response to this virus , loads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real virus-busters by the way and if you carry those antibodies then it means you had the virus and are no longer infectious . <p> " There is good evidence that you should be protected , the question is how long will that protection last and people who work on other coronaviruses say about a year maybe which is good . " <h> What 's the best medication to fight COVID-19 ? What about hydroxychloroquine ? <p> " Hydroxychloroquine is interesting because it has shown to have effects against the virus ( ... ) but we 've got to be very , very careful though because there is no doubt it damages the heart in a small number of patients , " said Professor O'Neill . <p> " The problem is COVID-19 is heart-damaging as well . So the worry we have there is this is a double-whammy if you give this medication to someone and they 've already got heart problems , there is a risk it might make it worse . The trials are progressing very , very carefully and there is still no compelling evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials and then we 'll know . I would urge caution with this drug until those trials are done . ( ... ) In the next three or four weeks , that 's the key window now , for some of these medicines the results will begin to emerge and we 're all keeping our fingers firmly crossed . " <p> " There are concerns about safety on a couple of levels , some patients have very toxic reactions to hydroxychloroquine or other drugs so we have to be quite cautious , " Dr Moon said . <p> " It 's normal that there is a lot of panic during a pandemic with a new virus . Doctors and nurses are faced with very difficult decisions every day . So it 's understandable that we 're throwing the medicine chest at patients in some ways but we really have to be very cautious and let the trials answer the questions in a definitive way . " <h> How do we make sure people have access to the drugs once an effective one is found ? <p> " We 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions and countries that have the capacity to manufacture the medicines will most likely make sure their own people are served first , " said Dr Moon . <p> " We have a huge concentration globally in the way that medicines are manufactured , only a handful of countries have large-scale manufacturing . So the question of how we make sure that effective drugs reach everybody who needs them in all countries without bankrupting health systems is a huge issue , we have not made enough progress in addressing it . " <h> What about a vaccine , when is that going to happen ? <p> " It 's not realistic to say we are going to have any vaccine approved until next year , " said Dr Moon . " People estimate at least 12 to 18 months to have regulatory approval of that vaccine which is not the same thing as saying it 's been manufactured and is available around the world . <p> " This is really unprecedented , I have to emphasise that we have never before had a pandemic that has spread so quickly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the vaccines at the same time . <p> " I am more worried about medicines because we are going to see the results of the trials are going to come out in the next few weeks and the scramble for drugs is going to be instant . We do n't have the measures in place either to ramp up production , get over export bans or make sure that some of the developing and poor countries have the money to compete as buyers with some of the richer countries . We are going to see countries really being left behind in the scramble for drugs . " <h> This disease does not just cause respiratory symptoms , what are the other effects possible ? <p> " It 's a nasty virus , " said Professor O'Neill . " The receptor for the virus called ACE 2 , that 's the thing the virus locks on to with its spikes , to get inside cells , that is in your lungs , in your gut , it 's in your heart and it may even be in your brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die of respiratory failure . The others are more symptomatic , although there may be a cause of death in these tissues as well , but , the main cause of death is the lung problem . " <h> What should I take if I have mild symptoms ? <p> " There is no cure , there is nothing obvious , " said Professor O'Neill . " You take paracetamol for your temperature because fever is a key feature . Paracetamol is a very safe drug that works very well to bring down the fever and it can help with some of the aches and pains , the typical flu-like symptoms . Stay very well hydrated , drink lots of water . Your immune system uses a lot of water to keep it going . And you have to look after your immune system , That means trying to get a good night 's sleep , try and exercise and have a good diet and try and de-stress because that really damages our immune response . " <h> What is the deal with masks ? Does it protect you against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing masks is to protect everybody else , " said Dr Moon . " If you are sick and of course many of us do n't know if we 're carrying the coronavirus , but whatever the case , if you 're wearing a mask you will minimise the amount of virus you are putting into the atmosphere . <p> " There is a hypothesis that Asian countries where it is more customary to wear a mask , the fact that many are wearing masks has helped get this epidemic under control . <p> " But a lot of countries are really experimenting while watching others very closely to see what seems to be making a difference and what does n't . <p> " There is a major concern that if many people go out to buy masks , there will be a shortage in hospitals and there is another concern that if you do n't know how to use a mask and you touch it and touch your face , you may increase the risk .

This applies for everything we do and we see examples of this in the lock down for Covid 19 these people are telling us what is essential and what is not . <p> The problem is that they make mistakes because these bureaucrats can only rely on their personal experience and often this is moulded by a life time removed from reality , being employed in the public service which was evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead at the Pike River Mine . <p> This is not to say that they are not realistic in their views it is just that they are , by their employment in public service , often unaware of the realities of life particularly in the lower socio-economic brackets of society . <p> I believe that if we simplified a lot of the legislation that we have to work under then a lot more would get done and you would build a resilient work force that would be able to make their social/work life balances work ? <p> In the current economic climate post the lockdown we are going to have a serious number of people in financial difficulties with initially , much higher levels of unemployment and the need for financial assistance from government . <p> It 's time the MP 's and bureaucrats who run the government and Councillors/local bodies realise that they should be putting in a balanced budget or a reduction in the rate takes and look at just doing the minimum works that they need to do to allow society to function . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levy payers whether they want a 2.5% or 3.5% rate rise when given the current economic climate ACC should bite the bullet and declare a zero increase for at least the next twelve months . Local bodies should stand up and say we will reduce the rates so people have monies left to feed their families instead of having charities distributing food parcels so that people do not starve . <p> A recently published Bloomberg article written by : John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge stated the following : - <p> The most misleading cliche about the coronavirus is that it treats us all the same . It does n't , neither medically , economically , socially or psychologically . In particular , Covid-19 exacerbates preexisting conditions of inequality wherever it arrives . Before long , this will cause social turmoil , up to and including uprisings and revolutions . <p> Social unrest had already been increasing around the world before SARS-CoV-2 began its journey . According to one count , there have been about 100 large anti-government protests since 2017 , from the gilets jaunes riots in a rich country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Sudan and Bolivia . About 20 of these uprisings toppled leaders , while several were suppressed by brutal crackdowns and many others went back to simmering until the next outbreak . <p> The immediate effect of Covid-19 is to dampen most forms of unrest , as both democratic and authoritarian governments force their populations into lockdowns , which keep people from taking to the streets or gathering in groups . But behind the doors of quarantined households , in the lengthening lines of soup kitchens , in prisons and slums and refugee camps -- wherever people were hungry , sick and worried even before the outbreak -- tragedy and trauma are building up . One way or another , these pressures will erupt . <p> 1651 , a gentleman scholar who readily admitted that " fear and I were born twins " published one of the great books on government . Thomas Hobbes had survived the notoriously bloody English Civil War by fleeing to France -- and his great philosophical concern was personal safety . Life in a state of nature was , he observed , " solitary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always fighting . So , he argued , citizens should contractually give up their freedoms to a ruler who could offer them protection . The state 's legitimacy depended on it fulfilling that contract and keeping its citizens safe , a revolutionary idea at a time when kings , like his former pupil Charles II , claimed their position came by divine right . For Hobbes , who also managed to survive the Great Plague in 1665-66 and died in his bed at 91 , our contract with " Leviathan , " as he called his book , depended on its ability to keep us safe . <p> If Hobbes were alive today , he would feel vindicated . Around the world , fear is on the march -- and , in order to be protected from this terrible virus , we are willingly surrendering basic rights , even the freedom to leave our own homes , to Leviathan . The Covid-19 pandemic has made government important again . Not just powerful again ( look at those once-mighty companies begging for help ) , but also vital again : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , competent bureaucrats and sound finances . Good government is the difference between living and dying . <p> Since Hobbes 's time , the world has come full circle . When he wrote " Leviathan , " China rather than Europe was the center of administrative excellence . China was the world 's most powerful country with the world 's biggest city ( Beijing had more than a million inhabitants ) , the world 's mightiest navy and the world 's most sophisticated civil service , peopled by scholar-mandarins who were selected from across a vast empire by rigorous examinations . <p> Europe was a bloodstained battlefield ruled by rival feudal families , where government jobs were either allotted by birth or bought and sold like furniture . Gradually Europe 's new nation states overtook the Middle Kingdom because they underwent a series of revolutions unleashed by national rivalries and political ideas -- not least those advanced by Hobbes . By mastering the art of government ( even copying China 's " mandarins " ) the West dominated the world for 400 years . <p> The West 's governmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would feel safer today in New York and London or in Singapore and Seoul ? Asia is catching up with the West , and in some smaller countries has overtaken it , in large part because Confucian Asia in particular has taken government seriously over the past few decades while the West has allowed it to ossify . <p> The public sector in the West is decades behind its private sector in terms of efficiency and dynamism . Lenin once said that " there are decades where nothing happens , and there are weeks where decades happen . " The coronavirus crisis is exactly such a history-accelerating event . If Western governments respond creatively to the crisis , they will have a chance of reversing decades of decline ; if they dither and delay while Asia continues to improve ; the prospect of a new Eastern-dominated world order will surely increase . <p> Will the Covid-19 crisis be the spur for governments to improve ? <p> At first glance , the omens are not good . Everywhere you look , you see bureaucracy 's in a sorry state -- overstretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But if we look more closely there are more positive signs . Countries that have rethought government , like Denmark , or valued good government traditions , like Germany , are doing better at dealing with the virus . <p> If you look back through history , Western government has been through at least three big revolutions , driven in each case by new ideas , new technology and new threats . <p> The first which occurred around the time of Hobbes was the creation of the competitive nation states . <p> The second revolution occurred in the late 18th and early 19th centuries . Thinkers such as Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill in Britain and Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in America argued that corrupt monarchical privilege should give way to liberal efficiency . New technologies such as the railway and later the telegram allowed the state to do more with less . British liberals ruthlessly got rid of sinecures , sacking incompetents , opening the civil service to merit . Victorians believed that it was perfectly possible to make government more useful and smaller at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . <p> The third revolution began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries -- and laid the foundations for the welfare states that all of us in the West now inhabit . The watchword was security once again , but this time it was security against maladies , misfortunes and inequalities , rather than civil war and the plague . As late as the 1960s , many people in the West still believed that government could secure ever more benefits . But after the debacle of Vietnam and the disaster of the energy crisis , faith in government began to pall . <p> Policy makers began to turn to libertarian thinkers , like F.A . Hayek and Milton Friedman , who trusted the market rather than enlightened bureaucrats to fix things , and who had long argued that people were handing over too many freedoms for only marginal gains in well-being . <p> Nowadays , the state consumes about 40% of gross domestic product in the West , compared with 10% at the beginning of the 20th century . <p> The Western state is a grumpy , unloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets too much ; the people who use its services think it gives them too little . The more things the state promises to do , the more it overburdens itself ; the more it overburdens itself , the more we all complain . <p> When it regulates something , we complain ; when it stands pat and allows something to go wrong , we complain louder and the gulf between it and the more dynamic private sector yawns ever wider . <p> Behind the ideological squabbling , the main problem with Western governments is simple : They are out of date . If you want a symbol of this , look no further than of all the changes that the private sector has been through over the past century : vertical integration followed by contracting out ; steep hierarchies followed by delayering ; skyscraper headquarters followed by suburban campuses followed by a return to the city . <p> Think of all the companies that have been created and destroyed in a never-ending whirlwind of creative destruction . Now think of governments that have continually expanded even when the private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western government has atrophied , Asia has embraced the future . Singapore has been a leader . A city-state that was once an impoverished swamp which can now claim to be the best-governed small state in the world . <p> Singapore has achieved this not by spending large sums of money -- it spends less than 20% of GDP on government -- but by thinking more creatively and acting more decisively . Singapore also works creatively with the private sector . The government manoeuvres local businesses up the " value chain " -- betting first on manufacturing then on services and now on the knowledge economy , particularly information technology and pharmaceuticals . <p> The relative performance of Asia and the West in coping with coronavirus should be a warning to the West . Many of the most impressive government responses have been in East and Southeast Asia . While the West dawdled , Japan , Hong Kong , South Korea and Singapore all developed their own tests for Covid-19 , ramped up production of the materials needed for the tests and made money available so that people could pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booths in the streets in Seoul where you can get walk-by tests from masked health-care workers sitting behind protective glass . The fact that , having done everything right , Singapore was eventually forced to introduce a lockdown , or " circuit-breaker " as it calls it , on April 7 is testimony to the virulence of the virus . Fewer than 10 people have died there . <p> No one would describe the virus response as being a success for Western soft power . A few European countries have performed creditably . Germany , where trust in government runs at the same high levels that we see in South Korea and Singapore , has been successful at mass-producing tests and using them to slow the death rate . By the end of March , the country had tested a million people : In Bavaria , 11,000 of the 13,000 tests it does every day are in private labs . <p> So what should we learn from this ? One theory being spoken is that government needs to be expanded permanently to deal with global crises . The argument being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state in the past , so the war against Covid 19 will greatly expand it from now on . Government-supported health systems will expand to deal with future threats . Governments will be stuck running big chunks of the economy . <p> This argument is unconvincing . The current list of government-expanding measures look pragmatic and temporary : a combination of Keynesian demand-management to boost the economy , time-limited intervention to prevent vulnerable industries from collapsing and a basic income for workers who are temporarily laid off . Rather than clear the way for an era of ambitious government programs , the crisis could well usher in yet another era of austerity , especially as already indebted governments try to bring their debt under control . <p> In relation to the New Zealand government 's response to the crisis I believe that the recent statement on facebook from the Hamilton East MP Hon David Bennett <p> ( " Many years ago our forebears had the foresight to use large Gov't funding and an able workforce to build projects that deliver to the Waikato 's region in 50 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding are n't for short term nice to haves but deliver a long term and substantial changes that provide for a stronger economic base for the region for generations to come " . ) <p> could be a guiding principle for government in their decisions about which infrastructure projects they are going to support in kick starting our economy post the Covid 19 lockdown , with the only change to that statement being a focus nationally rather than just on the Waikato region . <p> The most interesting lesson we should take from crisis concerns two things that are seldom discussed together : the efficiency of the government apparatus and the purpose of government in general . <p> One thing that links governments that have reacted well to the crisis is a taste for learning from one another , and from the past . <p> The single greatest failure in the West 's public sector has been its failure to copy success . <p> In the private sector " best practice " spreads rapidly because companies that learn from the best survive and those that refuse go under . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jobs-for-life and risk aversion , institutions get stuck in their ways . <p> The pandemic may well finally spark a burst of modernization . Governments will be squeezed by two contradictory pressures . <p> The first is the pressure to improve many of their welfare provisions , most particularly their health-care and social care systems , so they can cope with any subsequent outbreaks . The other is to balance their books as public debt surges to unsustainable levels . <p> Indeed , this crisis should prompt all the democracies of the West to ask some hard questions . Should governments offer state employees jobs for life ? <p> The West needs to tackle the great question that most countries have avoided since the 1980s : What is the state for ? <p> The Covid 19 crisis has been a powerful reminder that the basic function of the state is the one that Hobbes defined : to offer its citizens protection . <p> In this case it means providing some kind of public health-care and welfare systems . The phrase " herd immunity " may be an ugly one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health is concerned : During a pandemic , the health of even the most privileged is dependent on the health of the least privileged . The fight against a virus is necessarily collective . <p> There is no doubt that the West faces as big a crisis as it has since the Second World War from the damage that is being inflicted by Covid-19 . The great geopolitical question facing the world is whether the West can rise to the challenge as it has so many times before and rethink the theory and practice of government .

On Wednesday , the union plans to deliver 1,600 petitions to Gov . Pete Ricketts . <p> She wants to be the giver of information , not the recipient of attention .

" <p> Recovery will be " a team effort , " the governor said during his daily news briefing on the coronavirus and the state 's efforts to manage the pandemic . <p> New state government revenue figures demonstrate that " the Nebraska economy was really humming along " until the virus hit , Ricketts said . <p> As the calendar moves into the final two weeks of April , when the virus is expected to peak in the state , the governor is looking ahead to the beginning of recovery without making any decisions yet on when he will lift social or physical distancing restrictions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ricketts said he expects to open up " incrementally , a little bit at a time " without removing all restrictions at once . <p> A study by Kaiser Health News resulted in this headline in the Daily Beast that stirred internet traffic : " Nebraska getting $300G in federal money for each coronavirus case while NY gets $12G .

" <p> Ricketts pointed to the assessment that Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , made that Nebraska 's policy of shutting down schools , limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people , encouraging people to work from home and implementing physical distancing standards is " functionally equivalent " to shelter-at-home orders in most other states . <p> While the restrictions appear to be working , Ricketts said , " we need to do more testing " to identify people who may be infected by the virus and , in turn , test the people who have been in contact with them in order to control and prevent its spread . <p> Acquiring testing materials , primarily reagents , has been a challenge , the governor said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels " and I feel like we 're making progress . " <p> So far , Ricketts said , the state is meeting its goal of " not overwhelming the health care system . " <p> The governor said current modeling suggests Nebraska will not experience its coronavirus peak until late April or early May and he 'd " certainly encourage " Nebraskans to consider wearing masks to help slow the spread . <p> University of Nebraska President Ted Carter said the university is ready to do its part in helping " bring our economy back , " working in large part through its research activities . <p> The university is a key partner in the business recovery research project announced by the governor . <p> Bryan Slone , president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry , said the hardest-hit businesses in the state are Main Street businesses such as restaurants , as well as retail stores . <p> Slone suggested Nebraskans join gift card campaigns that are now underway to help support local businesses . <p> Stephanie Beasley , director of the Division of Children and Family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , announced the state will launch two initiatives to assist families receiving child care subsidies during this period of economic stress . <p> One would provide for subsidized child care at home and the other would help sustain child care providers with financial support even if the child who is normally subsidized is not there . <p> Ricketts announced that 18,565 Nebraska businesses have applied for $2.7 billion in federal loans that are available under the economic stimulus package recently approved by Congress . Those forgivable loans are designed to keep people employed . <p> Rounding out the briefing , Carter was asked whether he expected Nebraska to be able to play football this fall . <p> " I 'm looking forward to football back in Memorial Stadium with some number of fans there , " he said .

@@31792941 <h> Who will pay the big lockdown bill ? <p> The government 's extraordinary measures to halt Covid-19 and support the economy have had extraordinary public support . Tony Burton argues that the hard choices about who pays for it will be far less popular . <p> I have lived with a skeleton since the lockdown . It 's white and shiny and takes up half the space in my living area . No one died , though it is a bit creepy at times . The skeleton is the empty frame of a half-built kitchen left behind when the work stopped at the lockdown . For my household bubble , it has been a nuisance having the fridge in the bathroom and having to cook on a barbecue . However , Treasury modelling released on Tuesday suggests this is a mild inconvenience compared to the economic trauma all of us will face over the next few years . <p> Jacinda Ardern showed an understanding of both epidemiological maths and public sentiment when she decided our Covid-19 response should include a lockdown . Close to 90% of New Zealanders support her , yet the choices she must make as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have anything like that unanimity of support . They will ultimately decide which generations bear the brunt of paying for the extraordinary stimulus . <p> Professor Neil Ferguson , whose study in the UK is the basis of the scary epidemiological maths , has suggested that " as many as half to two thirds " of those who die with coronavirus would have died by the end of this year regardless of whether or not they caught the disease because most fatalities are among people at the end of their lives or suffering from underlying health conditions . Some healthy people die , as they do every year from the flu , but the main beneficiaries of the lockdown are physically vulnerable people who are no longer working . <p> New Zealand 's approach prioritised the lives of the vulnerable over the economy . To do this , most people in work have indefinite leave and an advance on future wages . So far , $12bn has been committed for these advances , mostly spent on subsidies equivalent to 80% or more wages . When finance minister Grant Robertson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world on a per capita basis " , it was not political hyperbole . In December 2019 , as part of a normal budget process , he set aside $3bn for extra non-capital expenditure ( " operating allowances " ) . Most of that would have been spent on increases to public sector pay and other maintenance of the system , so $12bn on a new initiative is a colossal spend . <p> The Treasury report released on Tuesday provides an economic background to help " weigh up the implications of fiscal and regulatory policy decisions " . It is presented with 2019 as the baseline followed by the current year and four " out years " . In the graphs below , GDP ( incomes ) is in the left-hand graph and unemployment rate on the right . In both , the solid blue line is the projection without Covid-19 . The black lines show what happens with increasingly severe lockdown conditions ( see here for a full summary . ) <p> The wooden skeleton in my house gives a more human sense of the economic dislocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not see work immediately restart on our kitchen . Even a return to level one would mean a week or more of organising plumbers , joiners , painters and polishers . The planner estimates a further six weeks before the backlog of work is cleared . That is the best-case scenario , with children back in school , contractors working without distancing restrictions , and imported items ( like floor polish ) all available . More likely , we will be living with that skeleton for months . A single household kitchen , already planned and budgeted for , is considerably simpler than many economic activities . It is easy to see why the delays and dislocation created by the lockdown mean it will be well into next year before incomes and employment start to recover . <p> Macroeconomic modelling for government is as much a team activity as rugby . The Treasury analysts must have worked under extraordinary difficulties to produce this report in a lockdown . However , for a paper on " fiscal and regulatory policy decisions " , it is strangely quiet about both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it policy-relevant . For instance , they could have estimated debt to GDP ratio and the cost pressure created by servicing more debt . <p> A clue to why these results are in their format : this is how they are normally shown in budget documents . They would have been fed into longer-term fiscal models to put numerical estimates on hard choices about debt , spending levels , and the tax rates needed to make them sustainable . The suspicion must be this paper was created to " manage the authorising environment " . That is , to present scenarios with no policy content to soften up the public for the unpalatable choices that need to be signalled in the 2020 budget . <p> What could these policy choices look like ? There are at least two issues that urgently need to be addressed . There certainly wo n't be 90% support for any of these policy options . <p> Most obvious is how to deal with the cost of the wage advances . In the short term , when faced with a worldwide economic calamity , increasing debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September ( but well within the time covered by budget forecasts ) , a decision needs to be made on what overall debt level we will target and if the extra costs associated with that debt are to be covered by reducing other spending or increasing taxes . <p> These are the kind of extraordinary times when the government might consider extraordinary responses . Will they recognise the main beneficiaries of the lockdown are over-65s and revisit a capital gains tax or consider a surcharge on New Zealand Superannuation ? Both would more evenly distribute the financial costs among generations . Given New Zealand First is in the coalition , and will be implacably opposed to anything touching superannuation , the government is more likely to look at higher taxes for middle and upper-income earners ( $48,000 to $70,000 per year and more than $70,000 per year respectively ) . <p> The other big economic issue is a potential crunch in the labour market . The optimistic Treasury scenario has the unemployment rate tripling this year and staying high for years after that . Getting people back into work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a structural shift in the labour market pushing up employment costs . Partly this is an unavoidable consequence of closing borders . Travel bans and quarantine regulations will make skilled migrants think twice about coming here and dissuade many seasonal workers in the agricultural and service sectors . <p> More important in the longer term will be the incentive impact of increasing 2020 benefit rates in line with 2019 wage rises . This is hitting at the same time wages will be falling for two years . The normal response -- in-work payments to improve incentives -- are expensive ( think of the billions spent on Working for Families ) and further add to the hard fiscal choices . If we do not deal with the problem then higher unemployment will become the new normal . <p> Higher taxes and benefit incentives are scary for politicians , far scarier than any skeleton . The next stage of the policy to deal with Covid-19 is going to be very unpopular . <p> Long after a vaccine has been distributed we will likely still be arguing over who bears the financial costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made possible thanks to the support of Kiwi Wealth .

@@31793141 <h> Governments likely to defer to Big Tech on Covid-19 contact tracing <p> From the UK 's NHS to the City of Berkeley , governments and health authorities around the world are preparing to launch Bluetooth apps for contact tracing during the Covid-19 pandemic . With such apps , infected users could anonymously alert everyone they previously came in contact with while they were at risk of transmitting the virus . But lingering questions remain about the privacy and efficacy of such smartphone-based contact tracing . <p> Google and Apple are teaming up to unveil an API for digital contact tracing in May , but are restricting its use to public health authorities and governments . Such apps will be based on open-source protocols designed by leading academic institutions , such as MIT 's Safe Paths , and Covid Watch , a collaboration by Stanford University and the University of Waterloo . <p> But the world 's two largest mobile platform operators have also put strict limits on how health agencies can access the data themselves . <p> NHS , which is working on a contact-tracing app , is currently sparring with Google and Apple over such limits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on population flows in the aggregate , and other detailed features to track the spread of the virus . But Google and Apple , in the interest of protecting privacy , wo n't allow it . <p> Rhys Fenwick , a spokesperson for Covid Watch , told Quartz that the group recently began advising the NHS on building its app . Covid Watch has expressed support for the decentralized approach favored by Google and Apple , which prevents governments from storing information collected from a user 's phone in one centralized location . The tech giants argued in a press call this week that such restrictions would keep governments from using contact tracing for mass surveillance . Singapore 's TraceTogether app , while it uses person-to-person Bluetooth detection , stores data in a centralized server , which some say made it more vulnerable to hacking and misuse . <p> Google and Apple have made some adjustments that will allow digital contact tracing apps to run more smoothly . Normally , apps that use Bluetooth ca n't operate in the background , unless it 's streaming audio or you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions for digital contact tracing . <p> Fenwick said there was disagreement , even among proponents of digital contact tracing , over how the technology should be used and in what fashion . " The specific tradeoff between privacy and research utility is , evidently , one on which there is disagreement . Covid Watch leans heavily to the side of privacy ; we are willing to sacrifice social network data if that is the only reliable way of ensuring anonymity , as it seems to be . There is a diversity of opinions on this matter ; we are confident that NHS England will arrive at a sensible result that respects and preserves the privacy of its users , " Fenwick wrote in an email to Quartz . <p> There 's also doubt over how effective digital contact tracing will be in regions with a particularly high number of cases , such as New York City , or countries where there is limited access to testing . In those situations , apps will be unable to account for the number of asymptomatic people who carry the virus . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the many essential workers who come into contact with strangers on a daily basis , such as a delivery driver or grocery store workers . It could also be effective as regions gradually lift their lockdown measures and transition back to normal life . <p> " Such an app might be helpful with contact tracing in a time we hope is coming soon , when community transmission is low enough that the population can stop sheltering in place , and when there is sufficient testing to quickly and efficiently diagnose COVID-19 at scale , " wrote the Electronic Frontier Foundation in a statement on its website . While civil liberties groups like the EFF and ACLU favor a decentralized approach , both groups stressed that all digital contact tracing still needed strong privacy safeguards . <p> Meanwhile , there is disagreement in Europe over whether its approach will be decentralized or centralized . France and Germany have both started building apps that rely on central servers , coming into conflict with Google and Apple 's plans . Both nations are members of PEPP-PT -- Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact tracing apps in the EU . <p> Christopher Boos of PEPP-PT told the New York Times that the group 's platform will work in either a centralized or decentralized setting . But they may not have a choice . The European Union Commission issued guidelines for contact tracing on Friday ( April 17 ) that backed a decentralized approach that followed GDPR , EU 's data privacy law . Several nations including Austria , France , Germany , Italy , and Spain have agreed to develop country-specific apps that follow the PEPP-PT model . PEPP-PT contact tracing apps will be interoperable , meaning they will work when travel restrictions are lifted in Europe . The coalition has also agreed that its apps will be mutually interoperable with the NHSX app in the UK . <p> Proponents of Bluetooth apps say they 'll do a better job of preserving privacy and keeping identities anonymous than apps that use GPS and location tracking . But critics of digital contact tracing remain dubious . Even Apple and Google admitted in a press call earlier this week that no technology is " unhackable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think that cellphone tracking will help curb the virus , according to Pew Research survey results released this week . But in the coming months , billions will be able to do so without even downloading an app , as Google and Apple roll out contact tracing in their operating systems . <p> Correction : An earlier version of this article inaccurately stated that the EU Commission backs a centralized approach . Their guidelines are in favor of a decentralized approach . Updated with further comment from PEPP-PT.
@@31793341 <p> President Trump is not happy with the World Health Organization . He is not the only one . <p> On Tuesday , in the middle of a global pandemic , Trump announced that he is freezing funding to the United Nations agency , pending a review of its novel coronavirus response . The decision shocked even some who have been critical of the organization 's handling of the crisis , particularly in relation to China . <p> To many , Trump 's allegations sound like an opportunistic effort to divert attention from his own early plaudits of China and the WHO and to deflect criticism of his sluggish response to the virus -- even after the WHO eventually declared a pandemic . <p> But criticism of how the WHO handled China is resonating well beyond the White House . <p> AD <p> In the early days of the crisis , the WHO amplified Chinese claims and figures without signaling that they could be inaccurate . The organization was slow to address the risk of human-to-human transmission , slow to declare a public health emergency and slow to use the term " pandemic . " <p> AD <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that China silenced whistleblowers and undercounted cases , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , the WHO 's director general , continued to heap compliments on Beijing and dodged questions about worrying problems with the Chinese response . <p> " You had the authority , you had the ability to challenge China , to question China as to what they were doing , and you needed to do that for global health , " said David Fidler , an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who has written about and worked with the WHO for years , referring to the organization . " You failed to do it . " <p> AD <p> Japan 's deputy prime minister recently called the WHO the " China Health Organization . " As of Wednesday evening , nearly 1 million people had signed an online petition calling for Tedros to resign . <p> This is partly a problem of expectations . The Geneva-based organization does many things well , but it is not particularly well equipped to guide the world through a pandemic . <p> The agency , founded in 1948 , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been praised in its efforts -- particularly in the developing world -- to expand vaccination programs for tuberculosis , polio and other infectious diseases . It is less adept in the kind of crisis currently gripping the world.Inan emergency -- when decisive action is necessary -- the WHO can coax and cajole , but it can not compel its members to do much . It also can not issue fines for noncompliance , for instance . <p> AD <p> AD <p> Since January , the WHO has been at the center of the global response , convening experts , disseminating research and urging countries to " test , test , test . " The organization has been praised for some of its technical work , most notably quickly distributing a test to more than 70 laboratories worldwide -- a test the United States chose not to use . The WHO also has shipped almost 2 million protective gear items to 74 countries , Tedros said , and plans to ship more . <p> It is not surprising to some who support the WHO 's mission that Trump has chosen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic . <p> " I think it 's a diversion from the fact that the U.S. did not respond as aggressively or as appropriately as we should have , " said Jimmy Kolker , a former U.S. ambassador who served as assistant secretary for global affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services until 2017 . <p> AD <p> AD <p> " There are lots of reasons for that , " he continued . " A minor one is that some of the information about what was happening in China was withheld longer than it should have been . " <p> But even the organization 's defenders , including current and former advisers , have questioned why the WHO kept lending credibility to China when it could have expressed more skepticism . <p> " That is what should have happened , " said Lawrence Gostin , a professor of global health law at Georgetown University , who also provides technical assistance to the WHO . " That was WHO 's responsibility . " <p> A WHO spokesman put the onus on member states to provide truthful information . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a timely and accurate manner , " Tarik Jasarevic said . " We have from the very beginning urged all countries to share data in a timely fashion , and we continue to do so . " <p> AD <p> AD <p> Public health advocates responded strongly after Trump 's announcement and worried that the funding freeze could have a catastrophic impact . Democrats in the United States said that the president does not have the legal authority to withhold money already approved by Congress . The president 's decision , said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) , is " dangerous , illegal and will be swiftly challenged . " According to the State Department , the United States has committed to providing the WHO with $893 million during its current two-year funding period . ( China has committed to $86 million during the same period . ) <p> " Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds , " Bill Gates , Microsoft co-founder and co-chairman of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation , tweeted Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them . The world needs @WHO now more than ever . " <p> Even those who have been critical of the WHO urge the Trump administration to reconsider . <p> AD <p> AD <p> German lawmaker Norbert R ? ttgen called the organization 's treatment of China " concerning " but said those concerns should be addressed when the crisis is over . This is not the time to freeze funding , he said in a tweet . Doing so " will harm those countries most that are least equipped to help themselves . " <p> And a freeze , warned Kristine Lee , an associate fellow at the Center for a New American Security , wo n't necessarily lead to results that Trump or his administration would welcome . Trump 's retreat from the WHO , she said , " makes it easier for Beijing to step in . " <h> Amplifying bad data <p> The WHO 's approach to emergency response was indelibly shaped by China 's attempts to conceal the 2002 SARS outbreak . <p> AD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empowered the organization to consider nonstate sources of information , such as details from nongovernmental groups on the ground , to assess threats . The goal : preventing coverups . It is not clear whether that has worked in the case of the coronavirus . <p> AD <p> In late 2019 , Chinese doctors in Wuhan started discussing a SARS-like ailment that was spreading through hospitals . They were detained for spreading rumors and shamed on state television . <p> China notified the WHO on Dec. 31 that there was a mysterious pneumonia in Wuhan . On Jan. 5 , the organization issued a statement saying that China had reported 44 cases . Chinese investigators reported no evidence of human-to-human transmission , the WHO statement said , or spread among medical workers . <p> AD <p> In a Jan. 14 tweet that Trump referenced last week , the WHO said Chinese authorities had still found " no clear evidence " of person-to-person transmission . There was no hint of skepticism or comment about the detention of doctors . <p> There were also signs that China was undercounting cases . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province , then the epicenter of the outbreak , held a Communist Party conclave . Each day during that time , the Wuhan Health Commission said that there were no new infections or deaths . At midnight on Jan. 18 , it resumed reporting cases -- a gap that raised eyebrows among scientists and researchers . <p> AD <p> If the WHO was concerned about the figures , it did not say so . " WHO just routinely repeated as if it were its own information , as if it were verifying it , " said Gostin , the Georgetown law professor . <p> " WHO is reliant on member states for data , but it could have noted gaps in the data or simply noted that they were not able to independently verify it , " he continued . " By uncritically citing Chinese data , WHO officials lent credibility to information that was false . " <p> In the meantime , the virus kept spreading , unchecked . It was not until Jan. 20 that Chinese officials acknowledged that the virus was spreading person to person . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases were in multiple Chinese cities , Japan , Korea , Thailand and -- later that day -- the United States . <p> In Geneva , an emergency panel convened to decide whether to declare a public health emergency of international concern , or PHEIC , a post-SARS term that signals a health crisis " that poses a public health risk to other countries through international spread . " <p> AD <p> On Jan. 23 , while the panelists were gathered , Chinese officials began locking down Wuhan . Officials in Geneva wrestled with whether to declare a PHEIC , weighing Chinese pushback about economic damage and assurances that everything was fine . <p> The committee was split but decided that it was not an emergency , surprising public health experts . <p> The panel waited until Jan. 30 -- a full month after Chinese doctors issued a warning -- to make the declaration . " The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken , " said Tedros , the WHO chief . " I left in absolutely no doubt about China 's commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In February and March , as evidence of a coverup intensified , the WHO continued to praised Beijing , baffling some experts . <p> By late January , for instance , Chinese officials acknowledged that they should have acted sooner . But the WHO and Tedros assured the world that they were doing great . <p> After meeting privately with Xi on Jan. 28 in Beijing , Tedros lauded the country 's handling of the outbreak , according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency , and the effectiveness of " China 's system . " <p> Some say that the flattery was strategic to allow an international team of doctors , scientists and observers to enter the country . But when a WHO team finally made it to China in mid-February , Tedros and his team did not modulate their tone . <p> At a news conference after an international team visited , Bruce Aylward , the head of the mission , called China 's work " stunning , " " extraordinary " and " successful . " <p> While there were certainly elements of China 's response that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aylward praising measures , such as travel bans , that the organization opposed . <p> They also wondered why Tedros waited until March 11 to say that covid-19 , by then ravaging multiple continents , was a pandemic . In public remarks , the WHO 's leadership sometimes stayed mum on basic matters of human rights . <p> At one news conference , Tedros was asked about China , including thedeath of a Chinese doctor whoalerted colleagues about thevirus , only to be detained by police . He first deferred to a colleague , then took the chance to speak . " It is very difficult , given the facts , " he said , " to say that China was hiding . " <h> A question of credibility <p> The organization 's messaging has been a boon for conservative critics of multilateral organizations , including Trump . <p> Former national security adviser John Bolton tweeted Friday that the WHO has been " fully penetrated by the Chinese , " echoing conservative claims that the agency and its leader have been co-opted . <p> There is no evidence that Tedros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WHO 's praise for China by applauding Beijing 's transparency on Jan. 24 , brushed off concerns about a coverup on Feb. 7 and on March 4 said China had the situation under control . <p> What is striking is the extent to which the WHO 's China messaging has overshadowed more successful elements of its response , eroding the agency 's credibility just when it needed it most . <p> Some critics have called for the agency to be scrapped . " What would you replace it with ? " asked David Heymann , a professor of infectious-disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who also advises the WHO . " Would it ever be possible to have 194 countries agree to a new organization ? " <p> Kelley Lee , a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada who wrote a book about the WHO and co-established the WHO Collaborating Center on Global Change and Health , said the coronavirus pandemic shows the need for a well-funded , capable agency .

When everyone has given up hope she finds it . Had Jacinda not given her Climate Change speech it is very possible NZ1st would not have joined Labour and the Greens and neoliberalism would n't have had a crack in it . <p> Of course neoliberalism can rely on 30 trillion in reinforcements from fveyes nations and should be considered the largest propaganda network ever assembled which is exactly what the analytical mind should be waiting for and before the lies start infecting kiwi brains those minds should have already been satanised and inoculated with Bombers Media strategy . See above . <p> New Zealand pays a heavy price for trade . China demands 50% of our capital , America has 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a merchant fleet of our own there 's no way around that . But most importantly a merchant fleet is an essential service and far more efficient than air freight , especially at a time when AirNZ is reducing its fleet by about half , or even more . So there are very complicated changes that must happen . <p> This is why we need to go full Savage . Mr Savage knew that New Zealand did n't have much energy resources so he and successive governments have borrowed billions in order to power a modern economy and in this economy you should n't be borrowing anymore than 5x your annual income which would give you plenty of time to save for retirement and live relatively comfortable lives . If you have n't been keeping up that 's a 300 billion energy policy . That would be over and above what the government has already planned for infrastructure spending including NZDFs , The Foreign Ministries , The Shane Jones AND the James Shaw fund so there 's about $70 billion in spending and it should be doubled for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are talking about 500 billion dollars of government spending over the next 15 years while at the same time maintaining the government budget at 30% of GDP until unemployment drops to 4% . <p> 300 billion on energy you might ask , yeah . The rule of thumb is it costs 1 million to generate 1 megawatt of renewables , 1 million for the associated infrastructure ( batteries , land , and stuff ) and 1 million for the new power lines , that 's about how much it would cost to fully electrify New Zealand 's transportation networks . We 'd still keep our hydro dams but we need extra capacity to charge vehicles and run an IT economy on top of our export economy , an economy that leverages every town with electric roads , electric rail , a bio diesel port , and a biofuel airport . We can jump into the science that backs renewable transportation energy if anyone likes , Iv done that her many times before but anyone , anywhere in New Zealand should be able to produce $240,000 worth of stuff and send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn that much but once they 've payed off creditors , taxes and outgoings means producing $240,000 is enough to maintain someone 's salary at the average about $50,000p/a sustainably . <p> 100,000 of these guys , gals , producing essential products and services while the other 100,000 thousand unemployed could be sent into the industrial sector would revolutionise the economy . <p> This is a long comment , $500 billion is to much money . Most people will give you 20 reasons why something will end up failing ( that 's before death cult capitalists chyme in ) . They 'll talk about frivolous spending on The Grand Fleet of communism , they 'll talk of suspensions of freedoms and they 'll talk of communism and beliefs in dark arts and magic . They 'll also talk about key moments in history when lefties in particular make mistakes like Rogernomics . Yknow RWNJ can bring a pea shooter and we can bring bazookas . <p> Now these are all valid points and observations but corona virus is just a small part in the larger failure of neoliberalism . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neoliberalism to combat corona . <p> Now why does unrest occur and why do seemingly normal people disrupt their own lives to go out and oppose a government ? This is an extremely important question to answer when you 're trying to end a global pandemic . A smart leader understands that a dictator with complete authoritarian control is still some what accountable to the people they govern . Identifying root causes of problems will allow descent to be countered effectively and also address any problems in your own style of rule . <p> An inflexible leader who 's completely unwilling to compromise will either be deposed or will be forced to enact such extreme rule we end up calling them Assade 2.0 . <p> At the beginning of neoliberalism everything seemed to go okay , there was very little unrest and debt was being paid . Neoliberalism 's repayment scheme centred around shrinking the government while at the same time expanding private sector borrowing . All of this spending soothed any concerns that the economy was heading into wave after wave of recessions and even a depression . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the verge of paying back all the governments debts . Just 4 more years and the government would have been debt free . But with this control of spending and borrowing the Prime Minister can embark on the largest projects New Zealand has ever seen and apart of that is to take control of New Zealand 's energy sector and Merchant fleet in order to reduce the cost of having to pay China and America just to keep our trade routes open which as the Chines and America military growth is concerned that is a cost that is rapidly growing . <p> Those that show support for a massive multi hundred billion dollar spend up on energy and transport will see progress in there businesses , sustainable profit , and growth . Those who oppose projects of this scale usually wear tinfoil hats while listening to Mike Hoskings under a 5G tower . Mean while the total global death toll of corona has moved past 150,000 . <p> The restriction on our human rights has massively changed the way the economy functions . So there has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so important to the way an economy performs and why Mike Hosking 's wears tinfoil hats . Overnight the central government has become the employer of last resort and what the people decide will be what they get . One of the first things the government has to do is double the number of students in polytechnics or university , and not just double the numbers , pass rates has to improve by greater than 95% . So we ca n't just increase the number of student places we have to improve teacher pay and student facilities . The economy has no use for unskilled labour any more . Tourism used to take up most if not all New Zealand 's uneducated people and that 's gone . <p> A weak government and lack of oversight and regulation means opportunities are abundant for anyone hungry for it and no one is more hungry than the Auckland Councils private real estate investors ( Yknow what the fuck I mean ) along with special tax exemptions has lead to cronyism , corporate hitmen and massive inequality . But still things seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now during global crises it 's obvious that governments naturally move towards a war economy . In WW2 capitalist nations pushed huge amounts of private sector workers in to the public sector for the war efforts . In WW1 car maker Renault agreed to supply France with tanks at cost , Henry Ford made similar moves in America and Germany used Jews as slave labour just to keep up ( did n't death cult capitalists like Mike Tinfiol Hosking 's advocate for slave wages to keep up ? Anyway ) . <p> In the short term war economies can generate large economic boost through Keynesian spending . Some might argue that it was n't the New Deal created by F.D.R that ended the Great Depression but the start of hostilities in WW2 but the massive amount of military spending also helped . And increases in taxes , war bonds and super sharp increases in spending did n't hurt the recovery at all . Following Pearl Harbour the US experienced 3 years of double digit growth where as the Finance Minster of NZ today would ask for 10-20% growth over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corona . But we are asking for the war like responses in peace time . <p> Granted GDP is n't that great a measure because a lot of politicians will try and skew the numbers to favour them and make rivals look bad . GDP has been held up as a wonderful thing but it has given close to no value to doctors , nurses , teachers and fire fighters and now small government mentality is n't so great . Sure military spending is n't a very good value metric but hundreds of billions in industrial policy and energy policy which lowers the cost of transportation and gives the vast majority of kiwis access to cheap transportation is far more valuable . <p> Efficient economic growth should have a multiplying effect on the economy . Efficient transportation decreases travel time and increases productivity , some people can turn there own automobile into an uber business ( or digital to transport ) as in taxi drivers or delivery drivers which further creates services for those who do n't have cars or ca n't drive . This will increase the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more opportunities to grow as well . <p> New Zealand can not compete with the large G20 populations and post corona those flaws are especially acute so we will always get outmuscled by heavier economies which forces us to be much , much faster than we 're used to being . Yes speed as in travel time is important but I 'm talking About the turn around of the whole New Zealand logistics system . Fast air travel is wonderful but how many have had luggage go missing or flight delays and disruptions ? Corona has presented New Zealanders with a once in a life time opportunity to ask what is the most efficient and effective transport pool and actually build it . <p> Now I would be a hypocrite if I only used GDP so if we look at the All Blacks pacific island players kiwi players are far more successful and because of our geographical and generic closeness we can say that that difference in success can be attributed to malnutrition , lack of education and lack of health care . So after decades of trying to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now this is in no small way to do with a massive amount of the workforce being involved in inflating the balance sheets of foreign investors . That means a lot of spending and innovation and a lack of that economic multiplier we were talking about . <p> What makes corona even more special is the realization that the Chines and American military industrial complex is n't designed to fight each other , rather than suppress its own people . Even if Trump was n't president the need to jail darkies would have over inflated U.S GDP figures anyway . By now every liberal western democracy has lost its right to rule because there 's no type of neoliberal reform that can save the people from corona . We know this and it must harden our resolve against those who goes against us ( like tinfoil Hoskings ) <p> A lot of times the political economy focuses on fear and emotion when in reality the governments one job is to create a safe and stable system for its people to prosper and in this case we must demand Jacinda succeeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ... " In theory Sam . Not in practice . Government as we interpret it to be , has become a veneer for corporate interests , masquerading as democracy . I 'm amazed you ca n't see the reality . Neo liberal has married socialism haha . <p> So I always go with the consensus on theoretical calculations because it 's just an ad hoc of stuff we do n't need . This type of philosophy does n't really do anything which is why scientists just reject political ideology wholesale . You 're , PhillJ , pretty much just adding in properties to my TL ; DR comment that no one needs . <p> So I 'm not a democrat or a republican . It 's interesting for me to sit between them which may sound confusing but only if you can ignore the fact that a response to a pandemic requires a global response . So rich nations must insure that poorer nations get enough medical resources to genocide corona on a global scale .

@@31795241 <h> Pepper 's bra wants to solve the woes of small-chested women <p> Ask any woman and she will tell you that most of her bras do not fit her optimally . In fact , a majority of women end up wearing the wrong size . A large part of the problem is that sizing is standardized , unlike women 's bodies . With every passing year , more people are also shopping online , meaning fewer opportunities to actually try on bras -- a trend that 's only accelerating given the shutdown the world is experiencing right now . <p> One particular problem , and a widespread one , according to entrepreneurs Jaclyn Fu and Lia Winograd , is that bras are generally too big for small-chested women . It 's the reason the former co-workers came together to found Pepper , a three-year-old , Denver-based startup that 's expressly focused on creating bras that fit smaller cup sizes . <p> As Fu explains it , most bra companies use a size , say 36C , then apply that same design to other bra sizes , like a 32A . While the step is logistically sound -- applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't translate well into actual fit . <p> " It means a person who is a 32A is wearing a design that was intended for a 36C , causing fit issues like cup gaps , " says Fu . <p> Usually , women try to resolve the problem by tightening their bra straps or changing sizes , but Pepper 's solution is to create its own , smaller cup molds from a factory in Medellin , Colombia , where Winograd grew up . <p> Fu made the first prototype for Pepper based on her own chest size . Since then , she 's gone to customers ' houses to conduct fittings and research . Beyond cup size , Pepper also addresses underwire woes , making its products less curved and shorter to follow the natural size of a smaller-chested woman . <p> To increase customer engagement , Pepper started virtual one-to-one fit sessions for customers who are buying a bra online for the first time , and like other companies has a " fit quiz " for people to take online , too . <p> Pepper now sells a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 38B , and prices range from $48 to $54 . <p> Pepper certainly is n't the only startup trying to fit into the bra industry .

ThirdLove brands itself as a brand that sells a " bra for every body " with inclusive sizes , and is now expanding into retail , international markets and swim and athletic wear . The company was last valued at more than $750 million . <p> It 's unclear how many new brands the market can support , or that can survive this pandemic .

In 2019 , most of its sales came directly from consumers on their site -- a good sign that its growth ties to user loyalty versus relying on partnerships with retailers . <p> The nuance of buying a bra has long been an in-person ordeal . But now , because of COVID-19 's spread and the resulting shut down of many brick-and-mortar stores , those who need a new bra might have to turn online for the very first time .

A 2013 study of discharged I.C.U . patients , many of whom had been intubated , found that , three months after leaving the I.C.U. , forty per cent of them had cognitive test scores one and a half standard deviations below the mean -- roughly equivalent to the effect of a moderate traumatic brain injury . A quarter showed cognitive declines comparable to early Alzheimer 's disease . The longer patients were in the I.C.U. , the worse the consequences became . <p> The joy we all feel when patients at our hospital survive acute COVID-19 is followed , quickly , by the acknowledgment that it could be a long time before they fully recover , if they ever do .

Roughly two-thirds of family caregivers show depressive symptoms after a loved one 's stay in the I.C.U . Many continue to struggle years later . <p> Lindsay Lief , a critical-care physician at my hospital , runs a clinic for patients who have left the I.C.U. , including those suffering from what 's known as post-I.C.U. syndrome . Lief got the idea for the clinic years ago , after caring for a forty-year-old woman from New Jersey who developed a serious infection , followed by profound septic shock . In the I.C.U. , the woman 's kidneys shut down ; she needed dialysis ; she could n't breathe . She was intubated , extubated , intubated , extubated . When , after weeks of treatment , she was finally in stable condition , Lief began thinking about what it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This lady had such a traumatic I.C.U . course , " she said . " And I 'm going to send her back to Jersey with no support -- just a few papers about what we did ? That seemed crazy . " <p> When Lief started the clinic , she saw patients by herself , most several weeks out from discharge . Lief would walk them through what had happened in the hospital -- for many , it was a blur . She 'd screen them for depression , anxiety , and P.T.S.D. , and assess how they were managing at home . Were they gaining back the weight they 'd lost in the I.C.U. ? Had their sleep improved ? She 'd run through the medications they were taking and stop the ones that were no longer needed . Over time , she added psychologists , therapists , nutritionists , pharmacists , and social workers to her team . <p> " We try to offer holistic , whole-person care , " Lief told me . " Sometimes patients have already seen twenty doctors . They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no one has asked , ' How are you doing with all this ? ' " Patients , she learned , feel frustrated by their dependence on others . They ca n't return to work ; they 're forced to take taxis because they ca n't climb the subway stairs . Others have trouble paying bills and keeping track of medical appointments . " Often , what these patients need is not a doctor , " Lief said . " They need physical therapy , occupational therapy , social interaction , case managers , financial planners . They need people to help them get their lives back . " <p> To contend with the flood of patients who will be extubated in the coming weeks , we 're planning to create a COVID-19 survivors unit -- essentially an in-patient version of Lief 's outpatient clinic . The unit will bring together clinicians from various backgrounds : hospitalists , pulmonologists , rehab specialists , psychiatrists , dieticians , therapists . It will develop COVID-19-specific protocols , which we hope will help patients progress to a fuller recovery . Patients will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reducing oxygen support and slowly building strength and endurance . They 'll learn breathing techniques and get help with gadgets they can use to clear mucus from the lungs . Some will be shown how to cough better . Physical and occupational therapists will help them recover motor skills that may have diminished during their hospitalizations ; psychiatrists and nutritionists will help with mood and food . Many patients , because they are too sick , or need oxygen , or because no rehab facility will accept them , will need to spend days or weeks recovering in the hospital . " The best thing we can do is create a home-like environment , " Lief told me . " The whole point is to help them stop being patients and start feeling human again . " <p> We tend to think of extubation as the point when a patient begins breathing independently . But , in fact , it 's possible to be extubated while still depending on a ventilator to breathe . If the thick intubation tube -- inserted into the mouth , pushed through the vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in too long , it can damage surrounding tissue ; when that time comes , doctors make a small hole in the front of the neck , just below the thyroid gland , and insert a thin tracheostomy tube directly into the windpipe .

In Chelsea , a working-class , predominantly Hispanic town near Boston , as much as one-third of the population is thought to have had the virus . George Alba , an I.C.U . doctor in Boston , told me that his hospital , which has seen a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases , has also had to start using tracheostomy tubes for patients who remain dependent on ventilators . To the well-known problems of ventilator and respiratory-staff shortages , tracheostomies add an infection-control issue : the tube into the windpipe provides a ready path for aerosolization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm concerned about the plateau , " he said .

" <p> Alba , too , has been working with his colleagues to create a comprehensive follow-up clinic for patients who have survived severe COVID-19 . He hopes that the clinic will also help researchers study the long-term effects of the virus . How much lung damage will remain ? Will the immune system return to normal ? Does hard-won immunity persist , or wane with time ? Initially , the clinic will operate through telemedicine ; eventually , it will function as a hub through which patients can access a battery of tests and services -- pulmonary-function tests , blood samples , cognitive assessments , and referrals to other specialties . <p> COVID-19 patients who are n't intubated -- the vast majority -- may also struggle to return to their prior lives .

When they 're discharged , these patients are given an oxygen monitor and scheduled for a video call with a sports-medicine specialist .

" Believe me , watching someone step in place for two straight minutes feels like an eternity , " Alfred Gellhorn , the rehabilitation specialist who 's leading the effort , told me . " But it gives you an important sense of their ability and endurance . " <p> COVID-19 has forced us to deliver remote rehabilitation , which may seem suboptimal . But evidence is emerging that , for the right patients , telemedicine-based programs are just as good as those delivered in person .

@@31797741 <p> I reflect back on an April 4 , 2017 piece about Jason Mudrick 's bold call that malls were in a forever decline . <p> A lot of money has been lost because investors thought like landlords and not like tenants , who actually pay the landlord 's bills . <p> I would argue that malls are in secular decline and that even Class ' A ' malls are overrated . <p> On April 4 , 2017 , I penned a piece : Hedge Fund Analyst Jason Mudrick Claims : Decline In Malls Is A Forever Trend . Within the piece , I suggested that Jason 's claim was a bit hyperbolic and noted that it can be quite profitable to bet against the popular wisdom of the day . My thought process then was that a lot of pessimism was priced in and that is often super dangerous to make such a bold claim like a ' forever trend ' . So although I did make some good money in Macy 's ( M ) during its brief run up to just north of $40 per share , in the summer of 2018 , at least at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold call was exceptionally prescient . I tip my cap to Jason and it looks like he has cashed in on this short mall bet . <p> At the time of my April 2017 article , it was my understanding that his firm had $1.6 billion in assets under management . Per Whalewisdom , it appears that his firm now manages $2.4 billion . The market has handsomely rewarded him by giving him large pools of capital to management . That is the dynamism of this investing game we all love . <p> Now , this is a perfect segue to discuss Mall REITs . As there is a large contingent of Seeking Alpha readers that are retired or nearing retirement , and because of their income ( dividend ) characteristics , Mall REITs are extremely popular on SA . Although I was on a fourteen-month writing sabbatical , which prevented me from writing on SA , I have been tracking and closely following the sector for a few years now . I have read almost all SA articles on Simon Property Group , Inc . ( SPG ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc . ( TCO ) , Brookfield Property Partners L.P. ( BPY ) , Tanger Factory Outlet Centers , Inc . ( SKT ) , Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust ( PEI ) , Washington Prime Group ( WPG ) , and ( of course ) CBL &amp; Associates Properties , Inc . ( CBL ) . <p> So although , I was n't publicly writing during that time period , my close investment friends that know me and who I regularly discuss investment ideas with , would freely admit that I have been bending their ear since early 2019 about my extremely bearish on malls . As I developed this view from doing more work and digging into the weeds in early 2019 and throughout 2019 and well into 2020 for that matter . <p> That said , early 2019 is ancient history now , so there is no point spending too much time on that bearishness as it does n't help anyone or really matter . The only good part ( or perhaps lucky part ) was that I was able to sidestep some massive losses in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , that said , I am by no means throwing stones from my panoramic glass home . I have made plenty of investment mistakes from 2017 through 2020 , as I shared in my recent piece : Radical Transparency and Confirmation Bias . Moreover , during the Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 , I aggressively added to my Macy 's long bet ( see my recent piece : It 's Time For Jeff Gennette To Sell Herald Square ) . Now you might say , why would you be aggressively betting on Macy 's when you were so bearish on both malls and Mall REITs . Quite simply , I thought and still do , that Macy 's is unique given its awesome Macy's.com business , the potential of Backstage , bluemercury , Bloomingdale 's solid niche position in the luxury segment , and my steadfast belief Macy 's has important supplier relationships with fashionable and desirable brands that consumers continue to want to wear and buy . So despite my concerns about the secular decline of malls , admittedly , I did n't think the magnitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I held my nose and bought more Macy 's . In the end , though , Macy 's exceptionally valuable owned real estate was always my firewall as well as Macy 's strong EBITDA generation , at least before the COVID-19 pandemic . <h> Sometimes The Simplest Theory Is The Best Theory <p> For anyone that follows this sector or has been unfortunately invested in this sector , most likely as you were looking for income , in a low interest rate world , we all know these stocks have gotten taken to the woodshed . <p> However , notwithstanding the distinct possibility of a sharp bear market rally ( for the sector , not all overall market per se , as Malls REITs are a tiny slice of the overall/broader equity market ) or dead cat bounce , I hate to say it , malls are in secular decline . I think Jason is right , this is a forever trend . <h> Key Nuance <p> The fundamental problem with malls is that far too many of interior tenants simply could n't afford the all in occupancy cost ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the COVID-19 pandemic ( so this includes rent , taxes , and shared common maintenance expenses ) as mall traffic has been problematic . Moreover , e-commerce makes price discovery easy , and this erodes gross margins for mall retailers ( and all retailers ) , at least those retailers selling undifferentiated products . <p> As someone who almost exclusively follows and invests in the retail sector ( I also am long two natural gas stocks : Antero Resources ( AR ) and Range Resources ( RRC ) , I spent a lot of time reading conference calls . For anyone paying attention and actively reading , it was crystal clear , way back in early 2019 that some of the country 's sharpest retail CFO 's were devising a plan to ' exit stage left ' and combing through the lease expiration dates of their entire mall portfolios . Arguably this was one of CFO 's top three priorities in 2019 and beyond . <p> Now if you might be skeptical and thinking that I am cherry-picking and playing Monday Morning Quarterback . You might also be thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vacate their space ? <p> And my response is no question many of these small players will go bankrupt , but I 'm also talking about big players , that lease a lot of space . <p> Let 's travel back in time and look at what then GAP ( GPS ) CEO , Arthur Peck , said it 's about store count . <p> Enclosed below is a conference call excerpt , as I distinctly remember reading this as I was then playing Detective Columbo and starting to work out what was happening under the surface . <h> Arthur Peck 's opening remarks February 28 , 2020 <p> For another example , on May 20 , 2019 , Ascena Retail Groups , Inc . ( ASNA ) boldly informed the market and its landlords that they were deftly closing 600 Dressbarn stores during the 2019 . Now Ascena owns other strong brands , such as Ann Taylor , Loft , some plus-sized women 's stores , the kids brand Justice , and has a minority JV interest in Maurice 's , but 600 is a lot of stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs , but posting all of them would be boring and detract from my forward-looking message . Essentially , if investors were open-minded enough and considered that this was more than a cyclical trend , they might have avoided this sector . Our confirmation biases get reinforced and we go back and look at strong rearview mirror metrics to assure ourselves . Speaking of confirmation bias , we tell ourselves that Simon Property Group is invincible , they own trophy properties in highly populated areas with favorable disposable income , they can borrow money at super low rates , their CEO is smarter than the rest of the industry . Yet , its stocks continue to go lower . <p> By the way , I read the David Simon 's now infamous ( zig-zag ) conference call February 4 , 2020 conference call . I came away befuddled by his confirmation bias . During the call , analysts were puzzled that Simon had n't bought back any stock , given the then relatively low stock price . Analysts were persistent and really pressed him on the topic as they sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least during the call , Mr. Simon keeps deflecting and playing coy , especially when a Bloomberg report ( during the conference call ) broke that Simon was close to a deal to buy Taubman . Lo and behold , on February 10 , 2020 , Simon announced that it agreed to acquire Taubman and for a large premium . After learning about the deal , again on February 10th , I distinctly recall telling a friend that Icarus ( Mr. Simon ) flew too close to the sun this time . Now David Simon is wealthier than I will ever be ( at least financially ) and in the old paradigm , he built a great company . However , the world changed and Simon has been caught flat-footed . In a COVID-19 world and post COVID-19 , the secular decline of malls has been dramatically accelerated and pulled forward . I expect a multitude of potential bankruptcies by tenants and some mall REITs . <p> Speaking of Simon Property Group , the anointed king of class " A " malls , if you actually take the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depending on where you live ) you quickly work out that Simon owns plenty of great malls as well as some really weak malls . Per Simon 's FY 2019 10-K , in the United States , the company owns or has a majority interest in 106 enclosed malls , 69 outlet malls , 14 mill properties , and 4 lifestyle centers . <p> I live in Massachusetts and have visited every one of Simon 's 11 Massachusetts malls . <p> Auburn Mall <p> Burlington Mall <p> Cape Cod Mall ( Hyannis , MA ) <p> Copley Place ( Boston , MA ) <p> Emerald Square ( North Attleboro , MA ) <p> Northshore Mall ( Peabody , MA ) <p> Shops at Chestnut Hill ( Newton , MA ) <p> Solomon Pond ( Marlborough , MA ) <p> Southshore Mall ( Braintree , MA ) <p> Square One Mall ( Saugus , MA ) <p> Wrentham Premium Outlet ( Plainville , MA ) <p> No question Simon 's Southshore , Copley Place , Shops at Chestnut Hill , and Northshore malls are definitely " A " malls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong mix of tenants . Burlington Mall and Wrentham Premium Outlet are solid . Walking through many of these malls , as I like to do channel checks , in January 2020 , there were some vacancies , but nothing eye-popping . <p> However , Emerald Square , Auburn Mall , and Square One Mall are terrible . The amount of vacancies is staggering ( notably Emerald Square ) . Admittedly , with an exception of some Simon Florida malls , I have n't traveled to the rest of Simon 's stores , but I just want to explain to readers that even Simon Property Group owns some malls that have are most likely worth zero given the low occupancy levels and declining mall traffic . <p> Moreover , on November 11 , 2019 , fellow SA contributor , Adam Levine Weinberg , CFA penned one of his best articles : Mall REIT Investors : Beware of Tesla . I 'm a fan of Adam 's work , as he is always thorough , but these piece standouts for its insights and unique perspective . Within his piece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Store ( AAPL ) dramatically skew the average sales per square foot key metrics . And if you read the subtext , it means that class A mall operators are painting a more rosy picture of the mall 's underlying value proposition and traffic levels . Bullish Mall REIT authors have cited these strong metrics as evidence of their bullish thesis , yet the reality is that Tesla and Apple are major exceptions . <h> Think like a tenant and not a landlord <p> The linchpin to the ultimate trajectory of Mall REITs ' future stock prices boils down to can underlying tenants make money signing new or renewing existing leases in these malls ? In other words , is there a compelling value proposition for tenants such that the all-in occupancy cost ( the fixed initial build out cost to outfit the space is a sunk cost for renewals ) generate enough sales to make this a compelling investment decision for tenants . This is the most important question that Mall REIT investors need to model , wrestle with , and research ! Unfortunately , I think many investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their shiny and fat dividends and did n't do nearly enough work on the value proposition for underling tenants . They thought like landlord and not like tenant , and yet tenants ultimately pay those shiny and once fat dividend checks ! <p> Finally , given the inherent debt levels , as these malls are n't exactly inexpensive to build or maintain , the entire business model is built on the bedrock assumption of at least 93% to 95% occupancy as well as gradual rent increases . <p> Based on my the proliferation of e-commerce and the dominance of Amazon ( AMZN ) ( now even more amplified by the shelter in place mandates ) , I would argue , in most cases , that being a tenant in any mall just is n't a compelling idea for any talented CFO . Moreover , I would argue that some of the sharpest retail CFO 's have been busy beavers rolling up their sleeves and working with their real estate groups to devise a plan to streamline and optimize their physical store fleet . Occupancy costs as percentage of revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CFO , with a large retail fleet , first up on the chopping block , at least in most cases , would be enclosed malls because the all-in occupancy cost relative to sales ( think occupancy cost as a percent of rent ) is no longer compelling in post-COVID-19 ( and it probably was n't in 2019 either ) . Not to mention that Amazon only gets stronger by the day . <p> As for the future stock prices , of the Mall REITs , I think we will see bankruptcies and lot of malls , at the individual property level , enter Chapter 7 status . Mall REITs have already handed the keys back to banks when the value of the underlying mall exceeds the principal balance left on the debt . Depending on the area , it is n't hard to envision many malls will be physically knocked down and the land will be repurposed for other uses ( apartments , office buildings , etc . ) . <p> Now that said , these stocks have been battered . Could they all experience a nice dead cat bounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these stocks might even exhibit a rip your face off type stock squeezes , as this has been one of the most lucrative hedge fund shorts in recent history . And the short interest remains elevated as many hedge funds are greedy . <p> However , do n't confuse a dead cat bounce or an impressive short squeeze with a trend change and renaissance revival . That said , it is probably way too late to sell these stocks , the better name ( SPG , BPY , MAC , SKT , etc. ) but I would opportunistically exit stage left if that short squeeze ensues . Remember , do n't think about your cost basis and do n't look a gift horse in the mouth . <p> Source : Yahoo Finance <p> Finally , I would argue that taking a loss on a bet that we felt good about is one of the hardest things to do as investor . Besides losing money , it dings our ego , even more so when we were so sure that the idea would play out . And when a bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias .

And let me be clear , as I write this from my panoramic glass home , I have been guilty of this behavioral pattern and it has cost me a lot of money and even more opportunity cost . <p> This piece was long overdue , but this was the earliest I could write it , given my corporate consulting gig .

The Prime Minister would have been aware that even in more normal times , the NHS is , by far and away , Britain 's most popular public institution . And in the midst of the Coronavirus crisis , healthcare workers are the heroes and heroines of the hour . Thus , in describing the NHS as " unconquerable , " he was aligning himself with the mood of the nation while also talking up the ability of the service to deliver life-saving care in the most extreme of circumstances . <p> But the NHS - like healthcare systems almost everywhere - is struggling to cope . It still faces shortages of personal protection equipment ( PPE ) and just at the moment admissions to hospital are expected to peak , many key members of staff are stuck in self-isolation having displayed COVID-19 symptoms . The problem of staff absence is exacerbated by a continuing shortfall in testing to confirm whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more widely , it seems unlikely that Britain 's public health authorities will hit their testing target any time soon . Without widespread testing , it will be difficult to come out of lockdown . Difficult times . <p> So what role , if any , can entrepreneurs working in the healthtech sector play in helping the NHS - and indeed providers - cope with the pressures created by the pandemic ? <p> Now , this is probably not the time to bang the gong for Britain 's tech entrepreneurs . Politicians , managers and clinicians are engaged in a battle to get ahead of the COVID-19 outbreak and they do n't necessarily have the time or energy to actively bring new services and solutions on board at any kind of pace . <p> That said , in areas such as testing , staff deployment and even the supply of equipment , a few private-sector startup companies may be able to provide genuinely useful and meaningful help . The question is , how easy is it for healthtech startups to engage with government and the NHS at this time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different experiences . <p> Sourcing Staff <p> Melissa Morris is CEO and co-founder of Lantum , a healthcare workforce management platform that matches clinical capacity with demand . Having managed to get a foot in Britain 's public health system by enabling primary healthcare providers to source locums , it is now also helping to manage staffing requirements for some of the tele-healthcare operations , clinics and treatment centers that are engaged in fighting the virus . <p> As Morris explains , securing a foothold within Britain 's healthcare system was n't straightforward or easy , not least because the NHS is made up of a myriad of providers . And depending on the nature of the solution , procurement of third party products or services might be done at a national level or locally . In addition , regular restructuring of the health service can mean that it is difficult to keep track of where purchasing decisions are made . Morris cites her own experience . " I started my career working at NHS London , " she says . " That was expanded to become NHS England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to pinpoint decision-makers . " <p> Lantum decided to focus on primary care . " We went door to door talking to GP practices , " she says . " And as we began to build market share , we had more to talk about when we approached other potential customers . We built relationships . <p> Today , Lantum has around 21,000 clinicians on its books and provides a service to 2,000 GP practices . <p> According to Morris , it is become easier for tech-driven startups to get on the NHS radar screen . " Things have got better since the arrival of Matt Hancock as Health Secretary , " she says . " He started NHS X , a central hub that makes decisions on anything digital within the NHS . " <p> Lantum also took part in NHS Innovate , an accelerator program . " That gave us exposure to senior figures , " Morris adds . <p> In terms of the COVID-19 crisis , Morris says the relationships and links built up over time have enabled Lantum to supply not only staff management services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spikes in demand for clinicians . <p> Sniffing Out The Virus <p> Ancon Medical has , so far , had less success in building relationships within the NHS , despite developing a technology that could , according to CEO Wesley Baker , prove a game-changer in testing for COVID-19 . <p> Founded by Dr. Boris Gorbunov , Ancon Medical has created a device that can detect a range of illnesses by analyzing chemical biomarkers in human breath . The applications include the early detection of cancers , ebola and , crucially , Coronaviruses . <p> " We did a trial in the US to detect influenza viruses , " says Baker . " We were blown away . We detected six cases of Coronavirus . We know we can do virus detection and we know we can detect Coronavirus . " <p> Baker has spoken with Health Secretary Matt Hancock but , to date , the company has n't succeeded in persuading the U.K. or the E.U. to sanction trials . " However , we are getting traction in the U.S. , " Baker adds . And while Baker welcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't helped Ancon , <p> So what happens next ? Baker says Ancon Medical 's tech offers a faster ( results come back very quickly ) and more cost-effective means to test for illnesses than conventional methods . It is also non-invasive , which may be a relief for those who currently face tests that involve swabs being inserted uncomfortably into the subject 's nostrils . In a bid to get that message across , Baker has spoken to his local MP and the company has also been in contact with former government health ministers , who may be able to provide introductions . <p> Ancon is playing a longer game . Once a disease has been profiled the device can be applied to a wide range of analysis tasks . As such , the company 's selling point extends far beyond the current crisis . There is , however , clear frustration at the progress to date , given that the company 's technology has already been used by the miltary in areas such as germ warfare detection . <p> Given the growing size of the healthtech startup community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances are a whole range of useful solutions are waiting to be deployed . But the truth is that public healthcare systems are often not easy to access and where tests and treatments are concerned adoption tends to be ( rightly ) a lengthy process due to the tests required .

" No other partner is listed in the " funding " department , not even Amazon , which is listed as a provider of " infrastructure and logistics capability . " <p> That funding detail matters in a sector where the public number attached to home COVID-19 tests hovers around the $120-per-test mark , including LabCorp 's Pixel kit , which received FDA approval earlier this week as the " first authorized diagnostic test with a home collection option for COVID-19 .

The complete process took eight minutes . <p> Unlike LabCorp 's take-home Pixel kit , which comes with cotton swabs , the one I received from SCAN relies on a wholly plastic " scraper " piece .

" Either way , it 's much less invasive than the multiple inches of swab depth seen in other nasopharyngeal techniques , like this one demonstrated by the New England Journal of Medicine last week . <p> Notice the language in SCAN 's instructions ( along with instruction-manual images in the top gallery ) . What might that language lead you to believe about the swabbing procedure ? In my case , I assumed it meant firmly pressing the swab 's tip against the skin inside my nose , then simply rotating the whole thing -- so that it scraped against one wall of my nasal cavity . <p> While putting this article together , I discovered that SCAN 's main portal , which I blew past in the rush of trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video is n't mentioned anywhere in the included pamphlet , and it was n't referred to or linked in any of the emails I received or any of the " you have successfully signed up " messaging within the Web portal ( which I would have gladly watched while waiting roughly one day for my test to arrive ) . <p> SCAN 's official video reveals an entirely different kind of swab rotation , so that it touches all of the skin in your nasal cavity .

Go on a date ? <p> Antibody tests are currently all over the map and probably will be some time until you can stabilize them in terms of sensitivity and specificity . And antibody tests need blood so that is a bit of a barrier to very high volume approaches . <p> Unfortunately , it 's going to be a long , slow slog down here on the ground . Governors are starting to open up their statesbefore their support teams are happy with it . I can understand everyone 's concern .

Not exactly what you would hope to do . <p> I believe the PCR test that you took only measures whether you are currently infected . You are not . <p> If you want to know whether you had it in the past , you need the serology test ( blood test ) that measures antibodies . <p> Some antibody tests for other viruses seem to be done using things like mouth swabs but I gather they have a lot of issues like high false positive rates . A few years ago I was tested for Hepatitis C using one of those which said I had antibodies which was odd because I could n't think of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up blood test showed that no virus was present so I was given the all clear . Last year I had another batch of tests including HepC but these were all blood tests and interestingly there were no antibodies present which suggests that the original positive result was indeed false . <p> Looking for current infection does n't appear to be that useful . Research is showing that anywhere from 50% to 80% of people with coronavirus show no symptoms at all so they 're highly unlikely to get tested . Reliable antibody testing would be a game changer and could give a much clearer view of the spread of the virus and things like mortality rates . <p> I got a " not detected " result from a PCR test as well - and it was administered by medical personnel and I definitely had the " get this out if my nose ! " feeling . But , I 'm SURE I had COVID-19 . ( Several/most of the tell-tale symptoms , not just one or two ; and it occurred after 10 days of isolation , longer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the test was more than a week after I had symptoms , and apparently for peak accuracy these PCR tests need to be done fairly immediately when symptoms begin . Or at least while they are still ongoing . <p> I asked some knowledgeable people whether this indicated a problem , as far as gauging how many people really have/had the virus , and the answer was , roughly : a false negative is preferable to a false positive . So these " not detected " results are going to be fairly common - at least , more common than most lay people probably expect . <p> I do wonder how the sensitivity and specificity of this test compares to the other PCR ones currently available . Would be nice if the test was provide to third parties for confirmation . In general aside from the WHO RT-PCR test alot of the other ones are n't great . <p> A European group Finddx has been collating 3rd party evaluations of various testing methods that are available , PCR , Antibody and Antigen ( https : **34;240;TOOLONG ) and alot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , I think at the moment one would have to be highly dubious of any AB based test result . Worth keeping in mind when you see all the antibody test headlines . <p> I would n't want to be making any critical decisions on many of these tests ... <p> The site has smaller amounts of data for PCR and Antigen based tests , and there own testing of PCR based kits . There own internal testing of different PCR methods has average sensitivity and specificity at around 98-99% ( worst is 90% ( 95%CI : 79 , 96 ) , best 100% ( 95%CI:93 , 100 ) for sensitivity ) . Much better than the antibody tests ! <p> I 'm struggling with the nature of the antibody tests . From my experience , antibody tests require that you ultimately use a bit of the virus , rather than whole , dead virus , to " capture " anti-viral antibodies , and measure the total amount of antibody that has been captured , using a colour/fluorescence assay . So the assay is very dependent upon what bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since infected patients will probably mount an antibody response to various components of the virus , any single antibody test will not necessary reflect exactly what antibodies that patient has developed . The test also does n't necessarily show whether the patient 's antibodies are capable of neutralising the virus , or not , For example , if the patient mounts an immune response to bits of the virus which tend to only be exposed once the virus is inside the cell , then these antibodies in the patient 's circulation are n't going to be able to attach and neutralise circulating virus . <p> Edit : Wow , fascinated by the downvote . From an antivaxxer , or a bot ? I 'm not saying that antibody tests should n't be done . They 'll be very valuable in understanding who seroconverts , and whether that seroconversion provides immunity , and for how long . I 'm simply saying that antibody tests are a long way from yes/no answers <p> I do wonder how the sensitivity and specificity of this test compares to the other PCR ones currently available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third parties for confirmation .

In general aside from the WHO RT-PCR test alot of the other ones are n't great . <p> Since the terms " sensitivity " and " specificity " were mentioned here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistical measures to be super confusingly named , I wanted to just drop in some info about these terms and what they mean : <p> Sensitivity means how good the test is at detecting the virus . If you have the virus , and the test has 95% sensitivity , then it will report a positive result 95% of the time . It 's the number of people who test positive divided by the number of people who actually are positive . Or , if you prefer , true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives . ( In data science contexts , this is also sometimes called " recall " . ) <p> Specificity is the flip side of sensitivity . It 's how good the test is at detecting that the virus is n't present . If you are n't infected , and the test has 95% specificity , there is a 5% chance that it will report a positive result anyway . It 's the number of people who test negative divided by the number of people who actually are negative . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of true negatives and false positives . <p> There are other measures of statistical correctness used in data science , like precision ( what percentage of positive results are true positives ) or accuracy ( what percentage of test results match the ground truth ) , but these are disfavored in evaluating medical tests because they can get skewed depending on what percentage of the sample set is actually positive or negative . <p> In the case of the antibody tests mentioned above , which would most likely be used to determine when a person had an asymptomatic infection and has a good chance of currently being immune , that 's probably the direction we would want to err on . Those tests mostly show up as highly specific , meaning they do n't give false positives very often , while they miss detecting the antibodies a fair amount of the time . We would want people to be extra cautious , so if an antibody test comes back positive , we want to be really sure about that - but the only real harm in an antibody test coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures for a while longer . <p> At the direction of my doctor , Dr. Linda Lancaster , who reminded me that this is an oxygen-depleting virus , she suggested I take a bath and add a nominal amount of bleach .

As the Army Commander Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva who is also the Head of the National Operation Centre for Prevention of COVID 19 Outbreak ( NOCPC ) described it , the security forces are active in the ongoing quarantine work , isolation process for villages , community responsibilities , detection of positive cases and tracing contacts , helping to conduct PCR tests and diagnosing work , and prognosis for coming weeks . <p> The decision to deploy the army to arrest the community transmission was taken by a team of top officials led by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa considering their manpower and logistical capabilities and resilience to respond in a calamity such as this . <p> Their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense and earned them kudos from all quarters of society . <p> Since the first emergency quarantine centre set up within days by the Army in Diyatalawa for the 33 students flown from Wuhan , China at the very outset ( February 1 ) , and it 's success story , the Tri-forces have set up 52 quarantine centres island wide . <p> The first leg of the quarantine process began with a rescue mission , Deputy Director -Directorate of Preventive Medicine and Mental Health Services Colonel Seveen Semage who over sees the quarantine centres said in retrospect . None of the 33 students who were whisked away from Wuhan soon after the outbreak , contracted the deadly virus . Had there been feet dragging by the Government and other stakeholders when the matter was raised , their story would have ended in tragedy , he said . <p> The second leg of the quarantine process began on March 10 . At first Sri Lankan migrant workers flown back from Iran , South Korea and Italy arrived at the centres . Later the Government decided to bring down the stranded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate pleas . During this phase over 3,500 were sheltered in 46 camps . This included 31 foreigners who volunteered to take part in the quarantine process . The centres were manned by the SL Army , Navy and the Air Force . <p> While some of the people who arrived at the centres at this leg , completed only 14 days of quarantine , others who were tested positive had to stay longer , in some instances , up to over 30 days . Despite the inconvenience , the people cooperated . They did not make the already burdened life of the security personnel , extra hard . It is not to say there were no resistance at all . <p> At first , the returnees protested against state quarantine at military run centres . But with time they realised the sacrifices the military personnel were making to save lives , during this deadly pandemic . <p> " Among these 3,500 people we detected 36 Covid 19 positive cases .

Compared to the rates of health workers getting compromised in developed countries , Sri Lanka 's story has been positive so far . <p> Those who were quarantined at the centres were asked to self quarantine in their homes for a further two weeks after two people were tested positive for Covid 19 following their initial 14 days qurantine at military run centres . " We realised subsequently that the incubation period for Covid 19 can be more than 14 days in some cases and prompt action was taken to contain this threat , " he said . <p> Col.

Anyone developing severe symptoms are immediately attended to and transferred to the IDH for specialist care . <p> The seven deaths of Covid 19 patients in the country so far were late arrivals and the 44 year old man who died at a quarantine centre had hidden his symptoms for nine days , according to Col. Semage . When the man was finally tested positive for Covid 19 , he had already developed pneumonia and was drifting towards the point of no return . <p> According to Col.

During this phase locals from locked down areas where Covid 19 cases were detected will be quarantined . Nearly 2,500 such cases are currently being quarantined in 20 centres , developed and manned by the Tri Forces . Among them are 1,200 people from Bandaranayakapura and 300 from Maradana . " In low dense areas like Atalugama in Bandaragama the village can be locked down and people can be allowed to self-quarantine but in high dense areas such as Bandaranayakapura , the people must be quarantined in centres for it to be effective , " Col.

Only 21% of New Yorkers tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in recently administered semi-random antibody tests . The dumb media was kind of surprised by this news . One Bloomberg article said the following : <p> " ... the preliminary results appear to confirm predictions that the virus has infected far more people than New York has been able to diagnose . It also means that the fatality rate is likely lower than implied by merely examining confirmed cases and deaths . " <p> Duh ! My 10-year old son is smarter than these journalists who have been mindlessly reporting the " confirmed " case count as if they really indicate the actual extent of COVID-19 infections . He tells me that in our town there must have been at least 1100 people infected with the virus because the death toll stands at 11 . Yet , these journalists still could n't get their heads wrapped around the fact that infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is calculated by dividing the current death count by current confirmed number of cases . <p> Before proceeding further , you have to read this article I wrote more than a month ago . You wo n't appreciate my current predictions without reading that article . <p> Let 's stay one step ahead of mainstream journalists and give you the latest facts about the coronavirus . <p> The COVID-19 death toll in New York State currently stands at 21000 . This is actually a " minimum " for the actual number of COVID-19 deaths in NYS . The correct figure is probably closer to 25000 as a large percentage of non-hospital COVID-19 deaths were gone uncounted in New York State and elsewhere . <p> Once you contract COVID-19 it may take you up to 12 weeks to die or recover . So , we are certain that the number of COVID-19 deaths in NYS will continue to increase through the end of June . We are probably 70-75% done which implies that the death toll in NYS will settle around 32,000 . <p> The figures estimated by Governor Cuomo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 based on the first batch of samples collected . Since it takes up to 14 days for antibodies to develop , I believe this 13.9% figure will creep up towards 17-18% range as they keep collecting samples over the next few weeks . <p> We also do n't know the ratio of false positives and false negatives in New York State 's antibody tests , but it is likely that the percentage of false negatives is much larger than the percentage of false positives . <p> Overall , it looks like the number of total infections in New York State as of today will be around 3.2 million . This tells me that COVID-19 's infection fatality rate is around 1% ( 32K deaths for 3.2 million infections ) . It could be 20% more or less than the 1% figure , depending on where the actual figures end up . However , I think 1% is a nice round estimate that 's very close to the actual infection fatality rate . <p> Now that we have a very robust IFR estimate , we can calculate the IFR for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details ( email me if you 'd have any questions about the methodology ) , here are the results : <p> As you can see from these estimates , COVID-19 is much deadlier than the seasonal flu for people above the age of 40 . <p> What 's the smartest way to reopen New York City ? <p> We know that COVID-19 's IFR is 1% . Current US death toll is near its peak and stands at 50K . This means as we go down the hill , the number of US deaths will reach 100K . This also means there are around 10 million Americans who are infected with the new coronavirus . <p> So far we sucked at testing , tracing , and isolating infected people . That 's why we were forced to implement statewide " stay at home " orders . We also suck at the implementation of " stay at home " orders . Georgia is planning to lift a large chunk of its restrictions today . Other states will follow soon .

Since the hospitalization rate is around 5% and it takes about 10-14 days to get hospitalized , we can estimate that there were 4000 newly infected people in New York City on April 10th . And that was in the middle of a lockdown . <p> I do n't think we are going to have the political determination in most states in this country to reduce the number of actively infected and contagious people down to manageable levels . This requires at least another 4-6 weeks of strict nationwide lockdowns , and desperate people are already protesting against lockdowns . The number of job losses already exceeded 26% and our GDP is on its way to register double digit declines . We even experienced negative oil prices which crashed the United States Oil Fund , LP ( NYSE:USO ) . Even though the S&amp;P 500 Index is down only around 13% year-to-date , that 's mostly because of bailouts and trillions of stimulus spending pumped into the system . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our next best strategy is mitigation and herd immunity . For herd immunity we probably need around 50-60% of New Yorkers infected with the virus . Currently 21% of New Yorkers are already infected . This figure is probably closer to 25% for the reasons I explained above . <p> Nearly 53% of New Yorkers are under the age of 40 . We can allow these younger New Yorkers to go back to their normal lives , get infected , and get closer to developing herd immunity . Obviously , " going back to normal " has to be optional for people under the age of 40 . These people accounted for only 2% of deaths in New York State . Even if all of them are infected at the same time and hospitalized at the same time , this wo n't restrain our healthcare system in any significant way . <p> Around 25% of the people above the age of 40 are already infected with the new coronavirus . Assuming that they are immune to the virus or they will likely survive a second infection , we can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Overall , nearly 60% of New Yorkers can resume their lives and the rest should have the option to isolate themselves until herd immunity or a viable treatment option is developed . <p> Herd Immunity For The Rest Of The Country <p> The rest of the country is far from herd immunity . Nevertheless , they can follow the same strategy of returning people under the age of 40 back to their " normal " lives . This will build a wall of immunity against the spread of the coronavirus in October and November . <p> Our estimates show that only about 2-3% of the rest of the United States is infected with COVID-19 . If we can bring this figure to 20-30% throughout the summer by letting younger people contract the virus and build immunity , we might be able to reduce its R0 below 1 in September by employing an aggressive test-trace-isolate strategy .

It 's gruelling stuff . Take this paragraph opener : <p> " Michelle wakes hungry . No lunch yesterday , no tea . The pillow her face is on stinks . The mattress feels sunk and damp like the cupped palm of somebody 's sweaty hand . She rolls onto her side and air shifts up from under the duvet . She stinks too .

When Michelle inevitably , tragically , returns to the pokie machines , convincing herself this is how to make the most of what little money she has , Dukes captures the thrill of winning and losing that comes from this kind of gambling . It 's like reading a report of the most depressing heist ever : <p> " She looks at the flashing jacks then presses GAMBLE , setting a single playing card whirling against a glittering black background , blinking first hearts and then clubs .

He is also juggling being a new father , and his wife returning to work . He 's struggling with the idea of being a care worker and while it 's never explicitly stated in the story , there 's the clear implication that he sees this as a feminine , emasculating role . <p> He says , to himself , towards the end of the story : " Could this be his job ?

" <p> As of Sunday , 150 juveniles and 283 staff had tested positive for COVID-19 at facilities nationwide , according to an unofficial log being kept by Josh Rovner at the Washington DC-based nonprofit The Sentencing Project .

" They are in self-preservation mode .

But on April 17 , it revealed that more than two dozen kids had tested positive at the Bon Air Juvenile Correctional Center outside Richmond , accounting for a quarter of all reported cases at youth facilities nationwide at that time , according to The Sentencing Project .

Although they are supposed to receive one hour per day outside their rooms , this is not always honored , " the letter said .

In his wallet , he carries a letter that explains to law enforcement or anyone else who might ask why he continues to work each day when others shelter at home . Drafted by his employer , the document cites President Donald Trump , who on March 16 found food-processing workers to bear a " special responsibility " to maintain their normal schedules during this national emergency . <p> In the days that followed this announcement , Corral and his colleagues performed this frontline duty largely without what are now deemed to be basic workplace protections to reduce the risk of COVID-19 , the illness caused by the novel coronavirus . Not until April did the plant require the wearing of face masks and erect plexiglass barriers between line workers and more recently in dining areas , among other safety measures .

Nationally , an investigation by USA Today and the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting found 3,400 confirmed COVID-19 infections at 62 plants that had resulted in at least 17 worker deaths . <p> As protesters rally in Washington and other states to pressure governors to open more businesses , meat processors have been under pressures in some communities where they operate to temporarily close . <p> Advertising <p> They also are facing scrutiny for their market conduct .

In an April 6 letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue , Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer requested that an ongoing federal investigation of beef pricing margins be expanded to look for market manipulations or other signs of unfair practices during the pandemic . <p> Still , the COVID-19 outbreaks also are taking a financial toll on processors .

Today , the 39-year-old worker earns nearly $19 an hour with benefits that include a month of paid vacation . <p> For years , this Wallula plant has been one of the largest employers in Walla Walla County , and has offered immigrants from many different countries a place to draw a steady paycheck .

The facility , during normal operations , processes enough beef each day to feed 4 million people , according to the company . And Corral takes pride in his support of that effort . <p> Advertising <p> " I do n't want to have a shortage of food later , " he said . " That 's my motivation .

@@31812341 <h> Even the Ritual of ' Jeopardy ! ' Has Been Interrupted by the Coronavirus <p> Since 1984 , ' Jeopardy ! ' has aired new episodes five nights a week for 11 months out of the year . But in June , the show will run out of pre-taped episodes a month ahead of schedule . How has the program 's fan base reacted to the disruption of a television cornerstone ? <h> Share this story <p> You might assume that Jeopardy ! fans are a sedate group . Jeopardy ! is a show , after all , that takes pains never to refer to the two nonwinning contestants as the episode 's losers , whose acolytes pride themselves on knowledge of the Civil War and Central Asian capitals and spend their evenings , yes , watching a game show . The show 's fans are thus surely kind and placid souls , probably with a bowl of strawberry hard candies at the ready . <p> If that 's what you believe , you have clearly never tried to take away a Jeopardy ! fan 's access to Jeopardy ! <p> These are strange times , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment . Jeopardy ! is no exception : After a brief attempt to tape without a studio audience , the show was forced to shutter its studio . Because the show tapes five episodes on each filming day and records them well in advance , it banked enough new episodes to get through the middle of June -- a cutoff extended by the show 's announcement last week that it would air a couple of weeks of reruns in May . But then , barring a return to the studio before that point , Jeopardy ! will be unable to provide its biggest fans with new material a full month and a half ahead of the planned season finale . <p> And that 's to say nothing of the preemptions . <p> This is a period of breaking news -- of daily or weekly press briefings from the president , governors , mayors , and assorted discomfited scientists . Given these events ' significance , networks have taken to pushing the bulletins of doom and gloom ahead of regularly scheduled programming , including , frequently , Jeopardy ! Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with some affiliates rescheduling the day 's Jeopardy ! episode for later in the evening and others nixing it altogether . <p> " My kid is going to be so upset , " a viewer wrote . " We lost power yesterday and now this . The struggle is so real . " <p> On the Jeopardy ! subreddit , when a user posted a warning for the New York and Philadelphia television markets that their episodes would be preempted by a " Jersey 4 Jersey " benefit concert , a commenter replied , " I live in NJ , I consider myself to be very Jersey , but you fucking give me Bruce and Bon Jovi over Jeopardy and I 'm currently here cursing gabagool and giving my television the finger . " <p> With Jeopardy ! , a rearranged schedule is a more serious problem for would-be viewers than it would be for most shows . There 's no streaming service that receives daily episodes for at-your-leisure viewing , and if an episode never airs , it wo n't even be on your DVR , meaning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to air the week of the September 11 attacks , for example , were preempted in nearly all markets , and went effectively unseen until they were aired by the Game Show Network four years later . <p> I 've been having this reoccurring nightmare : I finally make it to Jeopardy ! as a contestant , and unseat the returning champion-- except it 's an episode that 's pre-empted by a Donald Trump press conference . <p> For many Jeopardy ! fans , the show has long been a source of stability . In an ordinary year , new episodes appear in every month but August , with each new season beginning in September and concluding at the end of the following July . During the 36 seasons and more than 8,000 episodes of its current edition , it has changed exceedingly little , even compared to its game-show peers : Alex Trebek has hosted every episode but one , when he traded places with Pat Sajak of Wheel of Fortune , Jeopardy ! ' s sister show . <p> If Jeopardy ! feels like an anchor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular viewers now . The world might be unrecognizable outside , but five times a week , there 's a fresh chance that Trebek might say the word " genre . " <p> Every morning at 7:30 , Dave Ross watches Jeopardy ! <p> While many Jeopardy ! viewers think of the game show as an evening affair , that 's not the case everywhere . Because the show is syndicated , television stations are free to schedule it whenever they like , and its time slot varies across the country . On some stations , it airs before Wheel of Fortune ; in others , it airs after . According to Matt Carberry , a Jeopardy ! fan who maintains a database of the show 's statistics , just under half of the 210 stations that carry Jeopardy ! air it at either 7 or 7:30 p.m. local . The rest run the gamut : In Chicago , for example , Jeopardy ! airs every day at 3:30 p.m . <p> Montgomery , Alabama , carries the nation 's very earliest airing at 9:30 a.m . CT , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . So for Ross , who lives in Las Vegas and uses a CBS streaming tool set to Montgomery 's affiliate station two hours ahead , that is when he watches , tuning in before he 's even had breakfast and becoming among the very first viewers in the nation to learn the day 's Jeopardy ! outcome . <p> As you 've probably guessed , Ross , 60 , is no normal fan . He is known in Jeopardy ! circles simply as " Jay " -- " Boy , I probably just picked it almost completely at random , " he says of the nickname -- and provides a singular utility to the show 's most diehard followers . Nearly every weekday morning since 2013 , as the Montgomery episode is wrapping up , Ross has published a recap online , breaking the news to the world of the day 's new champion . <p> Spoilers on a show like Jeopardy ! , where a staid middle manager winning a few games would count as big news in many months , are admittedly something of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't actually trying to ruin the result for those hoping to learn it on their own later in the day : His recaps , which he posts to a handful of Jeopardy ! haunts , including the show 's fan-run subreddit , sit safely behind a warning about their contents , where only those seeking a spoiler might see them . His ambitions are , well , grander . " I 'm essentially looking for some of the aspects of the show that the show itself never discusses , " he says . <p> Those aspects principally include wagering -- how much a player risked on a Daily Double or in Final Jeopardy , where they stood among their opponents at the time , and how it worked out for them . Ross views his analyses as potential educational tools for future contestants . <p> " This recap -- one of the goals of it is to get people to think while they 're watching the show , what would I and what should I do in that situation , " says Ross , " so that when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like such a mystery . They 'll be ready . " <p> The recaps first began in the comment section of The A.V. Club , which at the time was known for its active commenter community . " Somebody at one point suggested at the beginning of a Jeopardy ! season that somebody should recap Jeopardy ! , " remembers Ross . " I said , ' Well , that 's a good idea . I 'm qualified to do that . ' So I just started doing it . " There is , says Ross , precisely no money in it . <p> Ross was scheduled to audition for Jeopardy ! in Las Vegas this spring , only to have the event canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic . He says that the show made some sort of accommodation this month , but on this -- and on whether he is now in the contestant pool , and thus a candidate to appear on the show once taping resumes -- he is mum . <p> Ross has been watching Jeopardy ! nearly all his life . Now retired after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home for lunch during elementary school and watching the original Art Fleming -- hosted version of the show , which aired on NBC at noon . " It 's been something I 've dealt with practically forever , " he says . <p> He keeps an eye on the replies to his recaps , so while his early-morning Montgomery episodes have been safe from preemptions so far , he 's well aware that that is not the case for much of the country . " Boy , people really do n't like that , " he says . <p> " They can hear about what 's going on in the world like from a lot of places , " he says , " but there 's only one place they 're getting their Jeopardy ! , and they do n't want anybody messing around with it .

@@41886241 <p> The current political emphasis on ' the experts ' is partly a depoliticisation and blame deflection strategy to render them , instead of the politicians , as the public face of the coronavirus crisis , write Matthew Flinders and Gergana Dimova . <p> ' People in this country have had enough of experts , ' Michael Gove ( in ) famously declared as part of the assault on ' the establishment ' and ' elites ' that formed such a central element of the Leave campaign and Brexit . And yet now many key members of that campaign seemed to have adopted a very different strategic position . Instead of deriding and distancing the experts , the government is now hugging them close . <p> The frailties of evidence-based policy , or what is now more often termed ' evidence-led ' policy , have been well-documented within the social sciences . The rational , technocratic , data-driven recommendations of the scientists will at some point fall upon the procrustean realities of frequently irrational and commonly dysfunctional political life . And yet one of the defining performative elements of the coronavirus crisis is the daily reports of the Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figuratively and literally by ' the experts ' . No message , statement or utterance can be made by a representative of the government without being foreshadowed and subsequently enmeshed within the golden phrase that is ' following the expert advice we are receiving ' . <p> In some countries a new public service bargain seems to have emerged whereby the politicians depart the stage to an almost total extent and let the experts become the public face of the crisis . Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States , Fernando Sim ? n , the head of health emergency centre in Spain , Christian Drosten , the head of virology at Charit ? hospital in Germany and J ? r ? me Salomon , head of the national health authority in France have emerged as some of the most visible faces of the response to the pandemic . It 's ' the experts ' that are now the household names . <p> So how can we understand this sudden shift from loathing the experts to loving them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to this question is refreshingly simple . The pandemic is a toxic issue for all politicians : not just in the sense of the epidemiology of the crisis and its public health implications but also because the nature of politics means that at the end of the day someone will be scapegoated and blamed for the crisis . Scapegoating , finger-pointing , arse-covering and the emergence of blame games ( and blame boomerangs ) are one of the few predictions that anyone can make about the current crisis with any certainty . <p> From appearing as external annoyances offering unhelpful facts as they did to those promoting leaving the European Union , the experts now offer political cover . That is , potentially the most beautiful blame-shifting political bullet-catching safety net ever built around today 's politicians but like spiders building a web the beauty veils a deeper predatory aspect . Bringing in the experts and hugging them close is a politicized form of self-preservation strategy that might ( and it is a rather dubious ' might ' ) afford politicians some distance from direct culpability when things go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with crises demands an agility , speed and ambition that public bureaucracies are generally not designed to deliver . Decisions will have to be taken on the basis of imperfect information , in an emotional context , by exhausted individuals who are well aware they are dealing with matters of life and death . Politics is a brutal game . It 's not for the faint-hearted and at some point every politician and official knows that they will have to provide an account of each and every decision they made . And yet post-crisis accountability and scrutiny frameworks are rarely concerned with lesson-learning and a balanced review of the facts , and are more accurately viewed as blame-allocation processes where ' gotcha ! ' is the favorite phrase and scalp-hunting the favourite game . <p> The contemporary visibility and political emphasis on ' the experts ' is therefore a double-edged sword .

@@41886641 <h> Prihatin not reaching women in high-risk groups <h> Share this article <p> MANY women will fall through the cracks of the recently announced stimulus package , which fails to account for those most exposed to the fallout from the Covid-19 outbreak . <p> The scope of the stimulus package must be widened to meet the needs of those individuals most susceptible to losing their livelihoods , including female-headed households , domestic violence survivors , women workers in vulnerable employment , and at-risk non-citizens living in Malaysia . <p> Existing programmes either exclude altogether these segments of society , or are poorly calibrated to meet the specific needs of these groups . We are living through extraordinary times , and this demands a divergence from the status quo . We call for the government to fine tune its policies to address the following areas of concern : <p> Extend the wage subsidies programme to women in vulnerable employment <p> Ensure the poor , especially at-risk women , have access to cash transfers if they do n't qualify for the Bantuan Prihatin Nasional ( BPN ) scheme <p> Provide additional relief so that withdrawals from Employees Provident Fund ( EPF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lower for women workers , are used only as a last resort <p> Ensure access to relief for non-citizens in need , including foreign wives who are domestic violence survivors <p> Private sector to be encouraged to fund these initiatives <p> Design a social safety net that empowers at-risk women <p> Government must extend the wage subsidies programme to women in vulnerable employment <p> The most critical component of the Prihatin package for workers is the wage subsidy policy . For firms suffering losses of more than 50% , the government will subsidise a monthly wage of RM600 per employee whose earnings are below RM4,000 . <p> This wage subsidy policy narrowly targets workers in formal employment , ignoring a substantial segment of individuals in vulnerable employment , including the self-employed , informal workers , and unpaid family workers , who are disproportionately women . Over a quarter of working women -- 25.88% -- fall under this category of vulnerable employment , as compared to the 20.9% of the male labour force in this category . The effects of the discrepancy in the types of work undertaken by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the current pandemic . <p> The penalisation of women in vulnerable employment is even more evident in light of the proposal to provide RM500 transfers to 120,000 e-hailing drivers , who are predominantly self-employed men . By contrast , transfers to other impacted self-employed individuals , such as cleaners or those providing childcare or catering services on a freelance basis -- who tend to be women -- are not accounted for under the stimulus package . <p> Policymakers need to recognise that these socioeconomic effects also intersect with other forms of vulnerabilities . For a single female-headed household , a loss in self-employment income spells disaster for the entire household , including children . For domestic violence survivors , an income loss will leave them totally dependent on the abuser in households already suffering from stark gender inequalities . <p> Government must ensure the poor , especially women at-risk , have access to cash transfers if they do n't qualify for the BPN scheme <p> A recent poll of 20 former residents of WAO 's shelter found that 70% of the women have suffered a loss of income during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of income . Overall , Malaysian women are more likely to be unemployed than men , and the current crisis will exacerbate the gap . <p> Despite this , many of these women wo n't have access to the proposed BPN cash transfers for B40 and M40 households . For B40 households already covered by the Bantuan Sara Hidup programme , the cash transfers will directly be transferred into a representative 's bank account , usually the male head of household . The same applies to M40 households whose bank accounts are registered with the Inland Revenue Board ( IRB ) . <p> Direct transfers to the male head of household will greatly disadvantage domestic violence survivors ; for example , survivors who are in the process of obtaining a divorce from their abusive husband and who can not yet classify themselves as single will not receive anything . Similarly , many women still living in abusive situations and who lack access to joint financial resources wo n't receive the benefit of a direct transfer made to their husbands ' bank accounts ; this is particularly troublesome during the MCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with abusers and may not have the economic independence needed to leave . <p> In order to ensure that the cash transfer programme reaches those most in need -- including female heads of household , domestic violence survivors , and women in poor and rural households -- we recommend the government expand access to these transfers in a number of ways , including by allowing women who would otherwise be ineligible to apply for the benefit outside of existing programmes with a supporting letter from a gazetted shelter or other designated organisation . Additionally , we implore the government to implement other measures to ensure benefits are accessible to women in need -- such as designing the application process to make it clear to applicants that either adult qualifies as the household representative -- to improve the financial access to women most in need . <p> Government must ensure they are providing adequate relief so that withdrawals from EPF savings , which cover a narrow working population and are lower for women , are used only as a last resort <p> Under the I-Lestari programme , EPF contributors ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw up to RM500 from Account 2 for the next 12 months , amounting to RM6,000 in total . <p> However , WAO is concerned that only a very small working population qualifies under this policy , comprising 4.9 million active male EPF contributors and even more narrowly , 3.3 million active female EPF contributors . Together , this covers only 54% of our labour force , leaving a sizeable minority behind . <p> In terms of total savings , 26.51% of these active female contributors and 25.05% of the male contributors have less than RM10,000 in their EPF accounts . As this lower income group is most likely to rely on i-Lestari , a withdrawal of RM6,000 effectively depletes 60% of all pension savings for a quarter of all active EPF contributors . <p> Given the reality of the i-Lestari 's limited coverage , and already tightened household financial conditions , WAO would like to emphasise that adequate alternative relief must be provided so that individuals currently facing income reduction or instability -- especially female heads of household , domestic violence survivors , and other groups of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a low level of EPF savings . <p> Government must ensure access to relief for non-citizens in need , including foreign wives who are domestic violence survivors <p> Currently , the relief measures in the government 's stimulus package are available only to Malaysians . The government must make some provisions for non-citizens in need , such as the foreign wives of Malaysian men who are domestic violence survivors . Such an individual -- despite in some cases having been in the country for many years and having Malaysian children -- would not be entitled to direct payments . <p> Similarly , female foreign workers may be facing disruption or uncertainty in their employment and may additionally face higher risks of abuse , without having any access to economic relief that could be critical for them . <p> The government should supplement the existing stimulus measures with additional relief for foreign citizens in need , which could be administered through designated organisations . <p> WAO is more than willing to play our part <p> Apart from continuing to care for women in need , WAO is also looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender equality in organisations . We aim to roll this out to GLCs and corporates , which will pay a fee out of their training budget . All fees earned will go towards strengthening our programmes to support women and children in need . <p> Private sector to partially fund these initiatives <p> Apart from using the resources available to the government , another channel that should be tapped is the private sector . There are organisations which are flourishing during the pandemic and are in a position to assist in this time of need . Tax incentives can be extended to individuals or organisations who contribute cash towards women in need as short term relief as well as provide employment opportunities for long-term financial sustenance . <p> Now is the time to design a social safety net that empowers women most at risk <p> The gender-bias embedded in the current stimulus package is extremely concerning . WAO recommends that the government strengthen the stimulus package through additional measures that reach the most at-risk , regardless of one 's current employment status and taking into account the lived realities faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic violence survivors . <p> It is the people who have the least who need the most help . They are the ones who live from hand-to-mouth even during normal times . And who now stand to be bereft of even basic necessities -- food and shelter . We have never been a nation to turn our back on those in need . <p> We should use this opportunity to implement a longer-term social safety net that accounts for and empowers often-overlooked segments of society . Only a non-discriminatory , gender-inclusive stimulus package will allow our society to emerge intact , perhaps even stronger , from this crisis . -- April 3 , 2020 . <p> * Women 's Aid Organisation is a civil society group fighting for women 's rights and specifically against violence against women . <p> * This is the opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of The Malaysian Insight .

Despite its relative liquidity , the pound was one of the G10 currencies most harshly punished by the dollar funding squeeze , possibly due to the UK 's large financial sector .

@@41888541 <h> Sophie , Countess of Wessex , Is the Royal Family 's Secret Weapon <p> It is a rainy afternoon in November 2019 and a group of around 25 women have gathered in a conference center near London 's Kings Cross station . Cups of tea and pieces of cake are being served and there is a buzz of chatter and laughter . They are there to talk about their work , but the light-hearted atmosphere belies the seriousness of the roles they perform . <p> They are members of the Women Mediators across the Commonwealth , a network of women on the frontlines of peacebuilding across 20 countries . Many are victims of conflict themselves , and some continue to face threats to their lives . But on that particular day there is a sense of positivity and hope as they discuss their experiences with Sophie , Countess of Wessex . <p> Sophie , who married Queen Elizabeth 's youngest son Edward in 1999 , has taken up the cause of women 's empowerment as a central part of her royal work . On International Women 's Day 2019 -- the same day that the eyes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Sophie stood up in Buckingham Palace and made a pledge . Promising to do all she could to help survivors of sexual violence in conflict and champion the international Women , Peace and Security agenda , she said : " As someone who firmly believes in the equality of men and women , I feel drawn to your cause and to do what I can to help raise further awareness . " <p> Photo credit : Tim Graham - Getty Images <p> Even in the grand and imposing setting , the Countess did not shy away from the brutal realities of her subject . She recalled meeting Nobel Peace Laureate Dr. Denis Mukwege : There is " nothing like speaking to someone , who as a gynecologist , has treated hundreds of victims of the kinds of rape and abuse that defies belief , " she said . " Dr Mukwege painstakingly stitches these women back together and does what he can to care for them . It is so desperately sad therefore , that many of them end up back at his clinic only months later . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sophie has taken her message to New York , India , Lebanon , Kenya , Kosovo , Oslo , Sierra Leone , Munich , and South Sudan . During a visit to Juba , South Sudan for International Women 's Day 2020 she said , " My message to the men is to encourage you all to listen to your women folk and to support them to take their place at your side . " <p> Her work does not regularly receive the kind of media attention that the younger royals command , but Sophie , now 55 , has become a stalwart member of the " firm . " Her husband is far down the pecking order at 11th in line to the throne , but the Wessexes are two of just a handful of full-time working royals . And the spotlight on Sophie has intensified in the vacuum left as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle step back . <p> When the coronavirus pandemic gripped the UK , the Queen told the nation : " You can be assured that my family and I stand ready to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wessexes ' efforts played a key role . Sophie 's 16-year-old daughter Lady Louise filmed her from inside their home for a video pointing parents and carers in the direction of helpful resources . <p> Photo credit : Max Mumby/Indigo - Getty Images <p> And when Britain took part in its first Clap for our Carers initiative to honor those on the front lines fighting the virus , the Wessexes released a video of the whole family joining in . <p> Just yesterday Sophie released a message on social media to women peacebuilders , activists , and survivors of conflict-related sexual violence . <p> As well as joining a conference call with @whatthewomensay The Countess also sent a video message to support Women Peace Builders and Survivors and Advocates against Conflict Related Sexual Violence . **26;937;TOOLONG <p> She began with " To my friends " and went onto say : " As we all grapple with the coronavirus pandemic I wish to dedicate a few thoughts to you . " She continued : " I know that your bravery , creativity , problem-solving skills and empathy will be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the words : " I stand with you all , now and always . " <p> Like all royals , the Countess is now getting used to working remotely , contacting her charities via video chat and telephone . She is patron of more than 70 organizations and carries out approximately 240 engagements each year . As well as focussing on women and girls globally , she also has a strong interest in agriculture and raising awareness about preventable blindness . <p> Sophie 's low-key approach to duties pre-dates her willingness to hop on video calls ; she is known to surprise her hosts by driving herself to and from engagements , waving goodbye from behind the wheel of her own car . <p> " She actually presents herself as an ordinary person and I think that is increasingly what the royal family needs to do , " says Amanda Pullinger , CEO of 100 Women in Finance , an organization which Sophie champions . <p> " The Countess is one of the unsung members of the royal family and in fact she 's been working on quite gritty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello ! Royal Editor Emily Nash tells T&amp;C . She adds that Sophie is " very well-liked " and that the Queen is " particularly fond of " her . <p> Indeed , Sophie is often chosen to accompany the monarch by car to church at Sandringham on Christmas morning while other members of the family walk . In a speech at Buckingham Palace in October 2019 to celebrate the Queen 's Diamond Jubilee Trust , she called the Queen " Mama " and told her she has been " so proud to share with you the work I have witnessed being carried out . " <p> Gender equality may be high on the Countess 's agenda in part because she had a career of her own before marrying into the royal family . Sophie Rhys-Jones began dating her prince in 1993 while working in public relations and she went on to set up her own company . In an episode that demonstrates the difficulty of combining royal life with other work , she stepped down in 2001 after being secretly recorded by a tabloid making indiscrete remarks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work after that . In 2003 -- the same year her daughter was born -- she started the Women in Business Committee for the Duke of Edinburgh 's Award , which helped the prominent royal charity to reach more people . In 2014 , she launched the organization 's Women 's Network Forum , which brings together leaders in the workplace to promote gender balance and equality . <p> " Despite making giant strides forward since my mother 's generation and even current working generations many women in this country still face discrimination , sexism and inequality on a daily basis , " Sophie said in a speech this January before female students from secondary schools across London . " Your generation I hope will make even greater strides towards gender equality than we have and , believe me , we need you to . " <p> Sitting down with the girls afterwards , she listened to their hopes for their careers . " I 've sat at a number of tables and listened to her interact with young people . She 's fantastic , " said Pullinger of 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , gives them incredibly good advice -- she 's got a teenage daughter herself . She actually asks incredibly smart questions and it really does reflect the fact that she had a professional life before she became a royal . " <p> Photo credit : Max Mumby/Indigo - Getty Images <p> Pullinger also notes Sophie 's candor . " It 's interesting -- she 's not nicey nicey . Of course she 's polite , but she 'll tell you what she thinks . If she disagrees she 'll say , and she 's done it to me a number of times . And I think that 's fantastic . I think she 's somebody who 's gained a lot of confidence in this area . " <p> Another area of royal life where Sophie 's past career is useful is an intuitive understanding of what the media needs to best highlight causes she cares about . " She was a PR all those years ago so I think she 's very aware of the value of a picture , " says royal photographer for Shutterstock Editorial , Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras and quite accommodating . She does n't pose but she will always be aware of what we need and make sure we get it . " <p> Rooke adds that while pictures of Sophie do n't automatically make their way into the newspapers in the same way an image of the Cambridges or Sussexes might , there is a steady demand for her work . " I think there 's more interest in her now , " he says . <p> Photo credit : Mark Cuthbert - Getty Images <p> Photographers like Rooke also enjoy covering Sophie because her engagements are usually more intimate . He describes being on her overseas visits as a " much more pleasant " experience than busier royal tours . " You 're almost part of the team . " <p> As well as championing her charities , Sophie supports the Queen by carrying out regular engagements across the UK . During a day trip to Oxfordshire in November she visited the Sylva Wood Centre and tried her hand at wood " planing , " cheerily answering " I 'm both " whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive was that she was ambidextrous , " said Joe Bray , head of the Wood School , after he showed her how to use the equipment in both directions . The same day , Sophie sat on the floor playing with children at the Footsteps Foundation , which provides therapy for children with neurological disorders . <p> Amanda Pullinger notes how the Countess is " thoughtful " about how she dresses when meeting young people , choosing outfits that make her " approachable . " Of course , she also plays her part during lavish royal events in ballgowns and tiaras . Emily Nash describes her as a " fantastic style ambassador for the UK and for British labels in particular , " adding " our readers love details on what she 's wearing . " <p> There has been much made of whether there is a " plan " to make Sophie more prominent now Harry and Meghan have stepped back , but the reality is that the Countess has been steadily playing her part for more than 20 years . And it is her sincerity as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really genuinely with women peacebuilders . It 's not just cosmetic , " one peacebuilder from Sri Lanka told T&amp;C . <p> " I 'm poised to continue because I see her coming towards me , " said Esther Omam , who has worked on development issues in Cameroon for almost 20 years . " When I go back home I will keep her image in my heart , knowing that some way the Countess came to us , gave us encouraging words and promised to support our work . "

@@41893241 <p> Besides the widespread and persistent domestic economic shock , as in the great influenza pandemic , the coronavirus crisis is occurring in a highly interconnected global economy , with China and other critical nerve centres of the world trade largely or wholly disabled . <p> The coronavirus shock is beginning to deflate an enormous credit bubble , which was likely to burst in any case . The longer the ongoing stress continues , the more severe the eventual debt crises will be . <p> Policy authorities have responded quickly to prevent the economic and financial crisis from snowballing . But the crisis could run ahead of the policy effort . <p> The eurozone is particularly vulnerable because its member nations depend heavily on trade and they have extremely large debt ratios . Italy is the weakest link economically , financially , and politically . And eurozone members nations face multiple financial and political constraints in mounting an appropriately sized cooperative counter to the crisis . <h> The economic crisis is worrisome because it has disabled global trade nodes <p> The coronavirus struck China , the world 's central trade node , in the midst of an ongoing Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the start of 2018 . On top of that , the U.S.-China trade war caused world trade to contract in the final months of 2019 . On that preexisting weakness , the virus inflicted a hammer blow . Chinese trade collapsed . World trade numbers , when they come in , will look ugly . <h> Europe 's increasing trade dependence on China . <p> As a result , whenever the Chinese economy has slowed in recent years , so have the European economies . That link was plainly evident during the 2018-2019 slowdown.Source : IMF Data <h> By late last year , falling world trade had pulled Europe into near recession . <p> ( Annual growth rate , per cent ) <p> Now with the sharp Chinese contraction , European countries are being hit twice . Their direct trade with China is shrinking and the knock-on effect of slower European growth is causing them to import less from each other . This China factor -- coupled with the severe domestic economic shock -- could cause deep damage to Italy , in the same way a disease attacks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coma since joining the eurozone in 1999 , and it was in another recession when the coronavirus struck . <p> China itself appears to have contained new infections and deaths . And reports suggest that some Chinese factories have resumed operation . However , increased Chinese activity is not yet evident in financial markets . The Australian dollar , which appreciates visibly when China expands , is still testing the lows . <p> Moreover , even when China tries to normalise production , other countries must be ready to buy and sell . If , as now appears , the crisis will persist longer in Europe , China 's ability to pump up its own and global growth will remain constrained . Meanwhile , emerging markets -- Argentina , Brazil , Mexico , Turkey -- are also financially stressed as foreign capital is fleeing to the relative safety of U.S. dollar assets . For these reasons , restoring the global trade network and , hence , global recovery will take time . The prospect of a bounce back later this year , as many forecasters had hoped -- and continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking note <p> The first impact of the economic crisis was on stock markets . In that initial assessment , stock markets recognised that Italy would be hardest hit . <h> Stock markets took a bleak view of Italian economic prospects <p> ( February 18 , 2020 = 100 ) <p> However , though stock indices were in free fall , there was initially no financial crisis . But danger lurked in the global credit bubble that had reached a dangerous peak . According to the Washington-based Institute of International Finance , the global debt outstanding doubled from ? 97bn ( $120bn ) in 2006 to ? 195bn ( $240bn ) in 2019 , reaching 320 per cent of world GDP . Every country and every type of borrower took advantage of the low interest rates to gorge on debt . Debt ratios rose especially for corporates and governments , and while the ratios for banks in advanced economies declined , they remained higher than those for other types of borrowers . <p> In the second week of March , once the economic threat of the coronavirus became clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , and are , relatively modest compared to levels observed during the most intense phase of the global financial crisis between July 2007 and May 2009 . Remember though that in that crisis financial tensions rolled mercilessly across various credit markets . As the epicenter of the crisis shifted to the eurozone , the cost of credit to companies , banks , and governments rose sharply . <p> There is reason to worry that the visible credit market tensions will increase and spread . Generally , financial crises are severe not just when outstanding debt burdens are high but , potentially more acutely , when growth slows down rapidly , making it hard to repay that debt . Today , with a sharp decline in output and high debt burdens a question mark hangs over the ability of borrowers to repay the that debt . <h> Policymakers responded energetically <p> The Fed set the ball rolling by lowering interest rates ( by reducing its policy rate and renewing bond purchases ) , injecting liquidity into the U.S. banking system and making dollar liquidity available to several central banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unlimited amounts , while backstopping other credit markets . The Bank of England took actions to lower rates and provide liquidity . The European Central Bank ( ECB ) has not reduced its policy rate but expanded its bond purchases to around a trillion euros for the rest of this year and added liquidity into eurozone banks . <p> These are important actions in a conventional financial crisis but , in the current context , plasters for a trauma patient . As long as spending is constrained by physical limits on movements and by the shutdown of factories and services to contain the virus , lower interest rates can not help . Liquidity into banks supports ongoing operations ; it does not spur new activity . <p> Fiscal measures , properly targeted , could be more effective . On March 20 , the Chancellor Rishi Sunak set the benchmark with a bold promise : ' Government grants will cover 80 per cent of the salary of retained workers up to a total of ? 2,500 a month . ' He promised unlimited interest free loans for 12 months to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants . Such economic life support is crucial to sustain those who are losing their livelihoods and need to pay for food , utilities , and mortgages . Other targeted help -- such as more generous family leave -- will also provide a critical safety net . In Europe , Germany , with an immediate injection of about 4.5 per cent of GDP and other support has , so far , the most aggressive stimulus . The U.S. , as with monetary policy , has the largest fiscal stimulus of around 9 per cent of GDP . <p> In a second phase , once the worst of the virus contagion is behind us but when financial stress , even a debt default crisis , is still with us , a more generalised spending stimulus will help boost the economy through spending multipliers and by instilling greater optimism . <p> But there is an immediate task at hand . Borrowers will soon begin defaulting on their loans , creating a new set of challenges for policymakers . The question , at its core , will be : how will the losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written down , or will debtors be allowed to repay debt over longer periods of time ? <h> Why Europe is so vulnerable <p> European economies entered 2020 in a weak economic condition . Since then the coronavirus hit their domestic economies hard . And because they are enmeshed in global trading relationships , their distress is acute . <p> European financial vulnerabilities are also severe . Government debt-to-GDP ratios in major eurozone nations -- other than Germany -- are near historical highs . European banks are fragile . While the banks ' non-performing loans are down , their profitability is low . The market-to-book value ( MBV ) ratios of major European banks were below one before the coronavirus peaked . With the virus , the market 's assessment became bleaker . MBV ratios fell sharply . Germany 's Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank MBV ratios are around 20 per cent . And Deutsche Bank just warned investors it will be ' materially adversely affected ' by the downturn . <p> Each of these European weaknesses is especially acute in Italy : prior economic infirmity , size of the coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domestic banking system . The Italian government owes about ? 2 trillion ( ? 2.3 trillion ) , or 135 per cent of GDP . Italian banks have assets with a paper worth of about ? 4.4 trillion ( ? 5 trillion ) . The true worth of the banks ' assets is likely lower and will fall further as the economy struggles in coming quarters . Italy 's Monte de Paschi bank has non-performing loans of about 17 per cent of its assets . Even the strongest banks -- UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo -- have MBV ratios significantly below one . <h> Treacherous moments -- and terrible choices -- lie ahead for Europe <p> Eurozone governments can not fiscally support a prolonged crisis . The German government , with the strongest fiscal position among eurozone members , plans to borrow about ? 307bn ( ? 350bn ) , approximately ten per cent of German GDP . Recapitalising the country 's banks may impose additional demands on the German government . The French and Spanish governments , with debt ratios of around 100 per cent of GDP , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , can increase their budget deficits to 15-20 per cent of GDP before credit markets and rating agencies take fright . But , in addition to protecting themselves , are the Germans fiscally and politically willing and able to aid those unable to spend their way out of this crisis ? <p> Three weeks ago , it seemed to me appropriate for Italy to receive a precautionary credit line , anchored by the eurozone 's bailout fund , the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) . But as the crisis has continued its fearsome course , and now threatens Spain with a financial crisis , the ESM clearly lacks adequate firepower . Moreover , the ESM lends to countries in distress , and Italy and Spain need more than loans . They need sizeable fiscal transfers ( in the hundreds of billions of euros ) , grants of the type built in for states -- although inadequately so -- in the U.S. stimulus package . Grants on this scale are taboo in Europe , where the political discussion is still centred around various alternative lending mechanisms . <p> Eurozone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the day . The ECB could keep buying the Italian government 's debt to prevent a default . But it is not the task of a central bank to deal with insolvencies . Moreover , such an effort would be technically and politically fraught for the ECB , which is not a normal central bank . The ECB is the central banker to a confederation of nations , each of which maintains fiscal sovereignty . If Italy is pushed to the brink , the ECB will struggle to help . The current ECB bond-buying limit of a trillion euros is designated to purchase the bonds of all member states . Italian government debt is over two trillion euros , which will increase further if the government is forced to financially prop up the country 's banks . If Italy is bailed out , other member states on the ECB 's Governing Council will face buying so much Italian debt that the ECB would own Italy . If then , the Italian government is unable to service its debt to the ECB , other member states will face the charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's capital . <p> Alternatively , leaving Italy to fend for herself could cause widespread Italian defaults , triggering defaults by those who have lent to the Italian government and banks . A cascade of defaults would go up the chain to European and global pension and insurance funds , inducing a global financial panic . <p> At this moment of global crisis , the test is going to be whether each nation takes care only of itself or whether the strong help the weak . But will the strong remain strong long enough ?

Below are some techniques for parties to protect themselves in the current crisis . <p> Impact on ongoing negotiations <p> Apart from the instinctive reaction to pause and reflect over the new developments , parties in the midst of negotiations will likely rethink some of the fundamental aspects of the deal , such as : <p> Valuation : Are the historical results of the target still a good benchmark for pricing and will the projections still hold the test of time ? Can the expected post-closing synergies still be achieved ? <p> Binding offer : How binding is an already signed binding offer and can one party discuss the terms or even walk away from the deal ? <p> Timeline : What is now the realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transaction structure : Buying or selling a stake rather than the whole company ? Investing in a different capital instrument ( e.g. convertible bonds ) ? Reducing exposure by acting in partnership , joint venture or consortia ? <p> Security : How to best secure indemnity and warranty claims against potentially insolvent sellers ? How to secure , on the other hand , sellers ' receivables for a retained part of the purchase price at a time when relying on purchasers ' continued liquidity or locking cash in escrow may not be an option ? <p> Impact on the due diligence process <p> Day-to-day business operations have been severely affected by travel bans , social distancing rules , quarantine measures , government-mandated closures and halted factory operations . As a result , on-site inspections and in-person management meetings will become more difficult or impossible . Extensive due diligence is even more important when facing the turbulence created by the COVID-19 pandemic , which has now become a due diligence focus of its own , underlying the more traditional topics . <p> Corporate : Is the target business organised in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supervisory board , shareholders ' meeting ) to function properly despite restrictions related to COVID-19 or even illness of members ? Have recent crisis management decisions been taken in compliance with statutory procedures and director duties ? <p> Finance : Is there a risk of covenant breaches being triggered in financing agreements and how much exposure does this create for the target ( or any insolvency risk ) ? <p> Employment/Regulatory : Has the target complied with all COVID-19 related obligations as an employer ( i.e. information and transparency , alternative working methods such as home office and virtual meetings , additional health and safety measures , GDPR-compliant handling of medical data of employees who have or may have contracted the virus , redundancies only as permitted by law , etc . ) ? What are the legal and operational consequences if it has not ? <p> Material contracts : Is performance under contracts with customers and suppliers still possible in light of the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 ? Are certain customers or suppliers entitled to terminate their contract ? Could the target face damage claims as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Insurance : Would the existing insurance policies cover any losses that have already occurred or may occur as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic ( e.g. losses due to mandatory closures , problems in the supply chain or inability to fulfil own contractual obligations ) ? <p> Others : Have sufficient measures been taken with regards to cybersecurity and trade secrets protection in light of home office / virtual meetings ? Has the target made use of or is it eligible to receive state emergency funding and if so under what conditions ? Does the target have appropriate crisis management policies and contingency plans ? <p> Impact on SPA terms <p> Purchase price : In split signing and closing , buyers are likely to push for a later valuation date , insisting on a closing accounts mechanism , so that interim negative impacts on the business can be captured in the price . Sellers will likely prefer the certainty of a historic pricing point and a locked-box mechanism . Hybrid mechanisms can also be used where the price is set by reference to locked-box accounts , but certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( via net debt adjustment ) and working capital . Adjustments could work either as a two-way euro-for-euro adjustment against an assumed/expected level , or an adjustment to only occur if the minimum assumed/expected level is not met . The closing accounts process provides protection as of closing ( and so only until then ) . As a post-closing protection in case the pandemic has longer term repercussions , buyers could seek deferred consideration provisions , retention of part of the purchase price or an earn-out . Sellers will resist a mechanism that links price to performance post-closing , as they will have limited or no control over the target business after closing . Such structures will be more common in the sale of a majority or minority stake , as the seller retains some influence over the business . Earn-outs may introduce significant pricing uncertainty because of complex adjustments , including to mitigate any adverse impact of choices made by the buyer in crisis times post-closing . <p> Conditions precedent / Long-stop date : Clearances ( e.g. merger control ) , consents or approvals from governmental authorities to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may delay the closing . Dealmakers should generally allow for extra time when setting deadlines for filings or formation of new SPVs , but also consider whether to add provisions for automatic extension of deadlines and/or the long-stop date where the delay is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or measures for its containment . <p> Pre-closing covenants : Pre-closing covenants are essentially about ensuring that the target companies continue their " ordinary course of business " until the time of their handover to the buyer . A question will arise as to what is ordinary in our current times , and how quickly the target company should react to imminent challenges . Obligations to refrain from taking certain actions without the buyer 's approval may conflict with the target 's need to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and limit exposure . Sellers will need an exemption from these covenants to be able to take emergency measures to preserve the business . Buyers will seek an increased involvement in the pre-closing conduct of the business , with the risk of pushing the boundaries of competition law restrictions . Given restrictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for virtual access rights and other online solutions . <p> Warranties and disclosures : While there is no one-size-fits-all solution in M&amp;A deals , it is fairly common for buyers to insist on repetition of seller 's warranties at closing . If repetition will be a default or rather an exception , if there will be specific exclusions related to COVID-19 risks , what will be the value of pre-closing disclosures ? These will be strong negotiation points in forthcoming M&amp;A deals , in conjunction with all other limitations of seller 's warranties typically found in transactions of this type . Buyers may insist on specific representations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic . Sellers may seek a general COVID-19 related exclusion of liability . Ring-fencing ( i.e. if COVID-19 related claims can only be made under specific warranties and not under general warranties such as the accounts warranties ) , the buyer 's knowledge , changes in the law and other limitations will also be relevant . <p> With regards to warranty and indemnity insurance , the expectation is that the underwriting process will include detailed questions on the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis recovery policies and compliance with them . Where satisfactory answers to questions from the underwriters are not provided , or where certain impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are already known risks , there may be exclusions from the insurance coverage . It is possible to see a rise in the key man insurance policies . <p> MAC/MAE : Material Adverse Change ( " MAC " ) clauses have already been in the spotlight after the economic crisis , as many market players understood the significance of sudden changes in the economic circumstances of a deal . Since the COVID-19 outbreak in China , SPAs have cautiously shifted towards more specific MAC clauses , some of them pinpointing the pandemic as a MAC if coupled with a significant disruption of the business or an actual ( as opposed to anticipated future ) financial impact or linked to a specific risk ( like termination of essential contracts ) . While still a negotiation point , we will likely soon witness increased pressure from buyers to negotiate broader MAC clauses . On the other hand , once it becomes an established reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless coupled with extraordinary consequences or to the extent the target business is affected disproportionately to its industry . <p> Obviously , in an agreement signed today , a situation caused by COVID-19 may no longer qualify as a " change " but rather as an " effect " , which may prompt a shift towards Material Adverse Effect ( " MAE " ) clauses . Is the MAE measured on the target business as a whole or by reference to a specific financial metric ( e.g. EBITDA reduction ) or by reference to another KPI ? Is there enough time between signing and closing for the impact to materialise and be measured ? Would it suffice if an event or change has occurred which is " reasonably likely to have " an MAE rather than only where such an event or change has had such an effect before closing ? Are indirect impacts and effects captured if they can be attributed to COVID-19 ? The answers to these questions will be very deal specific . <p> Severability : This standard boilerplate clause could become critical if new legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal or unenforceable . <p> Can a party walk away now on account of the COVID-19 outbreak ? <p> There is no straightforward answer to this question . Once a transaction is closed and money is wired , the intricacies of unwinding the deal are often too complex to even attempt . Hence , we should not expect a high rate of termination claims where the parties have already performed their obligations . <p> For transactions pending closing , or for those where at least part of the payment was deferred , buyers may be more inclined to explore their options . In those circumstances , parties will carefully review clauses dealing with : <p> Material adverse change/effect : Is it purely based on company results or can it relate to the market/industry ? Is it conditioned by long-term effects ? Is it linked to a materiality threshold and can the adverse financial impact be measured at this point ? Are force majeure , natural disasters , epidemics or changes in general economic conditions expressly excluded ? <p> Force majeure : Is it expressly ( and exhaustively ) defined or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there special conditions to claim force majeure , such as a time limit or a certain documentation procedure ? <p> Hardship : Was it expressly excluded to preserve deal certainty or can the general principles of law be relied upon ? Can it lead to termination or just allow the parties to adapt the contract to the new realities ? <p> Termination : Is it still possible or was it expressly excluded ? <p> The COVID-19 pandemic is already causing volatility and uncertainty in global and national markets , making it more challenging to agree to pricing and achieve deal certainty in M&amp;A transactions .

Photo : AFP / The Yomiuri Shimbun <p> With the United States in the throes of a historic public health crisis , President Donald Trump is aiming fire at the institution at the heart of the response -- the World Health Organization . <p> Skeptics see a mercurial US leader eager to find a new scapegoat for the Covid-19 disaster , but even some US supporters of the UN body agree that it made missteps as it took pains not to upset China . <p> Much of the US criticism has been centered personally on the WHO 's director general , Ethiopian microbiologist Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , whose virtual news conferences have become a staple in coverage of the virus that has infected some 1.5 million people worldwide . <p> On Tuesday , as cooped-up people around the world cheered on medical workers for World Health Day , Trump threatened to withhold money from the WHO , of which the United States is the largest funder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote on Twitter . <p> " For some reason , funded largely by the United States , yet very China centric . We will be giving that a good look . " <p> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that the WHO " has n't accomplished what it was intended to deliver " but stopped short of calling for Tedros to step down . <p> Representative Chris Smith , the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on global public health , said Trump was not talking about " defunding , as much as a pause " in WHO support to press for an investigation . <p> " We need answers and the people of the world deserve a WHO that is absolutely transparent , " said Smith , a supporter of robust US aid to fight diseases . <p> " People in my district are dying . People all over the United States and Europe and elsewhere are dying because of what we think was very , very poorly handled , which is probably the most diplomatic way of putting it , " he told AFP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key criticism is how the WHO , quoting Chinese scientists , initially said there was " no clear evidence " of human-to-human transmission of the mysterious virus found late last year in the metropolis of Wuhan . <p> Tedros in late January traveled to China to meet President Xi Jinping and praised Beijing 's " transparency " and cooperation with the WHO . <p> Smith said the WHO should have been " dogged " at a time that China was muzzling doctors including Li Wenliang , a Covid-19 whistleblower who later died of the disease . <p> " When they accepted the Chinese government 's line that there was no human-to-human transmission , there were people in Wuhan who were paying a terrible price for speaking truth to power , " Smith said . <p> " It 's either a competency issue or there 's some other agenda , and with the Chinese government there is always another agenda and the truth is always the first casualty , " he said . <p> Trump himself had said in January that the virus was " totally under control " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April due to warmer temperatures . <p> The United States has since recorded more than 14,700 deaths , with most of the population under some form of lockdown . <p> As criticism mounted of his own response , Trump heavily condemned Beijing over what he called the " Chinese virus . " <p> But his tone stepped up against the WHO after he spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping and reached a truce with the Asian power , which supplies much of the medical equipment needed in the United States . <p> Trump -- whose tough line on immigration is a signature issue -- in particular has taken umbrage at the WHO 's initial criticism of his ban on visitors from China . <p> The WHO said as of late February that such bans were ineffective and warned of " negative social and economic effects , " but much of the world has now imposed major restrictions on travel . <h> Blame game <p> J. Stephen Morrison , director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said the WHO deserved some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay in declaring a public health emergency . <p> But he said it was important to be realistic about the limited leverage of the WHO , especially when faced with a major power such as China . <p> " What is going on here , I believe , is that this is part of the Washington blame game , " Morrison said . <p> " This is the WHO getting caught in the middle of a worsening US-China confrontation and an increased effort by Washington to deflect attention away from Trump . " <p> Morrison said that Tedros had proven his competence , including the former Ethiopian foreign minister 's successful efforts to fight Ebola in Africa . <p> " It would have had no backing from the US or other powerful states if it had chosen to be confrontational with China at those key moments , " Morrison said of the WHO . <p> " It would have simply had its access terminated . " <h> Geneva response <p> For its part , in Geneva on Wednesday , as the WHO prepared to mark 100 days on Thursday since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tedros hit back at accusations that it had been too close to Beijing . <p> The UN 's health agency has faced criticism in the past both for overreacting and for moving too slowly in fighting epidemics , but it has rarely faced as much scrutiny as with the Covid-19 pandemic . <p> Tedros urged the United States to join with China in combating the disease rather than indulging in a blame game , as he issued a stern defense of the WHO 's management of the pandemic . <p> " The United States and China should come together and fight this dangerous enemy , " Tedros told a virtual press briefing in Geneva . <p> " The focus of all political parties should be to save their people . Please do n't politicize this virus . <p> " If you do n't want many more body bags , then you refrain from politicizing it , " the WHO chief argued , before adding later : " It 's like playing with fire . " <p> Citing the death toll and number of infections , Tedros implored : " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Personal abuse <p> The WHO was deemed too alarmist when it faced the H1N1 epidemic in 2009 but five years later it was accused of dragging its feet in declaring an emergency over the Ebola outbreak in west Africa , which killed more than 11,000 people . <p> On Wednesday , in a highly unusual turn , Ethiopia 's former health and foreign minister spoke out for the first time about personal attacks that have been aimed at him , including racial slurs and a death threat , during the crisis . <p> " I do n't give a damn , " Tedros said . <p> " I am a very proud black person or negro . I do n't care being called even negro ; I am . <p> " When the whole black community was insulted , when Africa was insulted , then I do n't tolerate , " he said , referring to suggestions last week from two scientists about the continent 's suitability as a vaccine testing ground . <h> Superstar support <p> Late Wednesday he retweeted the personal support he has received from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rwanda . <p> United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres lent his support too , saying it was not the time to criticize the early response to the outbreak . <p> " Now is the time for unity , for the international community to work together in solidarity to stop this virus and its shattering consequences , " he said in a statement . <p> Tedros can call also on some top-level celebrity backing , such as US superstar Lady Gaga . <p> He has teamed up with the singer to launch a giant online coronavirus awareness concert on April 18 entitled " One World : Together at Home " , featuring music icons like Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder . <p> Tedros said there would be worse to come from Covid-19 if the world did not unite to stand up to its spread . <p> " Let 's fight like hell to suppress and control this virus , " he said . <p> " Otherwise , with the way we are doing now , I think we will regret it .

But we can only continue to grow with your support . <p> In George Borrow 's 1843 book The Bible in Spain , he reports one of his interlocutors , a servant , as saying to him : " Though I have been turned out of so many families , I was never turned out of that one ; and though I left it thrice , it was of my own free will . " <p> Most readers of this column will be familiar with the word thrice . It occurs , for instance , in the King James Bible : " Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . " At earlier periods of history , all English speakers would have used this word quite naturally as part of their normal everyday speech . <p> Nowadays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most of us never use it . As early as 200 years ago , it had already become somewhat archaic . The most recent citation of the word in the Oxford English Dictionary comes from as long ago as 1859 , from the decidedly uncolloquial verse of Alfred Lord Tennyson , whose Idylls of a King contains the line " ... with some surprise and thrice as much disdain " . George Borrow , too , wrote in what has been called a " pre-Victorian " style . <p> What we would say in modern English instead of thrice , of course , is three times . This change from thrice to three times appears to be part of a pattern . <p> The forms whence and thence have similarly for the most part disappeared from the language , and been replaced by from where and from there : we no longer ask " Whence have you come ? " but " Wherehave you come from ? " . Similarly , whither , hither and thither have been replaced by to where , to here and to there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where are you walking to ? " <p> Linguistic analysts would say that what is happening here is that synthetic structures are being replaced by analytic structures . <p> To get an angle on what this means , we can consider the fact that the word seldom and the two-word phrase not often mean more or less exactly the same thing . " I seldom go " and " I do n't often go " are no different from one another in terms of meaning in any significant way . The negative element of the meaning , and the frequency element of the meaning , are synthesised into the single word seldom while , in not often the two elements have been analysed out and expressed separately . <h> You may also want to watch : <p> The same thing is true of neither and not either , as in " I like neither of them " and " I do not like either of them " . <p> Again , the two different elements of meaning are combined in the single form of neither but are separated out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , the analytical two-word forms feel more natural , and certainly less formal , than their synthetic equivalents . <p> If I am right , seldom is now employed less often -- or more seldom ! -- than not often . And most people are probably more likely to say " I do n't like either of them " rather than " I like neither of them " . <p> This is part of a very long-running trend in the evolution of the English language in which more analytical structures are winning out over synthetic forms . <p> And the process continues : plenty of younger people nowadays seem to be quite happy to say two times rather than twice . <p> To older people this can sound rather childish , but doubtless our own usage of three times would have sounded childish to older speakers in the 18th century when thrice was beginning to fall out of use . It would be interesting to see how long it takes before the surviving form once turns into the equivalent of French une fois or Norwegian en gang , literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yours and ours also appear to be under threat today from potential analytical replacements : younger people are increasingly saying " That 's my one !

In McDevitt , it was causing her heart to fail , which was even rarer . <p> As time went by , things became more serious . Finally , last August , doctors told her it was time to be evaluated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure her body was otherwise well enough to receive a heart transplant such as not having cancer or her bones needing to be strong enough -- despite years of steroids meant to reduce the more serious effects of her illness -- to withstand a transplant . <p> McDevitt waited to be approved and on January 27 -- her son 's birthday and a day before she was scheduled to be admitted to the hospital -- she reached her breaking point : her constant pain and exhaustion sent her to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia , about 60 miles east of the home she shares with her husband , Tom . <p> " My numbers were very borderline , " said McDevitt who was moved to a more urgent status on the list of people in need of a transplant . <p> That day she was admitted , the novel coronavirus was still mostly constrained to China , though it had begun to spread around the globe . It had only killed 106 people and just five people had been diagnosed with the virus in the US . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US soil . <p> " I had never even thought about it , " McDevitt said of COVID-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus . <p> But when McDevitt finally left Jefferson on April 6 -- more than two months after she first walked through the hospital 's doors -- the world was different . <p> " When I walked through the halls I could tell which rooms the coronavirus patients were in because of the PPE that the people had on , so I would know , " McDevitt told Business Insider of her stay in the hospital . " Because of HIPPA , nurses did n't tell you anything . But I knew what the costumes were . " <h> Like most hospitals nationwide , things at Jefferson changed quickly <p> " I always say I came into the twilight zone by myself on the 27th and since then everyone has joined me , " McDevitt joked . <p> First , visitors were no longer allowed , McDevitt said , recalling that the restriction was put in place around her birthday , on March 11 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom , son , Mark , and daughter , Elyse , at Jefferson University Hospitals before it banned visitors . <p> source <p> Elaine McDevitt <p> McDevitt said her husband , Tom , and daughter , Elyse , still visited her to celebrate her birthday as she would n't see them for weeks while she remained in the hospital . She would be alone as she waited for her new heart , when she was rolled to the operating room to have her heart removed from her body , and when she woke up post-surgery , confused from her drug-induced nightmares that the transplant had been ineffective . <p> Her son , Mark , who at the time worked for a Massachusetts congresswoman on Capitol Hill , had already stopped making the trip from DC to Philadelphia to visit his mother even before the hospital officially banned visitors , describing his workplace as a " natural disease vector . " <p> " It was obviously the right call , and in a way , it was comforting to know they were taking drastic measures , " Mark told Business Insider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Soon , masks became the norm for all patients and hospital staff . <p> " Even the people who bring you your food wore them , " McDevitt said . <p> Dr. Ren ? Alvarez , the cardiologist who diagnosed McDevitt with Cardiac Sarcoidosis , told Business Insider that Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals were fortunate in that they were n't facing an imminent shortage in N95 masks , gowns , or other protective equipment needed to protect patients and medical workers from infection . <p> The same ca n't be said for many hospitals around the country , particularly in areas that have experienced severe outbreaks of the virus . In New York City , for example , which has faced the most severe outbreak of COVID-19 in the US , some hospital staff were told to reuse N95 masks until they were " soiled " or damaged . <p> Nurses , also in New York , have reported shortages of other Personal Protective Equipment ( PPE ) , including gowns and were thus advised to use garbage bags to protect themselves and their patients . <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday reported having less than a one week supply of goggles , gowns , face shields , N95 masks , and paper medical masks -- all worn to protect healthcare workers and their patients from infectious diseases , like COVID-19 . <p> Nurses at Jefferson continued their close contact with patients like Elaine , though nurses were assigned to a set group of patients , limiting potential exposure as they were " constantly wearing gloves and changing them , " McDevitt said . There was also a moratorium on hugs in the hospital , she said . <p> At Jefferson , doctors no longer came to their patient 's bedside unless it was absolutely necessary . Instead , they stood in the doorway to talk to their patients . On March 25 , McDevitt was told doctors had found a potential organ donor . Her transplant specialist told her the good news from the doorway of her hospital room while she sat in her hospital room ready to eat lunch . <p> " He was on the phone , and he gestured to me and said ' do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right away , I knew what that meant . I had tears in my eyes . " <p> Still , McDevitt did n't want to get her hopes up . It was n't the first time doctors provided a similar heads up . At the end of February , McDevitt 's medical team told her they had found a potential heart . They eventually passed on the organ because the donor had recently traveled to a country experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak . <p> " You have individuals that -- clearly -- they ca n't wait , " Dr. Howard Massey , the surgical director of cardiac transplantation at Jefferson University Hospital told Business Insider . " There was no way Elaine could wait to get a heart transplant . She was going to die and that was very evident . If there had been any way possible to delay this in her , we would have , but that was just not an option for her . " <h> Despite the threats posed by the disease , doctors still work to provide essential care <p> " We are delivering this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the best of our ability , " Massey said of the numerous organ transplants that occur at the hospital . <p> Still , he noted , hospitals have made efforts to free up beds for potential COVID-19 patients and to limit the number of other patients in the hospital who could be exposed by other patients or staff . <p> " There are certain risks in coming into the hospital environment , and certainly we are doing everything we can to protect individuals within the hospital , " Massey said . " Infections and risks like that are inherent within the hospital , so we do n't want to potentially expose someone to a perceived risk unless we absolutely have to . " <p> McDevitt had eventually undergone her transplant surgery on March 26 . She was intubated and placed on a ventilator , which is common for patients after a transplant operation , amid a nationwide shortage of ventilators needed to help the most serious COVID-19 patients . <p> Despite her successful surgery , McDevitt faced a new risk : the immuno-suppressive drugs she needed to continuously take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her at high risk for COVID-19 . <p> " I said to my doctors , in tears , ' Am I going to be able to survive the heart transplant and the virus ? " McDevitt recalled . <p> Her doctors -- both her cardiologist and transplant specialist -- told Business Insider that she can survive amid the pandemic , but there are still risks . <p> " If you were to look at the risk of having serious infections related to COVID-19 , she would fall in one of the high-risk groups , " Massey said , adding " their immune systems are altered from the medication we utilize , but it 's still intact and they still have the ability to fight infections . " <p> " There are some medications we can utilize to help with that , but it is a balance , " he continued . " Unfortunately in transplantation today , it 's the balance between too much immune suppression versus too little . " <p> Alvarez , McDevitt 's cardiologist , said patients and doctors are continuing to adjust medical procedures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes have meant completing post-op physical therapy in her room and avoiding unnecessary trips in the hallway . Normally , recovering patients are encouraged to walk the halls and take the stairs at the hospital as a means of physical therapy . That could put McDevitt at risk , so her exercises were confined to her hospital room . <p> caption <p> Elaine McDevitt completed post-op physical therapy in her room away from other patients and staff . <p> source <p> Elaine McDevitt <p> She also had a virtual conference -- typically held at her bedside -- with a nurse coordinator and a transplant pharmacist to discuss the new medications she needed to take , Alvarez told Business Insider . <p> Temporary changes like these , he added , could lead to permanent shifts in medical care as the coronavirus pandemic has shown the effectiveness of telemedicine . <p> " I think this COVID pandemic will teach us a lot of things . One , that telemedicine and virtual care works and patients are engaged , and it has been very effective , " he said . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all transplant patients , " Dana Gonzales , one of McDevitt 's nurses said the day McDevitt was released from the hospital . " Of course . I worry for everyone and anyone . But we do all the practices and guidelines the CDC put out , and we just do the best we can do . " <p> Luckily , a self-described homebody , McDevitt has no plans of leaving the home she returned to on April 6 and is isolating with her husband . Her home is currently closed to visitors -- doctor 's orders -- despite occasional visits from a traveling nurse and physical therapist . <p> She still has n't seen her kids . <p> " I miss them , " McDevitt said , " but they are super conscious of my condition and we all are thankful for FaceTime.

@@41904841 <p> Earlier today ( 11 April ) , the Malaysian Health Coalition ( MHC ) released a press statement urging the Malaysian government to consider the additional measures during the Movement Control Order ( MCO ) Phase 3 . <p> The apolitical coalition that consists of 42 member societies and 16 individuals had come up with five suggestions for the government to look into to support the flattening of the curve in regards to the outbreak of Covid-19 in Malaysia . While the coalition supports the government 's decision to extend the MCO until 28 April , they hope that the " new normal " that Malaysians are supposed to get used to can be supported with the measures they suggested . <p> Here is a list of FIVE measures the MHC stated : <p> Increase testing capabilities <p> Preserve routine healthcare services <p> Activate public-private partnerships <p> Introduce risk-based guidelines for the post-MCO period <p> Increase support for vulnerable communities <p> Basically , the MHC is calling for mass testing to determine the accurate picture of the pandemic as well as to cut down on the asymptomatic transmissions which could lead to future spikes of cases . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information for effective contact tracing and surveillance . <p> As for their second suggested measure -- preserve routine healthcare service , the MHC raised concerns on Malaysian 's physical and mental health because the extended physical distancing may negatively impact us . Therefore , they thought it was necessary to preserve the routine healthcare services despite the implementation and extension of MCO . <p> " We suggest utilising technology and telecommunications infrastructure , such as telephone hotlines and video calls , as well as activating public-private partnerships in order to deliver necessary services . " <p> The coalition also urged both public and private healthcare services such as hospitals , clinics , pharmacies and laboratories to provide the capacity to beat Covid-19 . <p> Seeing how MCO will be lifted eventually , the MHC pressed that a clear guideline should be established for all sectors . As Malaysians return to the workforce to restart the country 's economy , the coalition thought that it would be better if the community can utilise a colour-coded risk-based system . For example , people living in " green " districts may be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are allowed to reopen should also be given a guideline on proper infection control methods . <p> Lastly , the coalition calls for increased support for the vulnerable communities such as the B40 economic group , which comprises Malaysia 's indigenous population , daily wage workers , immigrant populations , refugees and rural citizens . The coalition understands that the MCO will impact the livelihoods of these communities , so they 're urging the government to guarantee their food security and economic welfare . <p> The MHC that was established on 1 March 2020 has the purpose of protecting Malaysian citizens ' health by uniting health professionals as well as to support the Ministry of Health . Their existence is to reassure the citizens by providing relevant information and instructions during this difficult time .

For those of you who vaguely remember it and for those of you who only know it by name , SARS , or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus named SARS-associated coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) . <p> The virus was first found in the Guangdong province in China during November of 2002 . By 10th February 2003 , Chinese authorities had reported to the World Health Organisation that over 305 cases of SARS were found within their nation , as well as five deaths . <p> But that was only the beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , infecting over 8,000 people and killing at least 774 people , according to the UK 's National Health Service . <p> Cases of SARS were identified by flu-like symptoms that include fevers , sudden fatigue , muscle pains , headaches , and diarrhea , all of which often take two to seven days to set in . <p> SARS in Malaysia <p> While SARS did eventually wind up reaching Malaysian shores , the cases that we recorded were actually drastically lower than that of our neighbour , Singapore . During the SARS crisis , which lasted from 2003 to 2004 , Malaysia only recorded five probable cases and two deaths , while Singapore recorded over 238 cases and 33 deaths . <p> But what exactly did Malaysia do during that period of time , and what measures did we take to prevent the SARS outbreak from spreading in our nation ? <p> What did Malaysia do during the SARS outbreak ? <p> If one were to look at the containment methods used during the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the ones that are being used now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Malaysia recorded low numbers of cases locally , more effort was put into early detection , contact surveillance , and screening activities , as this paper from the World Health Organisation states . <p> The first most important step made by the government at the time was to set up a National SARS Operations Room on 16th March 2003 , which enables the government to receive reports of SARS cases in Malaysia . Which means all suspected cases of SARS in Malaysia had to be notified to the authorities immediately , much like what we 're doing now ! <p> Probable SARS carriers will be instructed to self-quarantine at home for 10 days and remain in active contact with healthcare officials . Sounds familiar , right ? <p> A nationwide awareness campaign was also held to inform the public of the SARS outbreak , as well as daily press briefings with local and international media on decisions made to contain the virus . <p> In terms of travel restrictions , Malaysia also enforced a number of drastic changes to ensure that those that came from countries that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from entering Malaysia altogether . These regulations included : <p> Prohibiting entry of tourists from countries that were most heavily affected by the virus , which included China , Hong Kong , Vietnam , Taiwan and Canada . However , the ban , which was enforced in 10th April 2003 , was then lifted after a week . <p> Chinese &amp; Vietnamese visa applications to Malaysia had to be submitted with medical reports that showed applicants did not suffer from SARS in the past seven days . <p> Thermal scanners were installed at all international entry points into Malaysia to screen for suspected SARS cases . <p> All arriving passengers had to fill in health declaration cards that showed their country of origin and whether they displayed symptoms of SARS . <p> As you can imagine , a global health crisis like that would require a proper team of healthcare professionals to handle in Malaysia . So of course , the Ministry of Health responded swiftly ! <p> Over 21 hospitals were designated to treat suspected cases of SARS in Malaysia . <p> All suspected cases of SARS were admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each hospital involved had to have a dedicated SARS team on call . <p> Patients were only discharged on the condition that they no longer exhibited high fevers , coughing , and if their chest X-rays and laboratory tests showed a clean bill of health for 72 hours . <p> Even then , they still had to be quarantined upon discharge for up to 10 days , and had to report back to their hospitals if any fevers develop ! See how careful our Ministry was ? <p> The End of The Storm &amp; How It Reflects On Us Today <p> By 5th July 2003 , the World Health Organisation declared that the SARS outbreak had been contained , but pockets of cases continued to be identified in China up to May 2004 . In total , five cases were only found in Malaysia , with two deaths reported . <p> It is worth noting however that despite also being a coronavirus , the spread of Covid-19 and that of SARS is wildly different , with public health expert Khor Swee Kheng telling South China Morning Press that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what happened 17 years ago . <p> " This is for several reasons : Covid-19 the disease caused by the coronavirus has infected many more people than either Sars or Nipah , it has affected many more countries , and the world is more interconnected in 2020 than 2003 or 1999 . " <p> He also observes the fact that the mitigation of the rising number of Covid-19 cases can only be hampered if Malaysians continue to cooperate and adhered to the Movement Control Order . <p> But given the fact that Malaysians are still flouting official calls to stay home , this may prove to be more difficult for Malaysia than it is for countries like Italy , where a slight drop in the percentage of cases has been reported since their nationwide lockdown . This is compounded by the fact that Malaysian medical staff are now running low on medical supplies . <p> So how can you do your part to help stop the Covid-19 crisis ? Simple ! Stay at home , avoid going out unless absolutely necessary , and always practice good hygiene habits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like to handle a viral outbreak , we still have to take all the necessary precautions today !

Though the Indian government has been doing a commendable job to counter the coronavirus epidemic by imposing a countrywide lockdown at the right time , the impact of it would be severe on the government 's balance sheet .

Therefore , the HDFC stock has also not been spared with the price declining from around Rs 2,200 odd levels to Rs 1,500 in a matter of two weeks in March 2020 . Since then , the stock price has climbed to Rs 1,700 levels in the last one week .

He suggested that companies with common needs should work together and engage a good solution provider to come up with a practical , affordable solution , much like the group-based upgrading projects initiated by the SME Centres . <p> Cybersecurity is another challenge the industry will need to tackle as more vendors and users come on board . Kevin Reed , chief information security officer at cybersecurity firm Acronis , noted that the recent security risks uncovered in videoconferencing platform Zoom are a cautionary tale of the need to find and fix vulnerabilities before a software is made available to a wide user base . <p> " If no steps are taken now and the VR industry scores a similar rapid rise in demand , the top vendors will be facing massive security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr Reed . The main vulnerabilities would lie in security protocols and whether data is moved via secure servers , he said . <p> Although immersive technology is more advanced in other markets like the US , Europe , the UK , China and Australia , local players still believe there is room for them to bring something new to the table . <p> As new applications for the technology surface , Serl.io is well positioned to meet demand for training platforms and content in these new fields , said Mr Loo .

@@41913841 <p> The crisis of the Covid-19 virus spread , unprecedented in modern times , is having a devastating impact on lives and livelihoods . At the time of writing , a quarter of the world 's population is in " lockdown " -- an emergency protocol of forced self-isolation and social distancing to avoid the high rate of transmission . This while doctors and scientists scramble to provide life-saving treatment that can get our communities and economies back on track . In this extraordinary collectively restricted , and highly anxious context , many questions are being asked of our society . How come we are in this situation ? What is Covid-19 shining a light on in our underlying mindsets and behaviour ? Is how we run our political institutions , economies and communities today really something to be proud of ? Will we come out of this a changed world , and , a world for the better ? <p> In this series of articles , our aim is to ask questions about how we and our leaders are handling change within this disruptive challenge , and to offer some frameworks of thinking and practice that might enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows in this unprecedented situation , what " right " looks like . <p> This , the second article in the series , examines how the quality of a leader 's inner state fundamentally drives the quality of their outer action , and we set out the four Still Moving " Inner Capacities " , which our research has found account for over half the reason why big change either succeeds , or fails . Ignore this " to be list " at your peril ! <p> In times like this , when it becomes obvious that we do n't know what the future holds and certainty breaks away , we turn inside ourselves to find certainty . As social distancing requires most of us to clear our diaries from face-to-face meetings , conferences and the daily commute to work , so space opens -- while , simultaneously , our lives seem to contract into our homes , with only very few if any people ( and animals ) around us . What can feel difficult and/or easy to avoid in other times , is a natural for right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eye of the storm . <p> So , amidst all hardship the crisis does offer us the opportunity to investigate whether we leap to do , or do we look to be ? Why is this important in leading disruptive change ? Well , we have found that a leader 's ability to first tune into and regulate their inner mental and emotional response to experience can make or break their ability to tune into and move the system around them . If they can not use the pivotal muscle of their inner world , they might lead a lot of busy stuck-in-the-groove " doing " action , but not change the system more deeply from its " being " source . <p> Just look around at others and notice how they are operating for clues into appropriate inner strategies of leadership in a crisis . When German Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed her people in an unprecedented TV appearance , it was as much her calmness and ability to tune into the system and its needs , as the content of her speech , that moved the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those seen as the most credible are two virologists who can paint a nuanced picture of what they know and what they do n't know , what they feel prepared to have a view on and where they feel out of their depths . They resist the repeated temptation to give in to questions and provide simple answers , not reacting to the pressure but instead responding truthfully and from a fresh perspective . It seems they have a clear sense of who they are and what they can contribute that helps them step into their leadership in a way that appeals to people and engenders trust and followership . <p> This fully echoes the research findings of Still Moving : with a correlation of 52% , the quality of our actions is critically contingent on the quality of our inner state . This is due in part to our own physical well-being and our ability to perform ( the Dutch Health Minister fainted during a parliament debate after too many days of high pace and little sleep ) . But , it goes beyond that -- as spiritual traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find the metaphor of the vine and the grapes : only the good vine bears good fruit , the corrupt vine needing to be pruned so as not to spoil all ( John 15 ) . True strength comes from knowing yourself and the inner source that leads or pulls you . <p> How , therefore , to cultivate the vine ? Below is our " to be list " , the set of inner capacities correlated with leading highly successful change . They are written up extensively elsewhere . Here , we thought we 'd illustrate the capacities by inviting you to imagine practicing them during what might now be an all-too-familiar scenario -- the quality of your inner state during an online , from-your-home , video conference call with your team , or clients ... <p> Staying present : notices what is here , now . Only when we notice what is really going on in the present moment -- for us and others -- can we do something about it . To be fully present on a video conference , you may need to shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have what you need to keep focussed attention -- a drink to hand , a comfortable chair , breaks when you or others are getting tired . It also means being accepting of what is here , now -- not yearning for the immediacy of a face-to-face meeting , and acknowledging that it requires more effort to stay present when your kids might be playing in the background . This non-judgemental attitude clears our minds so that we can open up and work with the possibilities right in front of us . A hallmark of a great change leader . <p> Curious and intentional responding : chooses the nature of experience . We are primed to work efficiently on autopilot to cope with complexity and high stress levels . This can limit our ability to choose a fresh response to what we experience , for example when a participant in the video call " always seems to not get what is really the issue here " . We can get so caught up in our own emotions , that we unconsciously only operate from that point -- anger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our emotions can be contagious , whole situations can get stuck in an unhelpful state . So , if you feel like this on that video call , can you " hit the pause button " on your response and not react with unconscious routines , in order to gain deeper insight and find more creative solutions than the dance around same old , same old ? By switching your inner response to what is being experienced , so will you switch other people 's responses , too . Try it out next time ! <p> Tuning into the system : perceives reality accurately . Though true for all situations , the technology of a video conference really brings home that our perception of reality on the screen is n't completely synchronised with others . If we use Zoom as the online platform , the arrangement of speaker pictures on the screen varies between participants . You can only effectively communicate with them if you share what you see and inquire into their reality . So , pay attention to and inquire about what you are noticing in the call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- these visible signs are important data not just about this group , but also echoes of the wider system and context that your team are operating in right now . Experiment seeing this group on the call as a " fractal " of the wider whole . <p> Change leaders tune into what is really going on in front of them to discern what they need to do to create genuine movement in the system at large . <p> Acknowledging the whole : integrates all of experience . Many of us prefer the direct human contact in a face-to-face meeting . So , we can spend a lot of energy on dealing with the sense of loss and betrayal as we are asked to embrace new forms of collaborating . Can you work with any of the new discomfort you feel and see how these restrictions could in fact become helpful resources ? Leaders who can lean into difficulty without being scared , irritated or defensive , productively strengthen their organisations to see the value in a situation , engendering new insights or a deeper understanding of what really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 crisis brings -- can we also look at it as a wake-up call that invites us to re-assess the choices we have made in the past and will have to make in the future ? A change leader would ask , how can our move to working online and at a physical distance , be helpful ( beyond beating the virus ) ? <p> The current invitation to self-reflect and turn inward also extends to us at Still Moving -- as change consultants and supervisors , what is the value we can bring to this situation and beyond ? How can we find new ways to share our findings and support clients when support is restricted to remote settings ? How can we envision a new relationship with our clients at a time when many plans are postponed or cancelled ? What might we need to learn about what we do n't know ? We have certainly needed to hit the pause button and notice and handle our own inner responses to the radical change in context . <p> The last few weeks have seen many quality actions coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep their distance joining each other in song to build connections , creative ways of expressing gratitude to health care professionals at a certain time , and countless little acts of solidarity and caring that in the face of this global threat created a monument to humanity -- so , what does the above " to be " list enable you to do ? <p> Read on for next week 's issue on what it is leaders need to do to be effective in times of complex change . <p> ? ? ? <p> Notes : <p> This blog post expresses the views of its author(s) , not the position of LSE Business Review or the London School of Economics . <p> Deborah Rowland has led change in major global corporations including BBC Worldwide , Gucci Group , PepsiCo and Shell , where she had vice-president of organisational development and group HR director roles .

However , the latest reading of inflation came out at 1.7% . This means we need to generate at least 1.7% in interest just to stop the value of our money being eroded by inflation . Anything above that becomes real yield , which is what we want . <h> How stocks can help with low interest rates <p> Most businesses within the FTSE 100 pay dividends . This has given rise to a common financial ratio of a dividend yield . This seeks to compare the size of the dividend with the share price of the firm . When you see what proportion of the share price is paid as a dividend , you can obtain a percentage value . You can then use this almost as a proxy for an interest rate . <p> Let us take an example . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It currently has a dividend yield of 5.18% . While this is n't officially an interest rate , we can use it as a fair comparison . How does it compare to other income-paying assets ? Well , we have already seen above that interest rates are 0.1% , so it beats savings accounts easily . Bonds pay a coupon , which is classified as income . Yet the yield on a generic UK Government bond is only around 0.5% . So again , a dividend-paying stock offers a substantially higher income for an investor . <h> Higher income , higher risk ? <p> One point investors should note is that receiving income from a dividend-paying stock does come with higher risk than a Cash ISA or bond . This is because dividends can be cut or reduced , depending on company performance .

@@41915241 <h> How behaviour of Thai consumers are evolving amidst COVID-19 <p> Details <p> Grace Ong <p> 15 April 2020 <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the world by storm as governments implement social distancing measures in efforts to curb the spread of the virus . According to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , Thailand has 2,613 confirmed cases and 41 deaths at the time of writing . In the past two weeks , both Phuket and Pattaya have went into lockdown that will last until the end of April . Under the lockdown , people and vehicles are not allowed to enter or leave the area , and the public is urged to stay at home . <p> While the pandemic may take months to recover , Sora Kaitkanarat , chief strategy officer of IPG Mediabrands Thailand said it could probably set new beginnings of consumers ' demands and behaviours . This change may also become the " new normal " even after the pandemic . Kaitkanarat foresees eight ways that consumer behaviour in Thailand might change post-pandemic due to the adjusted lifestyle consumers will adopt during this period of social distancing . He termed the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the word " DISTANCE " representing a specific behavioural change in Thai consumers in the coming days . <p> 1 . Digitised purchases <p> Consumers are staying at home more due to social distancing measures , and turning to digital services to carry out their chores or errands . This ranges from purchasing household products , foods , and other daily necessities from online platforms and having them delivered . Kaitkanarat said that FMCG products have broken the eCommerce barrier during this pandemic , as he foresees majority of consumers will continue to do online purchases for their daily needs , and contribute to eCommerce sales . <p> 2 . In-home in style <p> With consumers staying at home , social life has become personal , daily routine-centric , and has extra authenticity without additional beautification . Kaitkanarat said the demand for " Instagrammable " food delivery with disposable packages will become the new normal for food pictures posted on social media , as well as the presentation of home-cooked food from large families . He also expects a shift in shopping behaviour , where consumers will purchase more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of shops visited or delivery costs . <p> 3 . Sanitation of five senses <p> Businesses will have to adopt new levels of cleanliness moving forward . The stamp of hygiene for shops will be in demand to enhance the level of trust at point-of-sale . Kaitkanarat said using sanitising products will continue to be the norm , and retail outlets will be expected to provide hand sanitisers . There could also be an emergence of contactless services in shops to maintain hygiene , such as using voice-command features for shops selling luxury goods . <p> 4 . Tech-finance literacy <p> More consumers will use tech-finance platforms due to their increased consciousness to be hygienic , as well as their need for convenience , according to Kaitkanarat . Consumers will use more digital features such as digital banking , e-wallet , and cashless payment . The rise in adoption of tech-finance will also boost the eCommerce sector . <p> 5 . Anxious about health <p> It is also expected that consumers will be more anxious about their health , and the rise of preventive health care will be fast-tracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunity enhancement food will continue to rise at the cost of anxiety , while the search for symptoms will be on top of daily self-observation . These behavioural changes will widen the petition of telemedicine , especially now that nearly all generations are digitally literate . Online consultation in both physical and mental health will also step into the new era of digitised health and wellness . <p> 6 . Nouveau trust <p> Thai consumers will re-evaluate their trust in established brands , products , and services as hygiene becomes fundamental to brand equity . They will also have more appreciation for brands that do good . Additionally , the demand for the accuracy of information and content will continue to rise , especially in social content . Food delivery services will also experience additional demands of recyclable and hygienic packaging , as well as sealed personalised packaging . <p> 7 . Conversion of media appreciation <p> The demand of a hygienic world will drive physical engagement media to adapt to the next level of sanitation . Theatres , events , and product-testing will operate in a hyper hygienic environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the adjusted behavior . Social power will be much stronger than ever before with less polarisation , as the sole purpose has shifted and expanded from personal agenda to be more for the collective purpose of the society , which will also dilute the possibility of fake and misleading news . The level of data signals will be much more in-depth , with geolocation related , and with more consents from individuals for the better good , and sustainability of the healthy quality of life . <p> 8 . Evolving of home and duty <p> Weeks of work-from-home has demystified the new level of productivity and work-life balance , work-life harmony . Consumers or employees will continue to urge the home-at-work and work-at-home experience in order to manage their lives in more efficient and effective ways . This is aligned with the future potential of home-schooling .

@@41921741 <p> I 've been thinking a lot lately about the month I spent in bed with pneumonia when I was nine . I still remember many of the classics I read during that hiatus , books I 've given my daughter and my many nieces as gifts over the years . Right before the coronavirus hit New York , one of my nieces told me she saved all the books I gave her and she ca n't wait until her daughter , my great-niece , is old enough to read them . <p> Reading fiction is a great way to escape when the world around you is in turmoil , and good fiction gives you insight into how those who are different from you think and feel , helping to build empathy . <p> In college , War and Peace was on the syllabus my sophomore year when I spent a week in the college infirmary with bronchitis . Reading it was the only thing I had enough energy for , and it is still one of my favorite books of all time . Well worth the effort . <p> I 'm currently reading Oracle Bones by Peter Hessler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction - but it is a fascinating read . <p> But it is notable that fiction sales , along with home-learning titles , experienced the greatest boost as the UK 's lockdown began , because this indicates that it is not facts that people are after , but stories . <p> And fiction is certainly what seems to guide so many of the regular posters below the line . <p> New government-backed online school to open its virtual doors to support pupils while schools are closed <p> @OakNational Academy is a collaboration between teachers and organisations across the sector to provide 180 hours of free lessons a week , while schools remain closed for the majority of pupils . <p> There 'll be curriculum based content starting at reception and going up to year 10 . <p> It 's been developed in under two weeks as a direct response to the current situation with the aim of supporting schools and teachers as they support their pupils remotely . <p> A national online classroom and resource hub will provide a plan of daily lessons and resources to assist teachers , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oak National Academy will open its virtual doors on Monday 20th April , the day term re-starts after the Easter holidays . <p> Created by a group of primary and secondary school teachers in under two weeks , Oak National Academy will provide a sequenced plan of video lessons and curricular resources for teachers to use as they wish , to complement their existing teaching and planning . <p> It is a long time since I read the Plague .... but Jose Saramago 's ( a Nobel prize winner ) Blindness gives a dystopian account of where this might lead . especially in giving governments total control and power over the contagion . Two things can go wrong ... one is an inept response , like here in the UK ; the other is the likelihood that once they have tasted powers they can not give them up and will abuse it ( think terror legislation ) . <p> Sometimes the by line of your articles is hillarious .

I was a sceptic in the true sense , so my trying was strictly logical . It never occurred to me to be afraid , even then I knew only the living were a danger . <p> Agreed , Frank Kafka and Beckett are firm favourites of mine , but Terry Pratchet was in a previous comment , THUD is about the last truly good one , he was slipping on the humour and invention even then ? Never much liked cyberpunk so Gibson is not a favourite of mine . <p> The opening chapter of Boccaccio 's Decameron is worth reading under current conditions .

Absurd but wonderfully written and very funny . <p> It also might be worth revisiting some of the books you loved as a kid . I 've been reading Leon Garfield and Rosemary Sutcliffe books recently . Children 's fiction , but with serious themes , good plots and convincing characters . <p> I can not understand why people would want to read books about plagues while they are in lockdown because of a pandemic ( modern word for plague , I guess ) . I wonder if reading of the Decameron , a book about people passing the time whilst in lockdown due to a pandemic , has also increased ? <p> I have nearly 2000 books in my little home library.Reading has been my passion from a very young age .

C. <p> The symptoms , including fatigue , chills and severe aches , often occur abruptly when compared to the common cold , and may develop into pneumonia . <p> " Usually , they can present with just inactivity and might not even have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and may have vomiting , or even diarrhoea . <p> " By the time the parents realise that the child is unwell , they could already be very , very sick with either rapid or irregular breathing . " <p> Bear in mind that it is important that you bring your child to see their doctor if they fall sick . <p> Pneumonia symptoms may look like other health problems , so parents should always seek a proper medical diagnosis for their children . <p> " You ca n't go to the pharmacy and say ' My child has pneumonia ' and ask for medicines . <p> " You would n't know . You still need to go to the doctor to make a clinical diagnosis . <p> " The doctor will make the decision on whether the treatment will be done at home , at the hospital or in an intensive care unit ( ICU ) , " she says . <p> Test and treat <p> A course of antibiotics is a common treatment for mild cases of pneumonia . -- TNS <p> A variety of tests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child has pneumonia . <p> The first step is the physical examination where the doctor may hear abnormal sounds in the lungs using the stethoscope . <p> This finding will prompt further testing to determine the root cause of the abnormal sounds . <p> Both chest X-rays and blood tests can be done to check for signs of infection . <p> Another option is a nasal swab to check for common infectious microorganisms . <p> Once a diagnosis of pneumonia is made , the decision on what treatment to give will depend on how severe the pneumonia is . <p> Treatment is usually supportive , e.g. bed rest and lots of fluids , as pneumonia is often viral , which has no cure . <p> Mild symptoms of pneumonia are commonly treated with at least a short course of antibiotics lasting three to five days at home , before the patient is seen again for reevaluation . <p> " However , if a child is displaying moderate or severe symptoms , they will need to be admitted . <p> " They will likely need intravenous ( IV ) antibiotics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on . <p> " Usually , for a majority of children with pneumonia , if given the right treatment , it will get resolved with no residual effects on them , " says Dr Norzila . <p> Risk of infection <p> Among the risk factors for developing pneumonia is age . The two most vulnerable groups to pneumonia are children under the age of two years and adults aged 65 and above . <p> " For the younger children , it 's because their immunity is still developing , " Dr Norzila explains . <p> " Then , you also have children who are not immunised . They are at a greater risk of contracting pneumonia . " <p> These children include those who are born with an immunodeficiency and have low immunity , child cancer patients and those on immunosuppressant medication , e.g. children who have received an organ transplant . <p> A lot of risk factors are external . <p> Exposure to a dirty , unhygienic environment or large crowds of people increases the possibility of being exposed to infectious microorganisms . <p> The lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered immunity to infections . <p> " Taking the pneumococcal vaccine , Haemophilus influenzae type B ( Hib ) vaccine and other flu vaccines available reduces the risk of pneumonia in vulnerable groups , especially the young children . " <p> Besides providing your children with a clean and healthy environment to grow up in , vaccination is a big protective measure to help guard your children against certain infectious diseases . <p> It is also an affordable measure as the Hib vaccine is provided free to all Malaysian children as part of the National Immunisation Programme , while the pneumococcal vaccine is also set to be provided under the programme starting in June ( 2020 ) . <p> A recurring problem <p> Marley Shelton ( left ) and Jake Gyllenhaal star in the 2001 film Bubble Boy , where Gyllenhaal plays a man who has no immune system . Children with low immunity , whether from an immunodeficiency , cancer treatment or immunosuppressant medication , are especially at risk of developing pneumonia . <p> Picture this : Your child falls ill one day and you bring him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of pneumonia and provides the appropriate treatment . <p> Your child completes the treatment , recovers and goes home well . <p> However , a couple of months later , he develops another case of pneumonia . <p> He gets treated and recovers , but the cycle repeats itself again a couple of months down the road . <p> This is a major concern for doctors . Says Dr Norzila : " The other thing that I 'm always concerned about is recurrent pneumonia . <p> " There are children who get pneumonia once or twice , but there are some children who keep coming to the hospital with recurrent pneumonia . " <p> As the name implies , recurrent pneumonia is defined as three or more episodes of pneumonia in a lifetime , or two or more episodes within a six-month period . <p> It is a condition that should be investigated with urgency to determine the underlying causes . <p> Recurrent pneumonia occurs mainly for three reasons : <p> Structural issues between the bronchus , the breathing tube of the body , and the oesophagus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immunodeficiency <p> A structural problem between the bronchus and the oesophagus , like a fistula between the two tubes , may result in fluid getting into the lungs during drinking or feeding . <p> This could result in an infection of the air sacs , i.e. pneumonia . <p> " Reflux means that when they drink milk , it goes into the stomach , then comes back up again in the opposite direction . <p> " At most , normally , it goes back into the oesophagus . However , sometimes , it can be so severe that the milk moves so far up that it goes into the lungs , " says Dr Norzila . <p> As for children with immunodeficiency , their low immunity means that their body is unable to fight off invading microorganisms , causing them to be at risk for recurrent infections , including pneumonia . <p> Pneumonia is a potentially serious disease that affects many children around the world . <p> While there are preventive measures and lifestyle adjustments you can make to minimise the risk of your children catching this disease , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child has pneumonia , do bring them to the doctor quickly . <p> For more information , email **25;1956;TOOLONG .

They have now accepted that , in most countries , that simply ca n't happen . <p> " Now they are saying , by condensing the later stages of the Champions League and Europa League into one big block in August , that domestic leagues can finish their seasons in July as there will be no midweek European fixtures to contend with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to do this .

But children up to the age of 16 are still attending school , shops and restaurants are still open -- albeit with rules preventing people standing up at the bar -- and no police officer is to blow a whistle at you for sitting on a park bench . <p> For some , Sweden is taking a measured approach which allows it to fight Covid-19 without ruining its economy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's lives . The debate rages within Sweden itself , with the country 's chief epidemiologist , Anders Tegnell , having to defend his policy against increasingly loud calls for a Swedish lockdown . As for the evidence we have so far , it can be used to argue it either way . As of Saturday , Sweden had suffered 150 deaths from Covid-19 per million population . That is significantly more than its locked-down Nordic neighbours -- Denmark was on 60 , Norway on 30 and Finland on 17 -- but a long way short of other European countries which have been in lockdown for weeks . Britain has suffered 228 deaths per million , France 296 , Italy 384 and Spain 441 . The worst country , incidentally , is none of these -- it is Belgium , with 490 deaths per million . <p> Tegnell is not a maverick ; his views on how best to handle Covid-19 are backed by other epidemiologists in Sweden and around the world . One of them is the man who held his job between 1995 and 2005 -- Johan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unpaid adviser to the World Health Organisation . ' We should wait a year before we start passing judgement on the different approaches to coronavirus , ' he says . While some countries might have fended off the worst of the epidemic for now , they face a longer battle against the disease because their populations are further away from gaining immunity . Giesecke supports Tegnell 's claim -- made in a debate this weekend on Norwegian TV -- that Stockholm could have built up a good degree of herd immunity by the middle of May . Community antibody tests are still being analysed , he says , but there is some indication that ' ten , twenty , 30 per cent , maybe more ' of those in the city have already had the virus , many of them unaware of it . <p> If those figures are right , then it would add to evidence from Germany and California suggesting that Covid-19 is far more easily spread -- but considerably less deadly -- than many countries ' policies on the epidemic have assumed . It would blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , which inspired the UK government to undertake a U-turn , abandoning a Swedish-style approach and taking the country into lockdown . <p> Giesecke was not impressed with the Imperial paper . It failed to take into account , he says , that a country can rapidly increase its number of critical care beds . In Sweden , he says , they have increased threefold , which has reduced the need to ' flatten the curve ' of the epidemic . Moreover , he says , ' the assumption they made for the proportion of cases that are asymptomatic was too low . ' The paper made the assumption that two thirds of cases were ' sufficiently symptomatic ' for people to self-isolate -- in other words that in a third of cases infected individuals would not know they had the virus . Subsequent data from Italy and China has suggested that 50 to 80 per cent of cases are asymptomatic . <p> Boris Johnson 's government has persistently said that it is ' following the science ' on coronavirus , but what has become increasingly clear as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science ' . Epidemiologists are themselves deeply divided on how to handle it . ' I think it has a lot to do with modelling , ' says Giesecke . ' In the UK you have too much faith in modelling -- not just on coronavirus but on other things . Models are no better than the assumptions that are put into them . ' <p> On what evidence basis , I ask him , is the Swedish approach based ? He turns the question around . ' We are saying that you should not adopt measures for which there is not good evidence . There is good evidence that washing hands makes a big difference but border controls do n't make a difference , and on closing schools the jury is still out . ' <p> A coronavirus vaccine should be more straightforward , he says , than an HIV vaccine -- which in the 1980s was widely claimed to be four or five years away , but which we still do n't have . A drug to prevent coagulation of blood in patients ' lungs is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death rates . But there is no point in trying to stop coronavirus , he says . It is likely to gain , like the common cold , a long-term presence in the human population . But by the end of summer he expects the measures against coronavirus to be over in most European countries . ' But in those countries with lockdowns it will take longer , ' he says . <p> As for the legacy of Covid-19 , we are likely to be better prepared in future . One thing , he says however , will never go back to normal : the management of old people 's homes . ' Either people will live more in their own homes or they will live in homes with better-trained staff . In Sweden carers are paid-for by the hour , and are n't paid if they have to stay at home because they are ill . ' One of the reasons , he says , that Norway has had a lower death rate is that its care homes are smaller , so the disease has not been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes . <p> And the ultimate result of the Swedish experiment ? Ultimately , he expects , most countries will have much the same mortality rate . Sweden , though , the government of Stefan L ? fven will be hoping , might just have bit more of an economy left . <p> What has become increasingly clear as the crisis has progressed is that there is no one ' science '

We are creating habitats where viruses are transmitted more easily , and then we are surprised that we have new ones , " said Jones . <p> Disease ecologist , Thomas Gillespie also pointed out that humans are the ones creating conditions for the spread of diseases by reducing the natural barriers between host animals and themselves . <p> " Major landscape changes are causing animals to lose habitats , which means species become crowded together and also come into greater contact with humans .

Yet , instead of re-purposing those locations for whatever the current need is , we just cut down more trees and take lands as though it was our to begin with . <h> Disrespect towards animals <p> We never considered the fact that we 're sharing the planet with animals , so when we take up their space , we not only leave these animals without a home , but we also surround ourselves with the products of their environment . <p> And obviously , with no place to go , the animals that survive the vicious taking of their lands will eventually wander into nearby neighbourhoods and towns where they 'll either meet the same fate as the animals that died when the trees fell , or they 'll be caged up in zoos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go , " Hey !

" The world no doubt is being pushed back by this unprecedented pandemic , but the question is , what is the way to a better future ? The only thing that will help secure a better future is education . As Nelson Mandela said , " Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world . " At the moment education is in doldrums . The gates of schools and college are locked . The problems that students face are of three dimensions : The first is psychological . Students are traumatised by the situation of lockdown after lockdown . They also fear for their lives and of their loved ones from the coronavirus . There is yet another element to it : domestic abuse and violence . Gender-based violence , described by the UN as a " shadow pandemic " , has significantly increased during the lockdown . Brown , Brett V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violence in the lives of children " , that children who are exposed to violence at home may have difficulty in learning and limited social skills . They may also exhibit violent , risky or delinquent behaviour , or suffer from depression or severe anxiety . The second is sociological . Students , especially teenagers , ca n't stay focused unless they are connected to their peer group . They excel and are motivated when they are connected to a larger group . The lockdown and frequent snapping of communication has made them lonelier and less motivated . The third is methodological . Technology is being seen as a solution to the current shutdown of academic institutions . Certain private and government schools have already gone online . But there are problems . As per the India Internet 2019 report , there is only 36% IPR ( internet penetration rate ) in India . The IPR is determined by the number of individuals aged above 12 years per 100 population who accessed the internet in the last month . Also , the gender divide is significant with respect to internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to internet . Then there is the disparity among states , e.g. , Delhi NCR has IPR of 69% , followed by Kerala at 54% , but states likes Odisha ( 25% ) , Jharkhand ( 26% ) and Bihar ( 28% ) are at the bottom . Keeping such problems in view , a pragmatic strategy can be drawn . Students should firstly be encouraged to not get bogged down in apprehensions or anxiety but instead look forward to the future . There is no ignoring the fact that the resources are limited as of now , but those who excel are the ones who make the most of the resources available .

@@41935741 <h> George Cooper <h> April 24th , 2020 <h> Chinese state censorship of COVID-19 research represents a looming crisis for academic publishers <p> Issues of censorship surrounding the publication of scholarly research in China have been prominent since a series of press reports and publisher statements revealed that works had been removed from circulation that were deemed sensitive by Chinese buyers . As George Cooper observes , evidence that Chinese authorities are conducting pre-publication vetting of COVID-19 related research , raises new challenges for publishers seeking to distribute open access research papers on this subject , as there is little ground for publishers to remove these papers from their platforms . As publisher commitments to openness collide with their obligations to operate within the legal frameworks of the countries they operate in , it is argued that COVID-19 presages an overdue discussion on the limits of openness in publishing . <p> Earlier this month , the websites of Fudan University and the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan briefly revealed a system of pre-publication vetting of COVID-19 research . If accurate , these regulations could have far-reaching consequences , both for research communities in China , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , revealed requirements for China-based researchers to seek approval from China 's Ministry of Science and Technology before publishing research on the novel coronavirus , with a special emphasis on articles that pinpoint its origins . Publications will be vetted by government officials , who will assess both their ' academic value ' and whether the ' timing for publishing is right , ' raising the spectre of scholarly censorship that routinely shrouds research activities in China . <p> For now , China 's restrictions on COVID-19 research apply only to domestic scholarship . But research in China on COVID-19 is published widely , often in high-impact , English-language journals . Given recent precedents , pre-publication restrictions could signal a shift in focus regarding the post-publication distribution of journal articles by non-Chinese scholarly publishers . In recent years , journal articles on topics such as persecution of the Uighur Muslim ethnic group in Xinjiang , civil unrest in Hong Kong , and the ' three Ts ' -- Tiananmen , Tibet and Taiwan -- have come under intense scrutiny by Chinese state authorities . Cambridge University Press , Springer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2018 , were forced to navigate the demands of the General Administration of Press and Publications , rendering the distribution of research containing sensitive keywords , such as ' Xinjiang ' and ' Cultural Revolution ' , illegal in China . These events led to accusations of censorship complicity , as some publishers took steps to remove or restrict access to sensitive articles on their Chinese-language platforms ; whilst others had entire journals removed from circulation by Chinese research importers for refusing to ' bowdlerize ' their online collections . <p> As has been reported elsewhere , China 's state censors have already used keyword-based targeting to remove posts related to COVID-19 on WeChat , and other social media platforms , including the combinations ' unknown Wuhan pneumonia ' , ' Wuhan seafood market ' and ' Sars variation . ' If similar methods are used to target ' illegal ' COVID-19 research , they will extend beyond the typical targets of state censorship . All the main research publishers are fast-tracking COVID-19 research for publication and distribution on a free-access basis . Unlike previous red-flag topics , concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing body of COVID-19 research cuts across disciplines in the behavioural and medical sciences . Few scientific outputs focus solely on ' non-sensitive ' aspects of the pandemic , as illustrated by recent medical studies that necessarily pinpoint the origins of COVID-19 in Wuhan to give a full picture of its epidemiology . <p> These consequences should be explored and planned for now , before they become a stark reality . Restrictions on the publication and dissemination of research on the COVID-19 outbreak would risk significant financial penalties for publishers that resist , and severe reputational penalties for those that do n't <p> Whilst COVID-19 research circulates freely , seemingly without restriction , this is not solely due to publishers ' philanthropic efforts to serve scholarly communities tackling the global pandemic . Most COVID-19 research outputs are published fully Open Access under Creative Commons licenses . As a document search in Scopus shows , of the 1,799 documents indexed ( to-date ) that feature the term ' COVID-19 ' in their title , abstract and/or text , 1,454 are Open Access . A significant subset of this research has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economic and Social Research Council , the European Commission , and the US 's National Science Foundation , that have mandated full , unrestricted , global access to the published version of record . Of the authors listed against these articles , the largest number ( 577 ) are affiliated with Chinese research institutions , followed by the US ( 379 ) and the UK ( 223 ) . Approximately 30% of authors would have been subject to the new pre-publication checks in China , had they published their research after the new regulations came into force . <p> The censorship demands that publishers faced in 2017 and 2018 concerned scholarship in the social sciences , in paywalled , subscription-access form . Many of the implicated publishers argued , rightly , that they were forced to find routes to comply with China 's censorship demands , as they have no influence over the legal frameworks regarding the sale of publications , or over the purchasing decisions of Chinese research importers . It remains to be seen whether Open Access articles will escape these restrictions , as they 're disseminated freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricting the sale of publications . But equally , state authorities such as the General Administration of Press and Publications could threaten publishers , as they have before , with a ban on the import of their entire output in China , unless suitable amendments are made to their Chinese-language platforms . An unexplored consequence of forcing publishers to comply with censorship demands in the case of Open Access research is that the less censorious route -- refusing to make amendments to the content of journals , prompting importers to remove journals from circulation instead -- would not be available . Publishers would be confronted with a binary choice : remove ' sensitive ' Open Access articles from their Chinese platforms , or risk huge losses of revenues and access for their entire published output . <p> If full , unrestricted , global Open Access is not possible , full disclosure and transparency , where obstacles exist , allows for a better-informed debate on the limits of ' openness ' , which ought to continue beyond the current crisis <p> These consequences should be explored and planned for now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication and dissemination of research on the COVID-19 outbreak would risk significant financial penalties for publishers that resist , and severe reputational penalties for those that do n't . They would represent an apparent conflict between the academic interests of ' openness ' and transparency that publishers aspire towards ( and are in some cases mandated to fulfil ) , whilst operating in increasingly ' closed ' legal frameworks regarding research dissemination . If publishers are again faced with the 99% vs. 1% dilemma by government agencies in China , a response should be coordinated across the industry , via trade bodies such as the STM Association , the Association of University Presses , the International Publishers ' Association , and the Committee on Publication Ethics . <p> The difficulties inherent in balancing principles of Open Access with the reality of China 's legal framework are shared across the scholarly communications industry . As is a shared commitment to the rapid , open dissemination of peer-reviewed research on COVID-19 . These shared challenges and objectives could be an organising principle for a set of industry standards regarding research censorship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent -- as is already the case for retractions , errata and corrigenda . If full , unrestricted , global Open Access is not possible , full disclosure and transparency , where obstacles exist , allows for a better-informed debate on the limits of ' openness ' , which ought to continue beyond the current crisis . The origins of COVID-19 will not be the last ' sensitive ' research topic that faces the sorts of restrictions that have been announced . <p> Note : George Cooper is an employee of the academic publisher , Taylor &amp; Francis .

@@41937841 <p> " Our bags had already been packed by evening of April 13 in the hope of catching the earliest bus leaving for Srikakulam , " said 40-year old Mukunda Rao , recollecting the mood of 200 migrants , all from Srikakulam district . They were expecting for the lockdown to be lifted on April 14 . <p> However , shortly after the extension of the lockdown to May 3 , Rao , alongwith 150 other labourers set off on foot to their villages in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh , 700 kilometres away . They were lucky to get an empty truck . However , as they approached Uppal highway , the police flagged them down and after a two-hour negotiation , sent them back to their single-room rented accommodations in East Marredpally . <p> Over 2,000 migrants from Srikakulam district work as daily wage labourers in the booming construction industry of Hyderabad . Some are masons , while others do tile laying , plastering , painting , and electrical wiring . They hail mainly from Tekkali , Nandigam , Santabommali , Kotabommali , Patapatnam and Palasa villages in Srikakulam ; and rent one-room tenements in East and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent . Every day , they go to the labour adda in the morning , are picked up for work anywhere in the city .

Now they are compelled to borrow at high interest and support us ! " said Chiranjeevi , a young man in his twenties , who works as a mason and earns Rs 800-900 per day . Chiranjeevi , Rao 's cousin , has studied up to intermediate and has been in Secunderabad for the last five years , going home only for special occasions . " It is better for us to go back to the village . We also have to help in farm work back home now , " he added . His wedding , which was to be held on April 25 , has now been postponed too . <p> Rao meanwhile , worked as a mason , and together with his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25,000 rupees in a good month . " There 's no shortage of work throughout the year . But with construction work being halted , we 've had no work come our way for nearly a month , " explained Rao . His wife and he were eager to return to their two children who are in Santabommali village in Srikakulam with their elderly parents . <p> Unlike the thekedars or builders whom the government asked to support the labourers affiliated to them with cash and/or ration , the skilled Srikakulam labourers were practically left holding their implements as their livelihood meant being picked up work from the labour adda , where each day 's work is with a different contractor . <p> Most labourers come to work in Hyderabad and Secunderabad as seasonal migrants for eight months in a year , and they return with Rs 1.5 lakh earnings on average , said Avala Khagesh , president of the year-old Greater Hyderabad Outside Gova Union . Gova means scaffolding in the local language . <p> Khagesh said that roughly three lakh labourers from Andhra Pradesh are working in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union 's 12 branches across the city . Wards five and six of Marredpally area of Secunderabad have 2,700 Srikakulam labourers . " We were actually getting ready to negotiate better wages and conditions when this coronavirus problem came along , bringing up a host of new issues . " <p> The current situation , and little assistance <p> " Each small tenement of a 10-squarefoot room with a makeshift kitchen is shared by six to seven labourers -- either families or single men , " Khagesh said . " After the COVID-19 outbreak , the owners began limiting occupancy to just two persons per room , triggering panic departures . And those left behind are desperate without any earnings , with rents to pay , and new conditions from landlords . They had no help from anywhere . " <p> Khagesh had contacted G Sayanna , Member of Legislative Assembly ( MLA ) from Secunderabad Cantonment , sharing their concerns about lack of work , new problems of accommodation , no wages or rations for them to survive . The MLA asked them to contact the Mandal Revenue Officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On March 31 , the Telangana government announced through an order that migrant labourers are entitled to 12 kg rice and Rs 500 cash . However , the promised ration did not reach them till April 14 and the looming extension of the lockdown until May 3 left them with no option but to head back home . <p> Sunil Nathani , Marredpally Mandal Revenue Officer ( MRO ) , explained the technical issues in supporting the labourers from Srikakulam with ration . " As per the government order ( GO 13 ) , all labourers from outside the state of Telangana are eligible for 12 kg rice and Rs 500 cash , however , the case of the Srikakulam labourers was different . " <p> " Most of the labourers have spent over seven to 10 years here , earn well and do not fall in the strict definition of ' migrant worker ' . In a rapid survey conducted in Marredpally 's eight different ' labour addas ' during the first phase of lockdown , i.e. , until 14 April , the Revenue Department identified 645 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Srikakulam labourers were found eligible for this relief , " he revealed . The Tehsil office distributed 12 kg rice and Rs 500 to all those labourers . <p> " However , as the matter of Srikakulam labourers ( the instance of their staging a walk back to their village ) came to light , a more in-depth survey was conducted in the second phase which helped them identify 950 labourers in the Tehsil , which included 450 labourers from Srikakulam , " Sunil added . <p> He sounded surprised at the Union 's claim of the presence of 2,000 labourers . " If the Tehsil office has still left out migrants eligible for support , we are willing to consider them favourably , " he said , when asked if the second survey could have further missed several labourers . <p> Lack of administrative coordination <p> One of the biggest challenges with migrant workers is getting the exact number , said Dr Usha Seethalakshmi , an independent researcher and member Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch ( MAKAAM ) , a national forum that works with women farmers and workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labour department website records 15,45,845 labourers in the state , including 6,23,714 women . However , as per GO 13 , the state came up with the figure of 3,35,669 labourers . <p> " This is a gross underestimate of migrant workers given the phenomenal growth of real estate , irrigation infrastructure in the state , especially in the last six years , " observed Seethalakshmi . " Most obviously the allocation of 12 kg rice and Rs 500 cash will be inadequate , " she added . <p> Acknowledging the difficulty of recording data of migrant labourers in a city like Hyderabad , especially the 650 square kilometres of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( GHMC ) area , Ravinder Reddy , the Deputy Commissioner of Labour for Hyderabad-1 said that the discrepancies arise from lack of coordination amongst departments . <p> During COVID-19 response , GHMC , Revenue Department and Labour Department , all came out with their own separate lists of migrant workers . The Revenue Department 's first list of migrant workers in Hyderabad city alone showed a figure of 34,000 workers ; a second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final consolidated list of all surveys by all departments established 84,000 workers . As per the government order , 12 kg of rice each and Rs 500 were distributed to some 60,000 workers . For the rest , the distribution is still ongoing , informed Reddy . This , on April 22 , almost a month after the lockdown began on 24 March . <p> Contractors not following norms hurts workers <p> The real estate boom in Hyderabad , actively promoted by the state government , has attracted large numbers of skilled and unskilled interstate , and in much larger numbers intrastate , migrant workers . <p> Every contractor is expected to register under the Building and Other Construction Workers ' Act , 1966 ( BCOW ) , explained Seethalakshmi . The Central Act , binding on builders and contractors , was enacted with the objective of ensuring the safety , security and regulating the working conditions of the workers . But most builders and contractors evade registration of workers and payment of cess -- one percent of the cost of construction -- towards workers ' welfare fund , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in as part of a larger policy framework of ' ease of doing business ' -- and the inspections by the labour department made non-mandatory for an enabling environment , has allowed builders and contractors to get away with several violations , " explained Seethalakshmi . <p> According to COVID-19 Advocacy Lockdown Collective , a collective of social activists , the Telangana government has collected Rs 1,201 crore as cess towards workers ' welfare fund and as of December 31 , 2018 , and has spent only Rs 263 crore . In a letter addressed to the Chief Minister dated 12 April , the Collective urged the government to extend a one-time financial assistance of Rs 2500 , in addition to the 12 kg rice and Rs 500 to workers , using this fund . To minimise the distress , it appealed for immediate payment of all pending claims of workers from the welfare fund , along with the wages due to them , to arrange for their safe transit , accommodation with adequate sanitation , and cr ? che facilities for children . <p> As the government struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to hit the road . Some are turned back , but many managed , almost , to reach their homes . <p> The yearning to go home <p> " We were not the first batch of labourers to start our journey back home , " said Mukunda Rao . Out of the 2,000 labourers in the East Marredpally area , 200 had already left for home in the previous week in smaller batches , said Rao . <p> Rama Rao , Rani , and several others were relatively lucky to have jumped past Telangana border , but they have still not reached home to be with their families as they had desired . <p> 35-year-old Rama Rao along with his wife Rani and nine others had left their single-room tenement in East Marredpally at about 10 am on April 12 .

All of them were off-loaded there . After gathering their details , the police sent them to Vizag city in the same truck , where they were detained at the MRO office for two days . The police then collected the names and other details of everyone and sent them on a state transport bus to Srikakulam , to a degree college to be quarantined , where Rama Rao and Rani are presently lodged . <p> " The place is big , but there are too many people in every room .

There seem to be some doctors downstairs but no one has come so far to check us , but they are saying a test will be done on April 25 , " Rama Rao said . <p> Despite being quarantined 45 kilometres away from Srikakulam , Rama Rao and Rani were happy to be closer home than in Hyderabad , thankful they have their phones to stay in touch with their children and elderly mother . <p> Padmaja Shaw is a retired professor of Journalism from Osmania University and Malini Subramaniam is an independent journalist .

@@41943841 <p> A preliminary study has found the first evidence of a link between higher levels of air pollution and deaths from Covid-19 in England . <p> The analysis showed London , the Midlands and the north-west had the highest levels of nitrogen oxides and higher numbers of coronavirus deaths . <p> The research has not yet been peer-reviewed and shows only a correlation . The scientists behind the study said more research was needed to confirm a causal link and rule out other possible factors such as income levels and any difference in age profiles in the regions . <p> But they said there was an urgent need to share information about the pandemic . Previous research showed air pollution increased deaths during the Sars outbreak in 2003 , and long-term exposure to dirty air is well known to damage lung health . <p> " Our study adds to growing evidence from northern Italy and the US that high levels of air pollution are linked to deadlier cases of Covid-19 , " said Miguel Martins , of the University of Cambridge , who led the new analysis . <p> " This is something we saw during the Sars outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a detrimental effect on the prognosis of patients in China .

Physical distancing can mean total lockdowns and curfews , or it can mean school closures or flexible work arrangements , or closing of bars and entertainment venues , but keeping restaurants open , or variations thereof , " Leung said , speaking earlier this month . <p> " Given those three dials , you need to find your combination that is contextually acceptable but also would be able to give you health protection , economic preservation and social acceptance .

As a middling KGB apparatchik in Dresden in 1989 he saw the USSR 's authority over its empire collapse along with its economy . Two years later , the Soviet state itself imploded , unable to feed its citizens or command the loyalty of its own security forces . Rebuilding Russia 's security apparatus back to Soviet levels and securing it against another systemic collapse has been the touchstone of Putin 's two decades in power . <p> With the coronavirus crisis , the Putin system faces a stress test every bit as radical as that which brought down Mikhail Gorbachev . The proximate cause of the USSR 's collapse was a 1985 decision by the Saudis -- with American encouragement -- to crash the price of oil . Without a steady supply of oil profit to keep the state running , the true dysfunction and rottenness of the Soviet economy was revealed . Yegor Gaidar , architect of Russia 's first post-communist economic reforms , compared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as sufficient water pours into it , nobody notices the holes . Reduce the flow , and the leaks become more apparent , until the bucket drains to the bottom . That is the point that the people rise . <p> Modern Russia 's economic bucket is also full of holes -- albeit different ones from those caused by the gross inefficiencies of the Soviet command economy . Putin 's Russia is characterised by wholesale theft at every level of the state bureaucracy -- estimated by the independent Indem Foundation in Moscow at a full third of GDP . State employees , from regional governors to firemen , have become a vast parasitic class that preys on the incomes of private businesses . And despite lip-service to diversifying the economy , oil and gas still account for more than half of Russian exports . <p> To date , neither corruption nor abuse of power have been able to dent Putin 's popularity seriously . The Kremlin has been able to ride out previous oil price falls in 2008 and again in 2014 by prudently saving windfall oil money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its value in the aftermath of Putin 's annexation of Crimea in 2014 , the government banned the import of foodstuffs from the EU -- boosting the local economy and ensuring that citizens ' devalued rubles would hold their local purchasing power . <p> But with the coronavirus , the regime faces a double whammy . Not only have oil prices fallen to levels not seen since the early Yeltsin years , but Russia 's harsh corona lockdown is also set to devastate the small- and medium-size businesses which make up an estimated 42 per cent of the economy . And while the UK and other western nations can finance their post-corona financial stimulus packages by either printing money or borrowing it , Putin has no such recourse . The economic sanctions that followed Crimea have cut Russian private companies off from international money markets almost entirely -- while Russian sovereign debt is only attractive when underpinned by healthy oil revenues . <p> Putin 's response to the crisis has been telling . He 's ordered an oppressive raft of lockdown measures , ostentatiously sent planeloads of medical aid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political scene .

Lawbreakers are arrested -- including , notoriously , an old lady who did not own a mobile phone , whose violent arrest went viral on social media . Even dog-walking is restricted to a hundred metres from home . The lockdown itself may be no more strict than Italy 's -- but the police response has been far more aggressive . <p> Much more sinister is a Chinese-style crackdown on critics of the state 's corona response . One prominent whistle-blower is Anastasia Vasilieva , the head of Russia 's Alliance of Doctors , who has claimed that Russia 's cases -- 747 dead as of 25 April -- are being deliberately under-reported . ' The situation is being covered up , ' Vasilieva wrote in her popular blog .

' Last month police beat up Vasilieva and accused her of violating lockdown rules as she and a team of volunteers delivered protective gear to a hospital outside of Moscow . <p> The Alliance of Doctors , an independent NGO , has been inundated with requests for help from desperate hospital staff , complaining bitterly about having no protective equipment or medical supplies to help them treat Covid-19 patients . Yet in March , Russia sent several military aircraft loaded with personal protective equipment and 122 military doctors to Bergamo , Italy -- landing at Rome , rather than a closer airport , in order to extract maximum PR value from the spectacle of Putin coming to the aid of stricken Europeans . According to Russia 's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , the aid had been requested by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte after his pleas for help from other EU states had been rebuffed . <p> Meanwhile , the usually omnipresent Putin has been curiously absent from the nation 's TV screens . Instead Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost unknown tax minister who was appointed in January -- have taken the lead , and the flak , in enforcing the lockdown .

If his lieutenants succeed , he can step in to take the credit -- or if they fail , step in to noisily fire them . <p> There are already signs of discontent . On 20 April in the North Caucasian city of Vladikavkaz , a protest by 2,000 people over job losses was violently broken up by riot police . A petition from owners of small and medium-sized businesses appealing to the government for help with mass bankruptcies has gained more than 300,000 signatures . Economists now predict the worst recession since the collapse of the USSR , with a rise in the unemployment rate to 15 per cent that could leave as many as eight million jobless . <p> In some ways , Putin is better placed to ride out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund stands at $570 billion , up $190 billion since 2014 . That should go some way to covering coronavirus bailout measures announced by Central Bank chairman Elvira Nabiullina -- starting with an initial $81 million package of loans to private business . And in the long term , low oil prices are set to drive US shale oil companies out of business , which will ultimately be good news for Russian producers . <p> But Russia 's 2019-20 budget balances at an oil price of $45 a barrel . With current prices at $21 , the Kremlin faces a serious financial shortfall -- without even accounting for the massive costs of propping up Russia 's coronavirus-stalled economy , which Putin 's former finance minister Alexei Kudrin estimates will take a stimulus spend of some 7 per cent of GDP . <p> The unspoken grand bargain between Putin and the Russian people that has underpinned his success was that he would deliver prosperity and national greatness in exchange for their surrendering democratic freedoms and turning a blind eye to the corruption of the Kremlin 's cronies .

In the 19th century , exposure to copper would have been an early version of constantly sanitizing one 's hands . <p> Since then , studies have shown that copper is able to destroy the microbes that most threaten our lives . It has been shown to kill a long list of microbes , including norovirus , MRSA , a staph bacteria that has become resistant to antibiotics , virulent strains of E. coli that cause food-borne illness , and coronaviruses -- possibly including the novel strain currently causing the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> If copper were more frequently used in hospitals , where 1 in 31 people get healthcare-acquired infections ( HAI ) , or in high-traffic areas , where many people touch surfaces teeming with microbial life -- it could play an invaluable role in public health , said Michael Schmidt , a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Medical University of South Carolina , who studies copper . And yet , it is woefully absent from our public spaces , healthcare settings , and homes . <p> " What happened is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials took over , " Schmidt said of the cheaper products more frequently used . " We moved away from copper beds , copper railings , and copper door knobs to stainless steel , plastic , and aluminum . " <p> Watch more from VICE : <p> Many of the microbes that make us sick can live on hard surfaces for up to four or five days . When we touch those surfaces , the microbes can make it into our bodies through our nose , mouth , or eyes , and infect us . <p> On copper surfaces , bacteria and viruses die . When a microbe lands on a copper surface , the copper releases ions , which are electrically charged particles . Those copper ions blast through the outer membranes and destroy the whole cell , including the DNA or RNA inside . Because their DNA and RNA are destroyed , it also means a bacteria or virus ca n't mutate and become resistant to the copper , or pass on genes ( like for antibiotic resistance ) to other microbes . <p> Before people even knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could -- somehow -- ward off infection . The first recorded medical use of copper is from one of the oldest-known books , the Smith Papyrus , written between 2600 and 2200 B.C. It said that copper was used to sterilize chest wounds and drinking water . Egyptian and Babylonian soldiers would similarly put the shavings from their bronze swords ( made from copper and tin ) into their open wounds to reduce infections . A more contemporary use of copper : In New York City 's Grand Central Station , the grand staircase is flanked by copper handrails . " Those are actually anti-microbial , " Schmidt said . <p> The copper smelters were , ostensibly , exposed to less of the cholera bacterium because their surroundings included a lot of copper that bacteria could n't live on . That and they potentially were covered in copper particles . If metallurgy does n't call to you , there are now some products that are advertised as " copper hand sanitizers , " but they work only if you can expose every surface of your hands to the copper for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the copper surface to be killed . It could be difficult to get to every part of your skin 's surface , so having copper surfaces in your environment paired with handwashing would be the ideal combination . <p> Schmidt said that using copper along with standard hygiene protocols has been shown to reduce bacteria in health care settings by 90 percent . A study from 1983 found that hospital door knobs made of brass , which is part copper , barely had any E. coli growth on them , compared to stainless steel knobs which were " heavily colonized . " This is significant because of how rampant healthcare-acquired infections are : In the U.S. alone , there are about 1.7 million infections and 99,000 deaths linked to HAIs per year , which cost between $35.7 and $45 billion annually , from the extra treatments people need when they get infected . <p> Microbes that live on surfaces in patient rooms and common spaces in hospitals play a role in getting a HAI -- and this is where copper could help . And during this pandemic , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus via contaminated surfaces , a virus-killing substance seems worthwhile indeed . <p> A study from 2015 found that a different coronavirus , human coronavirus 229E , which causes respiratory tract infections , could still infect a human lung cell after five days of being on materials like teflon , ceramic , glass , silicone rubber , and stainless steel . But on copper alloys , the coronavirus was " rapidly inactivated . " <p> In a new preprint on SARS-CoV2 , the strain that causes COVID-19 , researchers at the National Institutes of Health virology laboratory in Montana sprayed the virus onto seven different common materials , reported MIT Technology Review . They found that it survived the longest -- up to three days -- on plastic and stainless steel , suggesting that surfaces in hospitals or steel poles on public transit could be places where people pick up the illness . Just a single droplet from a cough or sneeze can carry an infectious dose of a virus . <p> Bill Keevil , a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton in England who has previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if copper surfaces were put in communal areas where many people gather , it could help reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses , like coronavirus 229E and also SARS-CoV2 . Other than hospitals , he thinks the ideal locations for copper are public transportation systems , like buses , airports , subways . But he does n't stop there : He would also like to see copper used in sports equipment in gyms , like weights , along with other everyday objects , including shared office supplies , like pens . <p> In the preprint , SARS-CoV2 " liked copper least , " Antonio Regalado wrote in MIT Technology Review . " The virus was gone after just four hours . " <p> In 2012 , Schmidt and his colleagues ran a clinical trial in three hospitals , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City , Medical University of South Carolina , in Charleston , and Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Administration Medical Center , also in Charleston . <p> First , they figured out which items closest to a patient were the most contaminated with microbes -- those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm of the visitor chair , the tray tables , and the IV pole . Enveloping these items in copper reduced the presence of microbes by 83 percent . As a result , HAIs were reduced by 58 percent , even though the researchers had introduced copper to less than 10 percent of the surface area of the room . <p> We have other methods of killing bacteria and viruses to mitigate HAIs , including ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide gas . But both require a hospital room to be empty , and once sick people re-enter rooms , surfaces can easily be contaminated again . " Copper is continuously working 24/7 without supervision , without any need to intervene , and it never runs out , " Schmidt said . " As long as the metal 's there , it 's good to go . " <p> So given how well it could work , for hospital infections and for health more generally , why is n't copper everywhere ? Why is n't every door knob , every subway rail , every ICU room , made of copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not copper ? Where are the copper iPhone cases ? <p> It does n't seem like we 'll run out of copper in the near future , according to the World Copper Factbook from 2019 . Copper is one of the most recycled of all metals -- nearly all copper can be recycled and not lose any of its properties . <p> There might also be a perception that copper is too expensive , Schmidt said , despite the fact that the numbers indicate it would ultimately save money . One of Keevil and Schmidt 's studies from 2015 did the math : The cost of treating an HAI ranges from $28,400 to $33,800 per patient . Installing copper on 10 percent of surfaces cost $52,000 and prevented 14 infections over the course of the 338-day study . If you take the lower end of the HAI treatment cost ( $28,400 ) , then those 14 prevented infections saved a total of $397,600 , or $1,176 a day . <p> Even when factoring in how much the copper cost initially , you 'd make that money back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the copper never loses its microbial killing abilities -- hospitals would quickly be saving money ( and lives ) . <p> " Your payback is literally in less than two prevented infections , " he said . " I really struggle with this . Since 2013 , I have been literally begging , groveling , pleading , with any and all concerned to make a completely copper encapsulated hospital bed . " <p> He recently did convince a company to invest , and said they 're in the process of testing it to show that it could reduce infections even further than 58 percent . <p> Another reason copper may have been passed over for steel , plastic , or glass is that it can easily tarnish and requires a lot of cleaning to remain shiny . " But copper is antimicrobial regardless of how grody it looks , if it turns green on you , it still has the ability to kill bacteria and viruses and fungi , " he said . <p> He said that one of the reasons scientists are worried about the current coronavirus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be getting it is from touching contaminated surfaces . He thinks it 's possible that the pandemic could raise awareness for copper -- if it motivates anyone to start using it . Imagine , he said , if our hospitals and public spaces already had copper in place -- it 's impossible to say for sure , but it 's likely that transmission would have been affected . <p> " I have great confidence that it would work because bacteria or viruses are the ones causing the infection , " he said . " If their numbers go down , common sense would tell you : you should have fewer infections . "
@@51584841 <p> I 'm getting tired of exageration in articles . The first one on cleaning is over the top . Unless you have someone infected in the home it is not necessary to use a fresh hand towel for every hand wash or paper towels . If afraid of bringing it in the house by all means wash hands and put the towel in the laundry but the coronavirus ca n't get into your home unless you or someone else brings it in . I suppose someone could cough into an open window but that is unlikely . <p> Where does it say you have to replace the towel every time ? I could not find that . It says have stacks of clean towels or paper towels . When you wash your hands in the house use the same towel . When you go out and come back in use that towel once and then replace it .

Wipe everything coming in with soap or lysol etc ( or place in a box you do not touch for 10 days ) . <p> This is not an exaggeration . This is how to be safe . <p> The problem is people not taking this seriously enough -- not people being too stringent . <p> This YouTube stream is constantly updating the latest figures from all countries , plus it has a slideshow of various charts and graphs , all with a quiet , ambient sound track . It can be quite hypnotizing , at least to me . As if this moment , it shows Canada at 924 cases . <p> BC is fortunate to have a very forthright and knowledgeable Public Health Officer . She has the legal authority to order people indoors and have it enforced . For now she is trying the social distancing approach but methinks that we are going to get stricter rules in the next few days as the cases rise . <p> Of interest in BC during the Spanish flu there was no Public Health Authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take other measures . One of the lessons learnt was it had to be provincial not local because many people just ignored it . Go online and search for images of the November 11 , 1918 celebrations in Canada , then think about the fact that most of the country was supposedly under quarantine of some sort or other . <p> But Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry made clear today that while everyone is encouraged to get outdoors for fresh air -- if people do n't start following her voluntary directives , she 'll have no choice but to impose orders . <p> " This is not business as usual , " she said during her daily briefing on the pandemic today , March 19 . She stressed the need for everyone to follow the rules of social distancing and not meeting in larger groups . <p> " We are , obviously , watching this very carefully , " she said . " I ca n't say it enough . This is not optional . This is for everybody and we do have the legal authority to enforce it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep those distances between us , " she said . " While we need to keep essential services going , we need to make sure that we 're able to get the groceries that we need and sometimes hardware that we need if we have issues in our home -- but , right now , is a time we want everybody to lay low . " <p> ... <p> Anyways this is great info that applies across the country . <p> Here are the basic Dos and Don'ts of social distancing , as advised by the Public Health Agency of Canada and chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam : <p> DO <p> Stay home as much as possible . <p> Get fresh air , go for a jog or walk your dog but always keep two metres ( six feet or about two arms-lengths ) distance from other people . <p> Go to the grocery store or pharmacy as needed but keep the two-metre distance and wash your hands upon your return home . Shopping online and arranging to have things dropped off at your home is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water for at least 20 seconds , especially after using the washroom and when preparing food . The extra scrubbing time matters . Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are n't available . <p> Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the bend of your arm , not your hand . Dispose of any tissues as soon as possible in a lined wastebasket and wash your hands afterwards . <p> Use technology to keep in touch with people at higher risk like the elderly or those in poor health . Avoid personal contact . <p> DON'TS <p> Avoid non-essential gatherings . That means no visits with your neighbours or friends , no play dates , no sleepovers , no parties and especially no public gatherings in crowded spaces , like conferences , concerts or sporting events ( if there are any on ) . <p> Avoid public transportation or , if you must use it , travel at uncrowded hours . <p> The technology exists to enforce quarantines using cellphone tower information . This is the time to use such technology . <p> As for rights there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The right to privacy at times can be compromised by a need arising from the right to safety . Absolute rights do not exist becuase one person 's right interacts with another . This is the same situation when it comes to hate speech - we balance the right not to be subjected to hate against the right to speech and we outlaw hate speech . Rights , since they are not absolutes have to arbitrated fairly in the interest of people . This is a time when we are confronted with the need to have more sophisticated and less simplistic assertions of rights . <p> The cruise industry has failed miserably during the crisis Apart from not shutting down nowhere near early enough there are obviously huge hygiene issues on their ships This is apart from their global warming aspects <p> That all seems pretty sensible .

The most recent survey , taken on March 16 and 17 , found that , as a group , the experts think that as March 15 , only 12 percent of infections in the U.S. had been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

@@51587741 <h> CERB , EI Or Wage Subsidy ? What COVID-19 Financial Assistance Do You Qualify For ? <h> Emergency benefits and employment insurance and subsidies -- there 's a lot to unpack . <p> As we settle into a new month of life in the coronavirus pandemic , more and more details are emerging about the financial assistance available to Canadians impacted by the spread of COVID-19 . <p> Last week , the federal government unveiled a huge financial relief package aimed at stimulating the economy and supporting Canadians who have been laid off because of the pandemic . A big feature of that package was the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit ( CERB ) , a $2,000 monthly payment available to Canadian workers impacted by COVID-19 layoffs . It comes on top of existing programs like employment insurance ( EI ) and new benefits at the provincial level . <p> On Wednesday , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released further details on the CERB and announced that applications would open on April 6 . He called the financial support package -- including the CERB and new wage subsidy program -- the " largest economic program in Canada 's history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civic mobilization since the Second World War , " Trudeau said . <p> Big government mobilizations come with big questions . So here 's what you need to know . <h> Can I apply for both the CERB and EI ? <p> No , not at the same time . The CERB is designed to fill in some of the gaps in the existing EI structure and shoulder some of the application load . <p> But that does n't mean the $2,000 a month from the CERB is the only benefit you have access to . Provinces are rolling out supports of their own , including B.C. 's $500 renter relief fund and Ontario 's $200 one-time child support payment . Many also have financial relief specifically for people directed to self-isolate if they are sick or caring for someone who is sick -- in Alberta it 's a one-time payment of $1,146 . <p> Canada has n't seen this type of civic mobilization since the Second World War.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <p> If you are still out of work when your CERB payments run out , you can apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have a full-time job . What benefits do I have access to ? <p> Great ! In this case , if your employer is struggling they can apply for the 75 per cent wage subsidy recently announced by the federal government , if they qualify . More details on that here . <h> I was laid off because of COVID-19 and already applied for EI <p> Then hang tight -- according to the government either your application for EI will be processed or you 'll be put into the queue for the CERB . Stay tuned for updates through your EI portal or My CRA account . <p> On Wednesday , Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough said there has been an " unprecedented wave " of more than 2.1 million EI applications in the past two weeks . <h> I am not working because of COVID-19 and HAVE NOT applied for EI yet <p> The federal government is suggesting that you wait until applications for the CERB open on April 6 , as that is likely to be processed faster than EI . <p> You can apply for the CERB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . Starting April 6 , the government is recommending that people stagger their application by birth month in order to avoid overwhelming the system . <p> January , February , March : April 6 , Mondays after that <p> April , May , June : April 7 , Tuesdays after that <p> July , August , September : April 8 , Wednesdays after that <p> October , November , December : April 9 , Thursdays after that <p> People with any birth month can apply Fridays , Saturdays and Sundays . <p> WATCH : Trudeau boosts wage subsidy . Story continues below . <p> Both online and phone applications are available 21 hours a day , seven days a week . Both services are closed from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m . EST for maintenance . <p> You qualify for the CERB if you were laid off because of COVID-19 , had at least $5,000 in income in the past year and expect to be without employment for at least 14 days of the next month . <p> If you qualify , you 'll be approved for a one-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cheque in the mail or through direct deposit . If you continue to be unemployed , you can reapply each month for that $2,000 up to four months total . <h> I was laid off because of COVID-19 , but still have some income from another job <p> This is where it gets tricky . According to government releases , the CERB is intended for people who have no employment income for at least 14 days of the first pay period ( which is a month ) and can prove no income in subsequent pay periods to continue receiving the benefit . <p> Adrian Wyld/THE CANADIAN PRESSMinister of Finance Bill Morneau responds to a question during a news conference in Ottawa on March 27 , 2020 . <p> So if you are still employed or self-employed and receiving income , you technically do not qualify . You may qualify for other provincial benefits , such as B.C. 's rent subsidy , but will have to check your respective jurisdiction . <h> I was unemployed before COVID-19 <p> If you qualify for EI , you can still apply for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were out of work before all of this , neither the CERB nor EI will cover you . <p> According to the government 's CERB application : " The Benefit is only available to individuals who stopped work and are not earning employment or self-employment income as a result of reasons related to COVID-19 . If you have not stopped working because of COVID-19 , you are not eligible for the Benefit . " <p> The government gives the example of an unemployed student who is potentially seeking out summer employment -- if you were n't laid off because of COVID-19 and did n't make the minimum amount of money last year to qualify for EI , you do n't qualify . <h> I was laid off because of COVID-19 and plan to stay unemployed ( retire ) <p> Technically , you can apply for the CERB , since , unlike EI , there is no indication by the government that you need to prove that you are actively looking for work . <p> However , you can only receive the CERB for up to four months and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were laid off because of COVID-19 , not because you were already retiring . <h> How do I prove I was laid off because of COVID-19 ? <p> The most important document is a Record of Employment ( ROE ) from your previous employer , which shows when you were laid off and why . If the business you worked for shut down or downsized in response to the pandemic , the likely reason listed on your ROE is " shortage of work . " <h> Could my employer who laid me off rehire me now that there 's a wage subsidy ? <p> " My message to Canada 's employers is this : Get ready to rehire people , " he said . <p> The wage subsidy will cost the government an estimated $71 billion . Employers will be eligible if they see a reduction of at least 30 per cent in revenues , compared to the same month last year .

Over a six-month period , 375 cases were recorded in the province , with 44 deaths . <p> The researchers from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency , which falls under the U.S. Department of Defense , were drawn to the GTA because of the estimated 26,000 to 30,000 people who spent time in quarantine in the York , Durham and Toronto regions . Of those thousands , only 68 were issued mandatory quarantine orders from public health officials , and only one of those orders involved the Toronto Police . With an eye to future pandemic planning , the researchers wanted to know what motivated so many people to comply , and what factors made it difficult ? There was a mix of health-care workers and members of the general population in the study , and the majority said they were motivated by civic duty -- a desire to protect the community , family and friends from the virus . " Fear of running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the study noted . <p> " I think the most important lesson that came out of that study ... was that compliance with quarantine really has to be a community effort , " lead author Dr. Clete DiGiovanni said from his California home , adding that employers and government need to be key players . " People in quarantine , even though they are in quarantine so that they are away from others , they really need the help of others to comply ... for any prolonged period of time . " <p> Those who studied SARS knew there were lessons to learn -- not just because Ontario was caught so unprepared , but because many believed a major pandemic was overdue . <p> " History has not been kind to Cassandra or Chicken Little .

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed life in Toronto in a way SARS did not , shuttering the city aside from services deemed essential . Case counts are rising , and so is the death toll , including worrying outbreaks in long-term care homes . As sunny weather brings more of the self-isolating masses outside , Mayor John Tory has pleaded with people to respect the closure of city dog parks , playgrounds and park amenities .

In both cases , the effort depends on public co-operation , which depends on confidence in leadership . People need to believe in the information they 're receiving from officials , and trust that decisions are being made because of independent medical evidence , and not bureaucratic , financial or political expediency . <p> Hunt believes that trust exists right now .

" SARS took everything out of me , " he said . <p> By late March , Toronto public health officials were investigating 15 probable and five suspected cases , trying to get a handle on the emerging threat .

Public health authorities publicized places and times where exposure had been likely , asking people to call in to register for quarantine . And people did . <p> While England was in hospital , his wife quarantined at home . And then when he returned , he began his own period of isolation . Three public health departments were involved because he acquired SARS in Toronto , lived in Durham , and his family doctor was in York .

They had seen what the virus was capable of , DiGiovanni said , and they desperately wanted to protect their loved ones . <p> Challenges for people in quarantine included boredom , stress , stigma , isolation , and logistics .

He relied on family and friends from work to drop off supplies , shovel his driveway , and cut his grass . " They looked after me , " he said . " I think that 's why I recovered as well as I did .

" The question again has to be asked , how long can that go on ? " <p> The U.S. researchers concluded that while quarantine compliance among GTA residents " appeared high " during SARS , that sense of civic duty and social responsibility might not be as significant in other countries and cultures . <p> Doug Hunt remembers a meeting with U.S. Centers for Disease Control officials in Atlanta in late 2003 . One of the officials said they were n't sure if there would be the same kind of public co-operation in the United States because of American traditions of " aggressive civil liberties . " <p> " As I watched events unfold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of the comment he made , " he said . <p> " Like many others , I have elderly people who I adore more than anything in the world and other family members who are at risk , and I understand how concerning this disease is for us all , " he wrote on Instagram . <p> DiGiovanni , now retired , said messaging in the United States has been framed very personally : If we all have loved ones who are vulnerable and at risk , we should not feel immune from the responsibility of protecting them . <p> " That seems to be a message that is getting through with the exception of dunderheads like the person you were quoting who was frolicking in the sand and sun and immune to logic , " he said . <p> From his home in Scarborough , Bruce England is worried that people are n't taking the advice to stay home seriously enough . Because it 's not just Florida beaches that attract a crowd . When he has to venture out for medical appointments , England has noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " more people than I think necessary . " He understands why people are torn , especially those who need to be at work , and those who are hurting financially , but " if we do n't get a stop to it , " he said , " people are going to die . " <p> In the course of his investigation into Ontario 's experience with SARS , Justice Archie Campbell and his team interviewed around 1,000 people , including medical personnel , first responders , front-line workers , government officials , people who contracted SARS , and people who had lost loved ones . Campbell was insightful with his investigation , and prescient with his recommendations , Hunt said . <p> " As difficult a time as this is , as bleak looking as it might be , we have such a debt of gratitude that we owe to him , " Hunt said . <p> One of the lasting hallmarks was the emphasis on the " precautionary principle " -- the idea that action to reduce risk should not wait for scientific certainty . Campbell pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Those who argued against the N95 , which protects against airborne transmission , believed SARS was spread mostly by large droplets , " he wrote . " They made this argument even though knowledge about SARS and about airborne transmission was still evolving . " <p> " When it comes to worker safety in hospitals , we should not be driven by the scientific dogma of yesterday or even the scientific dogma of today , " he continued . " We should be driven by the precautionary principle that reasonable steps to reduce risk should not await scientific certainty . Until this precautionary principle is fully recognized , mandated and enforced in Ontario 's hospitals , workers will continue to be at risk . " <p> When asked about the precautionary principle , a spokesperson with the Ministry of Health wrote that when little was known about the transmission of COVID-19 , the ministry recommended " on a precautionary basis " droplet/contact and airborne precautions . <p> Now they say evidence is clear that it is a " droplet/contact spread virus , " with " no evidence " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest the virus is " mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air . " <p> " As this outbreak evolves , we will continue to review the scientific evidence to understand the most appropriate guidance for the health system and make updates as needed , " ministry spokesperson Sonya Igneski wrote in an email . <p> A group of " medical leaders " at Michael Garron Hospital organized a personal protective equipment drive to " support anticipated shortage . " Similar efforts are happening across the province . The Ontario government has a website asking people to submit their ideas and information about supplies they have . <p> Any issue that causes people to question the motivation behind directives can cause cracks in public trust , Doug Hunt said . He mentions Ontario 's expired stockpile of millions of N95 respirators , the federal shipment of emergency medical supplies to China in February , the emerging debate about whether the public should be wearing masks , and the lack of aggressive warnings to avoid travel in early March . People need to have confidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . When officials state something emphatically , they need to be sure of what they 're saying . It they 're not sure , they need to say so . <p> While he investigated Ontario 's response to the SARS crisis , Justice Archie Campbell was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and , later , cancer . Those on the inquiry team remember him coming in to work with a supply of oxygen , never complaining . " Watching him write that report with the personal health burdens he had , he became one of my heroes , " Doug Hunt said . " I 'll never forget it . " <p> Campbell was 65 when he died in April 2007 , three months after the final report was released . <p> " He did n't want any other families to suffer as those families suffered , " said Mario Possamai , senior advisor with the commission . " He did n't want nurses to be going through what they 're going through today . " <p> The research into the SARS response was done to " lay out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Possamai said . " I did n't think in my wildest dreams if we faced a pandemic , we would be as badly organized as we are today with respect to lab testing and N95s , " he said . <p> As he contemplates the lessons from SARS , Doug Hunt said there are a couple of things that give him hope . There has been public co-operation so far , but " it 's going to require a war footing type of resolve , " he said . He is also hopeful about all the resources being poured into this problem as the world races to find a vaccine and useful antiviral medications . <p> From Scarborough , the now-retired Bruce England is worried about proper protection for health-care workers . When it comes to leadership , he thinks the premier and public health officials are doing a good job so far . " That 's a saving grace for us now , " he says . <p> Rick Huffman , a retired Toronto police officer who was a senior investigator with the SARS commission , says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us an awful lot . " Speaking from his Paris , Ont. home , he flips through the weighty final report looking for a specific passage from Campbell , where he called the public heroes for their co-operation . <p> " If not for them , " Huffman said , " everything was going to go down the tubes . " <p> He believes the province 's experience with SARS made us better prepared to face this pandemic . If COVID-19 had happened 17 years ago , he said , " we would have been in dire , dire straits . " <p> In his final report , Justice Archie Campbell called public support the " bedrock " of any effective emergency response . Mario Possamai believes Toronto had it in 2003 , and he believes we have it now . <p> " I think it 's one of the things that 's going to help us survive this darn thing , " he said . <p> At a daily press conference this week , Premier Ford reiterated the importance of Ontarians sticking together . <p> " This is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an army behind us , an army of 14.5 million people , the hardworking people of this great province .

@@51589641 <p> TORONTO -- Morgan Rielly has been working out at home trying to stay in shape . <p> The Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman is also reading , watching movies and improving his rudimentary cooking skills . He 's fairly confident with the barbecue and has a decent handle on pasta . <p> " I do n't have the confidence yet for fish , " Rielly said . " I do n't want to under-cook it ... then we 've got a whole other situation on our hands . " <p> And when there 's quiet moments -- there 's been , quite frankly , a lot of those -- he 's reflected on Toronto 's rollercoaster campaign that screeched to a halt when the NHL suspended its season March 12 because of the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> A few weeks before the pause , Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas used the words " Jekyll and Hyde " to describe his team . <p> On some nights , they were world-beaters with a high-flying roster consisting of Auston Matthews , Mitch Marner and William Nylander up front , Rielly leading from the back end , and Frederik Andersen in goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired Mike Babcock as head coach in November and could seemingly almost do no wrong . <p> And then there were times following that somewhat expected surge when basic breakouts or defensive zone coverages looked like advanced algebra . <p> Rielly sat out 23 games with a broken foot he suffered blocking a shot in Florida on Jan. 12 in an 8-4 loss -- one of many low points in the New Year . <p> He then watched emergency backup goalie David Ayres become an international celebrity when the Carolina Hurricanes embarrassed Toronto 6-3 at home on Feb. 22 , and was on the road to witness the Leafs gain a solitary point against the San Jose Sharks , Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks -- who just happen to be the three worst teams in the Western Conference . <p> Despite having a lot of information , Rielly still has few answers . <p> " I ca n't really put my finger on it , " he said on a conference call with reporters Thursday . " It 's important that we use this down time to really take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have to be better . <p> " If you look at the ups and the downs , that 's obviously not how you want your year to be described . " <p> Rielly returned to the lineup two days before the novel coronavirus outbreak forced the NHL 's hand , playing more than 21 minutes in a gritty 2-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning . <p> The Leafs , who were 36-25-9 and in a post-season spot at the time the league went on hiatus , seemed to play up or down to the opposition 's level throughout 2019-20 , which is a problem for a team that once again started training camp with Stanley Cup aspirations . <p> " You want it to be a bit more consistent , " Rielly said . " But with the bad there 's always good . We answered the bell at times when we had to against some pretty good teams . And then the downs being the games where you 're supposed to win or you really expect a good team to be able to win , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have to take it personally . " <p> On that personal side , 26-year-old was n't all that pleased with his play before getting cut down by injury . <p> He led all Toronto defencemen three goals and 27 points in 46 games , averaging a team-high 24:15 of ice time per night . <p> But due to an unspecified physical ailment and some inconsistent performances , there were stretches where he looked like a shadow of the player who set career-highs with 20 goals , 52 assists and 72 points in 2018-19 . Those 20 goals were the most among NHL defenceman last season , while the points total ranked third overall and fifth all-time for a Toronto blue-liner . <p> " There were times where I was good , " Rielly said of his 2019-20 . " And I think that there were times where I felt that I could have done better . <p> " That 's a bit how we as a team look back at the year . " <p> And even though it was brief , he 's thankful to have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his foot . <p> " When you 're training in the gym and trying to get back to play , you 're picturing playing 12 , 13 games and playing in playoffs , not playing one ( game ) , " Rielly said . " I 'm happy I played one because I think I 'd be going crazy if I had n't played since January . " <p> Rielly flew home to North Vancouver , B.C. , after the NHL allowed players to relocate away from their team 's cities last month , and is spending time with girlfriend and Olympic figure skating champion Tessa Virtue in self-isolation . <p> " We 're both in it together , " said Rielly , who 's usually loathe to discuss himself in public . " We 're trying to keep each other sane and we 're doing what we can to do our part and just quarantine ... I 'm glad I 'm not alone because I think that can be challenging . <p> " It 's important to keep in touch with those people in your life . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic changed life as he and the rest of us know it are chats with teammates about a season that may never end -- the NHL could return later in the spring or summer , or perhaps not until the 2020-21 campaign in the fall -- and process how it played out . <p> " You reflect and you picture things going differently , " Rielly said . " This is a really good opportunity for players to do some thinking .

@@51589841 <h> The Healing Power of Gratitude <h> " I am grateful for what I am and have . My thanksgiving is perpetual . " -- Thoreau <p> Asking " What are you thankful for ? " during a global pandemic might seem absurd . Every day the news gets grimmer . We hear sirens outside our windows . We read stories of hospitals stretched to capacity . Loved ones are sick . We ca n't leave our homes . Finding things to be grateful for right now might seem impossible . But studies show the healing power of gratitude . Feeling and expressing thanks can improve our well-being . What 's more important during the COVID-19 pandemic than that ? <p> Spend a few minutes every day writing a list of reasons why you are grateful . For example : I am grateful for my health and for my family 's health . I am grateful for the nurses and doctors working hard to save lives . I am grateful for the love I have in my life . I am grateful the sun is shining today . I also recommend reading , listening , or watching things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neighbors in Spain and Italy making music from their balconies , and puppies exploring an aquarium . <p> If you 're feeling afraid right now , that 's okay . Anxiety can harm our emotional health , but sometimes it 's necessary , and a little bit of fear can be beneficial . Anxiety tells us that we need to be alert . And we do need to be alert right now . When we leave our homes , we need to remember to put six feet of space between other people and ourselves , not to touch our faces , and to wash our hands frequently . A little watchfulness right now is fine as long as it does n't overwhelm us . <p> We 've known for a long time about the connection between mental and physical health . As we try to prevent ourselves from getting sick or speed up our recovery , it is helpful to boost our mental well-being . If you are feeling depressed or if your anxiety has gone beyond " alert " and become all-consuming , there are a few simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they all involved gratitude . <p> We do n't know what our lives will look like a month from now or even a week . When the world feels out of control , finding order at home becomes more important . Create a schedule for yourself . You might not be able to predict what the future will bring , but you can know what will happen today if you make a routine for yourself . Wake up at the same time every morning , go to bed at the same time every night , and fill your day with activities , including work , hobbies , solo time , and family time . Keeping your home tidy can also decrease your feelings of stress . The less chaos around you , the more at peace you will feel . Write a list of the things in your home for which you are grateful . For example : I am grateful for the food in my cupboards . I am grateful for my books . I am grateful for the tree outside my window . <p> At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. have orders to stay at home . There are things to be grateful for in this situation , too . If your home includes a partner , children , or roommates , and you ca n't find as much time or space to enjoy alone time as you 'd like , people who are socially isolating solo might appear to have it easier . For those that live alone , social isolation can feel very , well , isolating . You imagine how much nicer it would be to live with family or friends right now . The grass is always greener , right ? Whatever your living situation , write a list of the things for which you feel gratitude . For example : I am grateful for my pet . I am grateful I get to spend more time with my family . I am grateful for my own space . <p> For those socially isolating solo , feelings of loneliness and disconnection can increase depression and anxiety , so carve out time in your day to connect with friends and family through FaceTime , Skype , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carve out at least one hour every day to relax alone , and remember your partner/kids/roommates need solo time , too . This might mean taking a long bubble bath in the bathroom with the door closed or going into the bedroom with a book and closing the door . <p> Doing something creative can also help alleviate depression and anxiety . Journal , write poetry , paint , draw , make a collage , play music , or try your hand at a new dish in the kitchen . Write a list of the first things you 're going to do when the stay-at-home orders are lifted . Where do you want to visit ? Who do you want to see ? At which restaurants do you want to eat ? <p> There is beauty in the world , even in our darkest hours , and many reasons to feel gratitude . I am grateful that we have the technology to connect with our loved ones from afar because we need one another now more than ever . I am grateful to live in a country that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war , won two world wars , got through the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic , and healed after 9/11 . I am grateful for the hardworking scientists around the world who are looking for coronavirus treatments and a vaccine . <p> The best way we can help one another right now is to isolate ourselves physically but stay united emotionally and spiritually . And the best way we can help ourselves is by using the healing power of gratitude.

That is what has happened in Ontario . " <p> He adds the full scope of the pandemic could last anywhere between 18 months and two years due to potential secondary and tertiary waves of the coronavirus . <p> Dr. Donnelly said there is a broad range in the number of potential deaths because " where we end up depends on all of us . If we follow the rules , if we do our best to socially distance , if we look after the elderly and vulnerable in our society , we can get within that range and strive to get as low as possible . " <p> " To many people these will be shocking figures , but the important thing to stress is that effective actions have been put in place , remain in place and further actions are being proposed . " <p> Toronto 's Medical Officer of Health said based on the provincial data , the city was looking at between 600 to 3,000 deaths before the pandemic runs its course . Dr. Eileen de Villa called the numbers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more than just numbers , they are our friends , our families and our neighbours . They are our essential workers , our healthcare workers , they are the people that work each and every day to keep us safe . Most of all , these deaths are preventable .

" <p> Dr. de Villa reiterated that everyone has a personal responsibility to prevent the numbers from becoming a reality by staying home and adhering to the physical distancing measures . <p> " If we all do our part , if we all do as much as we can , we can still reduce these numbers , " she said . " I sincerely hope the starkness and clarity of the provincial modelling numbers will be a wake-up call , to all of us , particularly to anyone who does not yet understand the gravity of our situation .

However , we need everyone to play their part . We have to try to keep the prevalence of this disease to a minimum to allow our health care system to support those who need it . " <p> Further measures are expected to be put in place , but need to be put in place carefully , Dr. Donnelly said . Reducing the number of essential businesses is something that needs to be done carefully and thoughtfully . <p> Social distancing guidelines will also be enhanced along with more intense enforcement of those measures , including fines for non-compliance . <p> The immediate action that will be put in place will be enhanced capacity for contract tracing and increased testing , especially for those in long-term care homes and for health care workers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the province , Dr. Donnelly said when people have enough " herd immunity " or enough of the population has been infected , but added it will take vey complex modeling . <p> The presentation below contains modelling and projection data surrounding COVID-19 and Ontario .

@@51591741 <h> The politics of 2023 presidential elections <p> As Nigeria braces for the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic , politicians are still doing their thing- Politics- It is a global practice , no harm . The Adams Oshiomhole 's two weeks bitter power struggle in the All Progressives Congress ( APC ) is a pointer the 2023 elections in Nigeria which is still three years away , but the political actors have begun scheming how to grab presidential power . So , we can not shy away from discussing the politics of the 2023 presidency . The battle will be fierce -- the opposition Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) will be on the offensive ; while the party in power , the All Progressive Congress the ( APC ) will be on the defensive . Ordinary Nigerians will be able to put both parties on a scale and score them . PDP had spent 16 years in power while the APC would have spent 8 . Both have tasted power . Who is bringing something new and interesting ? <p> The issues of security , economy and the fight against corruption will be on the front burner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from what they used to be ? What ought to be ? These questions will be very paramount to many Nigerians and the answers will be key to deciding who they will vote for . <p> In addressing these concerns , the APC may struggle and may be on the defensive , giving the PDP the edge to go on the offensive . What may help the APC is the politics of the vice president 's slot <p> Based on current permutations , the APC will likely zone its presidential ticket to the southwest- with frontrunners including Bola Ahmed Tinubu , Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Governor Kayode Fayemi . The PDP , on the other hand , seems to be spinning on a spot- Atiku is currently the only person who appears willing and ready ; though , as times moves on , the field will be crowded . <p> For instance , if the APC picks Tinubu and PDP picks Atiku again , it will be an interesting contest . Each of them has well-established political structures that can easily scare an opponent and each can pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics and have decades of political relevance and strong public support . Notwithstanding the candidate each party fields , the joker of the 2023 elections is the choice of running mates . Any party that gets this wrong will suffer a devastating loss . <p> For APC , picking its vice-presidential candidate from the north will give the party an edge . Some people in the northwest ; especially governors in their second terms would be interested in the position , however , the northwest has produced two presidents and one vice president from 2007 to date . Besides , the ordinary man in the northwest may not expect the presidential or vice-presidential ticket to be zoned to the region , and most of the governors are in their 60s . Nigerians will expect to have a young VP in his or her 40s . In a modern democracy , the vice president 's position is tooled to present another face of the government . If the president is old ; a young vice president is picked , acting as a balance in the government . <p> It is rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a president . With Nigerians likely to use same scale to gauge both APC and PDP- performance in security , economy , and the fight against corruption , APC 's weapon will be to present a young person from the north as its vice-presidential candidate . In 2015 , the north-central gave APC nearly 15% of the 15,424,921 votes ; while the northeast gave the party 18.4% of the votes . In 2019 the north-central produced 15.2% of APC 's 15,191,847 votes , while the northeast muscled 21.3% . Democracy is about numbers and at the same time , about simple logic . The APC may not just ignore the northwest 's 46% and 61% votes contribution to its victories in 2015 and 2019 but apply logic by giving the vice president 's slot to the northwest 's cousins- the northeast . The region has also some young men in their 40s playing vital role in the politic which is also an added advantage .

But contact tracing is the essential behind-the-scenes work needed to stop transmission . <p> Contact tracing is the labour-intensive investigation by public-health officials to identify people who might have been exposed to coronavirus . The process is about getting people assessed , tracking down their contacts , and potentially isolating those who have been exposed to the virus -- even before they start to show symptoms . <p> It 's seen as a critical component in the battle to flatten the curve so hospitals are n't overwhelmed by a rush of critically ill patients .

" By providing provincial offences officers with this temporary power to obtain identifying information under the EMCPA , they will be able to enforce emergency orders during these extraordinary times . " <p> The fines may not be worthwhile , because if someone decides to contest them , the current closures of the judicial system could cause delay and result in a backlog of cases , according to Rudnicki . <p> Through his years of experience as a criminal defence counsel , Rudnicki claims the law will affect the most vulnerable people in society , and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> " We know that every law that there is in Canada disproportionately affects poor people , people with mental illness , people who are addicted , Indigenous and racialized people , " said Rudnicki .

This concept has flourished in every country and resultantly entire world is engaged in an arms race . With this escalation of the arms race , human development has been pushed aside . <p> Studies show world military budget grew to $1.8 trillion in 2018 . US military spending spiked by 4.6 percent to reach $649 billion , followed by China that increased its military expenditure by 5 percent to $250 billion .

Such a huge amount is spent just for ambitions of power and the next reason is the rivalry between the nations . <p> Since lust for power is inherent to man , thus war has its history . In all times , wars have occurred . And , we can not say the future would be without war and in this background , some experts legitimate the arms race . Some people believe that the arms race can help in the prevention of war .

It is not up to standard on the part of a man who talks much about social , cultural , moral progression and their importance , to hold an imperialistic mindset . Our claim that education enlightens our life crumbles down when an ' educated rulers ' prefer to rule with an iron fist . It also renders the concept of ' Democracy ' meaningless . <p> One may argue if not war , security is still imperative for the country as fundamentalists and radical elements exist everywhere and this calls for military development . Agreed , but in doing so we must not forget the basic essentialities of our life . <p> One can easily glean from the current situation how the rulers have worked for people 's quality of life and social progress to date .

A common man thinks how better it would have been if the armed race had been replaced by the ' Human-development race ' .

Idiot . <p> We all know the saying ; behind every rumour , there 's always an element of truth in it . I remember clearly when the issue of 5G was announced and scientists and medical practitioners vehemently spoke about its health implications on human beings . I strongly believe that , there is something that our leaders are not telling us . For instance , I just got to know that , there was a 5G network trial in Nigeria in November .

It is left to the government to prove that the so called 5G is not harmful to the people . Like any other critical human , I have my doubt over the stories about COVID-19 . I strongly believe that what is killing people in Coronavirus is more than the lies about the virus . Daddy Freeze should not be embarrassed at critical analysis of traditional Western campaign . We need to hear the truth about Coronavirus . For this suspicion , President Buhari refused to speak until overwhelming outcry against his silence .

Not only relying on anyone . In any clime , the guy would have been arrested . The gospel also need 7G ( not even 5G ) to spread so that rapture can happen . Thereafter Antichrist can take over . <p> All the African presidents collected 1million dollars for the installation of 5G in their various countries . So what ever you are saying they must install it because of the money collected from those devil , may God help us all <p> As far as am concerned , pastor Chris voiced out what he think about the 5g which I can and will give him credit for that ... <p> How many of you come out to question the government when they are doing the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr.freezer how many time have you spoken to the government to be careful on their looting on the nation fund ?

Ignorance at its worst . Why is Ogun state locked down if Fed government wants to install 5G in Lagos &amp; Abuja ? I have 38years experience working on several telecommunications systems especially microwave technologies both in public&amp; private sectors . It is crass ignorance to link 5G to Coronavirus . It was the same kind of protests when mobile phone technologies ( 1G , 2G , 3G , 4G ) were to be introduced . Let 's be wise . <p> The real agent of darkness here is you opposing what Chris said .

Oga , hide ya face , there is no link between 5G and the Virus . Besides , are you aware 5G was tried in Nigeria back in Nov. 2019 . U here crying , u moron like Oyakhilome . <p> You are stupid for saying such shameful things , If you do n't have valuable information to share then do n't say anything , allow others who have taken time , money and patience to research sensitive information concerning the public to tell you what they know instead of saying ABSOLUTE NONSENSE and abusing who ever you think you can online .

And , when I sat here , I had the same inner-gut feeling , that we had to do something . That we had to make sure that we supported this cause ... . " <p> Stanfield thought about the COVID-19 crisis blanketing the country and wondered how he could help . What could he , as the fifth-generation leader of his family 's firm , do to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now his responsibility to carry on ? <p> This week , while sitting in the factory 's aged , wood-adorned boardroom -- with framed pictures of his forefathers hung on the wall behind him -- in the same brick factory that has been producing underwear , war-time necessities and other garments since 1882 , Stanfield laid out the results of the fast-paced plans that have come to fruition . <p> " We stand here today making the gowns in the same factory that opened in that timeframe , " Stanfield said . " I 'm tremendously excited that I can carry the legacy on of what our former leaders did through all of the years to stand up this company - you know , we 're still family-owned , we 're five generations , we 're 164 years old , with deep roots - to what it means to be Canadian . " <p> " There 's an extreme level of pride in Truro today . I am an excited fifth generation Stanfield family leader of this venerable company , following in all my forefather 's footsteps , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home during this time , and supporting Canada during this crisis . " - Jon Stanfield <p> In the midst of his solitary pondering , Stanfield reached out to some local ER doctors , including Dr. Stephen Ellis , for some advice on the possibility of producing medical gowns and/or face masks . His thought process , he said , was " what can we do to help the cause and what can we do the fastest ? " <p> He arranged to have Ellis drop off one of the medical gowns in his mailbox to use as a spec for a prototype and over the coming days proceeded to connect with provincial and federal officials with his concept . <p> Those efforts culminated in this week 's announcement that Stanfield 's would be proceeding with a $24-million federal contract to produce 2.6 million gowns between early May and late October and a provincial contract valued at $4.32 million to supply 480,000 gowns over 16 weeks . The contract with the Nova Scotia government and the Nova Scotia Health Authority includes an option , if required , to provide an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's a legacy thing of our brand . We have always been dedicated to this country and to Canada through what I can read of all of my forefathers , " Stanfield said , during the video conference . <p> But in addition to providing a fast-paced influx of drastically needed protective medical gowns , the Stanfield-inspired initiative also translates into a call-back of 72 laid-off employees and a call-out for at least 108 immediate new hires . That 's 180 motivated people who can proudly go to work knowing that not only are they earning a livelihood but , that they too , are contributing to the national cause . <p> " There 's a big new hire that is going to happen in Truro , " Stanfield said . " We had overwhelming support on the weekend , like 500 applicants came in to support our efforts . " <p> That sentiment carries over to a number of other companies that will be helping to fulfill the quota the Stanfield 's contracts mandate . <p> " This is not just making branded products , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are really stepping up and saying they want to be part of that and support these efforts , " he said , of officials from companies in New Brunswick , Quebec and numerous others in Ontario whose futures and employees also stand to benefit from the gown contracts . <p> From the perspective of his company alone , Stanfield described the impact of the contracts as " immense . " <p> " The future looked very scary for this type of company . So we quickly pivoted to really determine what we could do to support it and these two contracts will provide a very nice bridge to allow us to get through the crisis to see where the economy lies at the end of it and how consumers and our retail channel partners are reacting as they open their businesses , rebuild the consumer traffic that 's required for people to buy our brand . But it will be a significant impact over the next six to eight months on our business , " he said . <p> " I think this is a great symbol of not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of things when needed . I think over the years manufacturing has been a little bit maligned in the country . " <p> But he also said it is important to consider such made-at-home manufacturing capabilities for well beyond the point when the COVID pandemic ends . <p> " ... we need to ensure that we have the capacity domestically to support these types of things , " he said . " We have such great innovation and great ingenuity in Canada , we have to make sure in the future , as a result of what 's happened here , that we have a level of domestic supply and readiness right across the country . And really , that ca n't be turned off after this . There needs to be a mid-term solution to this and a long-term solution to this . " <p> While that need not entail Canadian companies producing gowns , masks or ventilators on the scale they are required now , manufacturers should be equipped so they can maintain available output and allow it to ramp up faster . <p> " So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch up a bit you can , " Stanfield said . " Because when borders start to close and supply chains go to zero , it 's very difficult for a country of our size , meaning 37 million versus the behemoth south of us of , 390 million , and European nations , these people gobble up supplies very quickly . So , we have to be sure that we have two lines of supplies . " <p> But , in expressing his pride at being able to contriubte to the coronavirus battle , Stanfield said he was also grateful that other suppliers were so willing and ready to jump on board . <p> " I 'm just thankful that we have the ability to do this and I 'm grateful that we have great other suppliers who have just put up their hand and said ' Jon we 're in with you and we can go at this really quickly ' , which I think is just fantastic .

" <p> To prevail against the pandemic , the world will need to work together . That means heightened solidarity , and it means having the necessary resources , said Guterres . <p> The financial situation of the United Nations remains perilous , and it has only enough cash to fund peacekeeping operations through the end of June and no capacity to pay troop- and police-contributing countries , he said . <p> While COVID-19 is first and foremost a health crisis , its implications are much more far-reaching , he warned . <p> " We are already seeing its ruinous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle to find the most effective responses to rising unemployment and the economic downturn .

" <p> The world faces its gravest test since the founding of the United Nations , said Guterres . <p> The world is struggling to absorb the unfolding shock : the jobs that have disappeared and businesses that have suffered ; the fundamental and drastic shift to daily lives , and the fear that the worst is still yet to come , especially in the developing world and countries already battered by armed conflict . <p> " This is the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations itself , " he told the Security Council .

Caring people just like you ! <p> Thinking of your experience with tvo.org , how likely are you to recommend tvo.org to a friend or someone like you ? <h> Comments <p> A visibly frustrated Premier Doug Ford said on Wednesday that Ontario 's COVID-19 testing numbers were " absolutely unacceptable . " This came after Ontario 's daily testing levels had fallen to 3,000 or below -- about 10,000 fewer than the stated capacity . On Thursday morning , the health ministry announced new expanded testing criteria that will likely see more tests administered . <p> One of the more prominent critics of the province 's testing regime so far has been David Fisman , a professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto 's Dalla Lana School of Public Health . Fisman appeared on TVO.org 's #ONpoli podcast last week and agreed to a follow-up interview on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> TVO.org : You 've been critical on social media about Ontario 's rate of COVID-19 testing so far . What 's wrong with what Ontario is doing ? <p> David Fisman : I think there have been two things wrong . One has been -- I do n't know what the inside scoop is , but I think we 're starting to learn -- that folks did n't really anticipate how much testing they 'd need to do and did n't anticipate the need to radically scale up in order to keep up with this epidemic . <h> Stay up to date ! <p> Get Current Affairs &amp; Documentaries email updates in your inbox every morning . <p> The second issue has been the failure , in my view , to temporize quickly in order to track this disease , given that there were problems with testing . So , you know , the lab could n't do the throughput required . Okay , that 's a problem . They gradually solved that , but as has been pointed out by many people , Quebec has been subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved quite a bit quicker than Ontario did to download testing from central public-health labs to hospitals . There have been solutions : it 's a crisis situation , so moving to alternate test kits when their preferred kits ran out was something they moved to eventually . Again , I think all of this could have been done with more urgency . <p> If you ca n't test for a disease like this , you can also do what we did during SARS , which is using probable case definitions or clinical case definitions . We know what this disease looks like on average , or we think we do anyway , so when testing is n't working , you can take a page from the book in Hubei , in China . When their testing was n't keeping up , they just went straight to clinical case definitions . In the Chinese context , that meant if you have a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on your CT scan -- they seem not to fear radiation to the same degree we do ; they would just fire people through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll add you to the count , because we want to manage you so you do n't spread COVID-19 to others . That has nothing to do with lab-test availability . In fact , during the SARS debacle , we did n't know what caused SARS until May , and the epidemic started in March in Toronto , and we made it through March and April with clinical definitions . It 's just basically a failure to adapt to the battlefield as the battlefield changes that has left us really flat-footed . <p> TVO.org : On this issue of insisting on lab-test results , one thing I 've been told is that you want to get a proper test confirmation , a lab confirmation , before you do any treatment . But is there any real treatment for COVID-19 at this point ? <p> Fisman : Not that I know of . You can put someone on a ventilator because they are n't oxygenating anymore . There 's a bunch of experimental therapies , and I think a lot of the old-time Victorian approaches to medicine -- like treating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to emerge as possibilities , but , no , it 's not like we have this vast array of therapeutics available that are waiting for lab confirmation . I mean , it 's a public-health crisis , and you want to identify people correctly for a variety of reasons . <p> The most painfully stupid part of all of this in Ontario has been this desire to go down with the ship . We do have a probable case definition in Ontario -- which , to the best of my knowledge , has n't been revised -- which still included travel or contact with a known case of COVID-19 . That , to me , just demonstrates an absolutely painful failure to change your tools as needed as the epidemiology evolves . <p> The integrated Public Health Information System case data , they 've got a public component to that : the three modes of acquisition still say " travel , " " contact with a case , " or " neither . " We do n't even have community-acquired cases in the official definition . You 're a neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot people who work at Public Health Ontario , and I think a lot of them do n't like me much anymore , but I know them , and I know they 're very competent . I look at this state of affairs , and I think " gobsmacked " is a good word . I just do n't understand it . <p> TVO.org : You 've mentioned what Quebec has done . What else should Ontario be doing instead of what we 're doing now ? <p> Fisman : We apparently have a capacity to do 13,000 tests a day , and we 're doing 3,000 . The question is , why in the name of sanity are we not using that capacity ? <p> I gave infectious-disease rounds at U of T today , and one of the audience members piped up and said , " You know , there 's a committee looking at changing the testing guidelines , " because , right now , the guidelines are so restrictive that unless you 're basically a health-care worker who 's sick or you 're sick enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which is a real problem . <p> So there are a couple of things . One is we need a meaningful probable case definition ; we need to be counting those cases . The other is , if we have that test capacity , let 's get on it . This is a week now the backlog has been worn down , tested down , and it 's been a week now we have n't been testing at levels we 're capable of . It 's great that they 're testing for clinical care . They should also be casting a very wide net to find cases . If they 're really trying to control this by finding cases and isolating them , you should n't have guidance like what 's on the web tool that says , " You have a new cough , a new fever , but you do n't have known contact with a COVID-19 case , and you have n't travelled to Wuhan , so just stay in your house for 14 days . " You should want to find that individual . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of their house and come to a testing centre , but we 've also seen innovation for months now from the United Kingdom , from places in Ontario that have set up mobile testing . <p> You could imagine , if we have this tremendous test capacity , you do n't want people flooding test centres and giving each other COVID-19 . But you could set up mobile testing so people who know what they 're doing and have personal protective items could go house to house and test people . There are lots of ways to scale this . Test everyone who 's being admitted to hospital -- whether they 're coming in to give birth , whether they broke their leg , whether they 've got kidney failure -- test them for COVID-19 because you do n't want to miss people . We do this now for people with MRSA : Why on Earth would you not do that for COVID-19 if you have the capacity ? Test health-care and chronic-care workers regularly so that we do n't have these awful outbreaks . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned the high rate of positives we 're getting -- I take it because of the low level of testing . Why is that a problem ? <p> Fisman : I think it 's a problem because it 's contrary to World Health Organization guidance , and it 's WHO guidance because what they 're saying is , if you 're that high , you 're not testing enough . You 're looking for the disease where you know you 're going to find it . For the people in ICU beds on ventilators , it 's appropriate to know that they do have COVID -19 and not some other disease , but that does n't really help tell us what COVID-19 is doing in the community . So you need to be casting a much wider net . Again , it does n't have to be all testing , if you have some meaningful clinical case definition , not all those people are going to need treatment , but you should want to find them . You want to find the hot spots , rather than saying you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's inconvenient and it creates bother . That 's not how you deal with an outbreak . <p> You should be casting your net wide ... It 's the old " looking for your dropped earring under the streetlamp thing " : you know you 're going to see it there , so you look there . We 're not looking all over the place , including in the dark , and we need to test more . <p> TVO.org : I 'm trying to get a sense of where this should be placed on the public 's list of concerns in terms of the government 's response to COVID-19 . Is this , for example , comparable to elected leaders deciding not to order more draconian shutdowns of public businesses ? <p> Fisman : I think this is and is not a problem . I 'm actually relatively bearish on how much you can do by identifying cases and isolating them . Even if you 're doing a full-court press , you miss too many cases . <p> Could Doug Ford have closed things down a week earlier ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice he was likely getting , and given how challenging it is politically , I think he did really well in terms of the shutdown . <p> I 've said it many times : I think the control group for us is New York , and we 're not in the shape New York is in . We should be very grateful , because there 's no reason we should n't be , except that Ford instituted social distancing , physical distancing , and Eileen de Villa did , too , early enough . <p> That said , my biggest concern right now in terms of under-testing relates to institutional outbreaks . This is a bug that shows it likes to take off in places where people are gathered together , and we 're seeing that happen in long-term-care homes , in hospitals , and in prisons . <p> So , to me , the surveillance and infection-control components to testing are extremely important , and the places you most want to up that testing are any sort of institution where people are crowded together . You want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving anything to residents and patients , and you want to be testing both residents and patients liberally , especially on entry to the facility . <p> TVO.org : Given some of the really tragic death tolls we 're seeing out of some long-term-care homes , in particular ... I do n't want to be alarmist , but the only way to ask the question is to ask it : Has the lack of testing cost lives ? <p> Fisman : Of course it has . Of course it has . Because how else do you know where you have infected workers ? I think the reason this has moved into long-term care like wildfire , and they recognized this quite early in British Columbia , is the economics of it . The people who work in long-term-care facilities -- personal-support workers and care workers -- are doing very hard work that is underpaid . A lot of them do n't have benefits . A lot of them have multiple jobs to feed their families . So you 've set up a structure that is guaranteed to move this disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they 've done in British Columbia is that they 've given those people a degree of economic security , they 've upped their pay by $4 an hour , something like that , and they 've made people full-time at individual facilities . I 'm sure the long-term-care home operators wo n't like that , but , if you do n't do that , you 've created a network the disease can move on . <p> TVO.org : Last Friday , the government published its projections , its modelling for what the next few weeks will look like in terms of COVID-19 cases and deaths . Given the issues with the testing , how confident are you in the projections of any model , including the one you 've made ? <p> Fisman : I think it 's challenging . We 're doing the best we can with the data we have . We 've seen some positive signs in terms of the Ontario projections . And it will be interesting if they do scale up testing -- it will look a little bit worse for a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Ontario 's control is starting to improve , as much as we can say that from the limited data we have . And that 's been a very welcome sign . And we also see some signs of that in the absence of an overflow in the intensive-care units . <p> So , again , I think it goes back to what Ford did on March 14 , in terms of starting to shut things down . That did n't depend on testing . That 's a mechanism for epidemic control that does n't depend on being able to actually see the epidemic . I think where testing is going to be important is protecting institutions : shelters , long-term-care homes , hospitals , and also in terms of trying to figure out if we 're beating this thing so we feel good about climbing down , because at some point -- it 's like the bear chases you up the tree , and now you 're safe in the tree , and that 's great because maybe the bear ca n't get you , but at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> TVO.org : The threshold we 've all been talking about is ventilator-bed capacity , in the hopes that we do n't get to the point where there are more people needing ventilators than there are available ventilators . As someone who 's done some of this modelling , you 've looked at the province 's model published last week -- <p> Fisman : I do n't know if there is such a thing . I made some of those slides . And another fellow I know made some of the other slides . And my model was n't a model : it 's basically a forecast . But we made things worse and then we made things better because we did n't have the data to calibrate to . <p> I 'm not sure the province actually has a model -- I think that was a little bit of political theatre , but it was nice political theatre , because I think it focused people . And I think the qualitative take-home that things could have been worse -- they 're now okay but potentially bad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realize people like to have numbers for stuff like that , but , at the end of the day , that was a qualitative exercise . And I agree with it : we do want to do better . <p> In terms of the ICUs , we 're following it day by day . What you would expect if social distancing is going to work is that this is the time we 'd see some flattening , and we 're seeing some flattening . Every day that passes without us having a second surge from people returning from Florida is a good day . So we 'll see what happens this week . As of two days ago , we had 216 people with COVID-19 in ICUs in Ontario . We had thought we had about 400 ventilator beds to work with , so we were at 50 per cent full or so ; because of the reductions in elective surgery , actually ICU capacity is up by another 200 beds in Ontario , which is an unexpected silver lining to shutting things down . We still have room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're making in other places because their ICUs are full . <p> And , again , I 'd circle back -- and I know I keep saying it , and I know it 's kind of weird as someone who , probably two months ago , would have been enraged if someone had suggested I was a Doug Ford supporter -- but Doug Ford : the guy did it , you know ? I have a lot of issues with the public-health response at the provincial level . I do n't have any issues with Doug Ford . He 's not a public-health physician ; he 's not an epidemiologist . He 's dependent on advice , and I think some of his advice has been bad . But he 's made the important decisions right , and he deserves a lot of credit . <p> Fisman : I think we 'll see . It seems to have not knocked us over yet . Would one have preferred that the guidance was a bit stronger on March 12 ? Yeah , I would have . I think we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . This week will tell us . We 're headed to three weeks out from the return . We 'll see .

A total of 3,800,000 masks , 5,000 protective suits and 2,000,000 gloves arrived to Valencia region to equip hospitals and elderly homes . ( Juan Carlos Cardenas/EPA/CP ) <p> In homes and hospitals across the country , Canadians are now directly encountering the existential threat that authoritarian forces pose to their lives . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our foreign policy establishment has opportunity to dispense with ideological fantasies of post-nationalism , and embrace the reality that nations are comprised of citizens , borders and interests . <p> Instead of pursuing genuine cooperation when confronted by the virus , authoritarian regimes in Beijing , Tehran and Moscow facilitated its transmission by concealing their failures , proliferating disinformation about its source , and expending immense resources exploiting this crisis for their exclusive economic advantage . They are weaponizing medicine to advance their standing in the world order . <p> The implications of this subversion of Canadian interests are immense , and place two crucial objectives before our leaders . First , Canada must ensure that our vital supply chains are not at the mercy of non-democratic adversaries ; and second , we must deepen resilience and cooperation among other democracies . <p> At the very intersection of the present debate between globalization and nationalism , featuring economic dislocation and global disruption , are questions around the critical supply chains that cross sovereign borders . For decades , dictatorships in China , Russia and Iran have manipulated uncritical assessments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable by the seduction of economic supply . Across the free world , Holland , Spain , Italy , Australia and others now contend with the threat of junk supplies masquerading as " aid " from China , while public health systems are strained or overrun . Canadians are contending with precisely these same challenges . <p> This pandemic is forcing our leaders to prioritize the medical security of Canadians , competing for supplies with even our closest ally , the United States . When the immediate emergency transitions to a post-COVID-19 economic order , understanding and securing the critical needs of Canadians , and the supply chains that meet them will be an essential and historic undertaking . <p> The coronavirus has highlighted the vulnerability that global value chains ( GVCs ) present when non-democracies exploit the rule-of-law cooperation that underpins them . China , for example , has steadily climbed the medical device GVC as a result of their Made-in-China 2025 policy . One of China 's goals is to transition from being on the low-value-added end to the high-value-added end of the GVC in 10 manufacturing sectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply chains extend beyond medical supply to several products integral to our survival . With " China and India providing an estimated 80 per cent of raw ingredients of the world 's drugs , " a full review is needed around the complex risks China 's state-run economy poses , alongside mitigation measures to reorder these vital economic supply chains . There will be opportunities for economic self-reliance , in how much Canadians can produce and manufacture alone . There will also remain the need for secure supply chains , and those will need to preference the world 's democracies . <p> Tools are indeed available to protect the Canadian market economy against those that seek to upend it , including the Investment Canada Act . Matters of critical infrastructure , both physical and digital , are manifest in the national debate over Huawei 's role in Canada 's 5G network because of that Act , and establish important hurdles enshrined in law to secure the interests of Canadians . The same needs to be applied when it comes to the security of our drugs and medical supplies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on authoritarians , we remain at the mercy of such regimes ' incompetence or , worse , malevolence . Difficult days are ahead as we seek to understand the new economic realities of the post-COVID-19 world . Canadian national interests demand economic independence from authoritarians . <p> Authoritarians have become masters at subverting the postwar democratic order , while democracies have confused pluralism with moral relativism and equivocation . Canada should now take the lead in promoting a democratic national interest that boldly strengthens the bonds between new and established democracies , and that builds resilience in vulnerable democracies . <p> These regimes reject responsibility for their role in the global spread of the virus , unencumbered by domestic accountability and obsessed with repression and lifetime rule . Rather , they haveresorted to igniting obvious disinformation andmisinformation about the pandemic , contributing to what can only be called an " infodemic . " And now they seek to capitalize on the global chaos they have principally engendered . <p> China has been particularly brazen , using this opportunity to deepen its control and material influence across UN agencies , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and INTERPOL . The Iranian regime , too , is taking advantage of this international emergency . Despiterefusing medical help from Doctors Without Borders andthe United States , it continues to pressure the international community for sanctions relief in the form of cash . If the past is any indication , it could use that relief to fund terrorist adventures abroad . Russia is exploiting the pandemic and energy price war to further erode EU and NATO cohesion on sanctions levied against Putin regime officials and kleptocrats . Russia 's recent " aid " delivery to Italy -- of which 80 per cent was discovered to be " useless " according to a recent report -- was clearly part of what the EU 's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell identified as a " struggle for influence through spinning and the politics of generosity .

One need only look at Italy or the United States to realize that is not the case . However , our democratic allies have , in large part , been transparent about their challenges andhave cooperated with Canada to limit the impact . Conversely , our adversaries have been anything but helpful . <p> The lesson we should draw from this experience is that deepening democratic resilience , and forging stronger bonds with democratic allies , ought to become central goals of our foreign policy . <p> This can not be accomplished by diminishing Canadian democratic convictions in pursuit of a seat at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has occupied an outsized obsession of the foreign policy establishment .

For all the investment , expertise and diplomacy that has captivated Canadian leadership around this project , it has distracted the country from guarding against the threat of emboldened authoritarians , and undermined our ability to advance the national interests of Canadians . <p> As we rebuild , Canadians will rightly insist that a democratic and economic logic inform our interests in a world order where medicine is now weaponized . They would rightly insist that the supply chain decisions on essential matters provide for an independent Canada .

Statscan surveyed households on labour conditions between March 15 to 21 , reflecting an early wave of company closings and layoffs . <p> Job losses , however , do n't cover the full extent of disruption . Another 2.1-million people worked less than half their usual hours , or were away from work , bringing the total number of affected workers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 15 per cent . <p> As expected , the accommodation and food services industry was hit hard , with nearly 300,000 people losing their jobs , a decline of 24 per cent . The information , culture and recreation industry lost 13.3 per cent of its employment , while educational services dropped 9.1 per cent . <p> All told , employment in the services sector plunged by 6.3 per cent , compared with a 1.2-per-cent decline for the goods-producing sector . The manufacturing and construction industries held up relatively well , Mr. Porter noted , which is not usually the case in recessions . <p> " Just in terms of the job losses by industry , it 's like the world 's been turned on its head , " he said . <p> Story continues below advertisement <p> Statscan pointed to a striking gender divide in Thursday 's numbers . Women between 25 and 54 , the core working ages , lost more than twice the jobs ( 298,500 ) as men in the same age cohort ( 127,600 ) . Nearly one-fifth of employed women in that age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in March , compared with 13.9 per cent of core-age men . <p> " A lot of those women are going to be staying home even longer , because somebody has to watch the kids and women tend to take on those primary caregiver roles , " said Tammy Schirle , an economics professor at Wilfred Laurier University . <p> Statscan also noted workers in " less secure , lower-quality jobs " were more likely to experience job losses in March . For instance , the number of employees in temporary jobs decreased by 14.5 per cent , compared with a drop of 5.3 per cent for those with permanent jobs . Employment for lower-paid employees -- those earning less than two-thirds of the 2019 median hourly wage -- declined by 15.8 per cent , compared with a 4-per-cent drop among higher-paid employees . <p> Young workers endured a brutal month . The number of employed people aged 15 to 24 dropped by nearly 400,000 , or 15.4 per cent , with the decrease almost entirely in part-time work . The youth unemployment rate is now 16.8 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jobless rates do n't account for the entirety of damage . For Statscan 's Labour Force Survey , the unemployed are considered to be those who are available for work and have looked for employment in the past four weeks , along with those who have been temporarily laid off and expect to rejoin their employer . It also includes those who are set to start a job within four weeks . <p> Given those stipulations , many workers affected by COVID-19 are not officially considered unemployed . For instance , a jobless parent who 's suddenly handling home-school and daycare duties , and thus is n't available to work , is not considered unemployed . Nor is the jobless person who 's stopped looking for work because their industry has stopped hiring . <p> Story continues below advertisement <p> Instead , those workers are classified as not in the labour force .

If they were counted as unemployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At the provincial level , Ontario experienced the largest job losses in raw numbers , with the number of employed people declining by about 403,000 , followed by Quebec at 264,000 and British Columbia at 132,000 . <p> The April jobs report , released in early May , is widely expected to show brutal results . Since March 16 , more than five million Canadians have applied for financial assistance with the federal government , hinting at another round of record job losses . <p> Ottawa recently unveiled a program that will subsidize wages for eligible companies by up to 75 per cent , to a maximum of $847 a week per employee , aimed at dampening layoffs and encouraging rehiring .

@@51605141 <h> Why We Already Have False Memories of the COVID-19 Crisis <h> New research sheds light on spotting false memories of emotional events . <p> Have you heard people ' remember ' things about the COVID-19 crisis that you know ca n't be right ? Or maybe you have a friend who keeps merging memories of social distancing guidelines ? Are you struggling to remember whether that breaking news that just popped into your mind was about the UK , the US , or maybe even Italy ? Are you sure that your friend 's memories of his symptoms back in January ( which he now describes as early-onset COVID-19 ) are exaggerated ? <p> If you feel like we are all losing it , and our memories are going rogue , you are not alone . <h> Do false memories look real ? <p> Research has repeatedly shown that false memories can feel incredibly real and can be multi-sensory : In some , we can hear , feel , or see things , just like in real memories . Indeed , to be considered a false memory it ca n't be a lie , it needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length in my book , The Memory Illusion . <p> But this week new research takes this even further , and shows that false memories also look real to other people . <p> My article Do false memories look real ? was published this week in Frontiers in Psychology1 . In it , I present research I conducted involving two studies and over 200 participants . Read the full open-access article here . <p> I found that if someone has a false memory , we probably ca n't tell just by looking at the memory . What may be more surprising is that people also seem to be no better than chance at identifying true memories . <p> Participants watched a video of a person recounting a true emotional memory , and the same person recount a false memory . They were told " All , some , or none of the videos you are about to watch involve memories of real accounts . Your task is to identify after each video whether you think the account described actually happened or not . " . <p> The videos were filmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexfalse memories2 . The false memories in the videos either involved committing a crime ( assault , or assault with a weapon ) or other highly emotional events ( animal attack , or losing a large sum of money ) . <p> In both studies , participants were no better than chance at spotting whether a memory was true or false . Some participants were also just given an audio version ( rather than a video ) of the memory . In this situation participants were worse than chance . It seems people were actively relying on bad cues when listening to the memories , and somehow these cues made them worse than had they tossed a coin . ( If you want to know more , here 's a great write-up by science writer Ed Cara . ) <h> How this pandemic is giving you false memories <p> What this means is that if you already have false memories of what you have done , heard , or seen during the COVID-19 pandemic , you probably ca n't spot them . Bothyour memory of the news , and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly being changed or contaminated . <p> A few things make us more susceptible to false memories right now : <p> Source confusion . What we learn from multiple sources about the same topic can very quickly become confused . This can lead to creating false memories based on source confusion , which is when we misattribute where you learned something . For example , in reality it was your weird uncle who said that thing , but your brain may incorrectly be sure it was the BBC . That 's a small false memory , but at a time like this , it can have profound effects . Especially when that thing is a dangerous misconception . <p> Fake news . Some of the content we see online will be false or misleading . Reading headlines or posts in a rush , we may not realise that a story is from an unreliable source . Fake news is often specifically created to be memorable , and to influence our thoughts and behaviour . According to research , people are " most susceptible to forming false memories for fake news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Co-witness contamination . We are all witnesses of this world event , witnesses who are talking to each other all the time . If the COVID-19 pandemic were a crime scene , this would be really bad news . Witnesses can influence one another , and their memories tend to blend - these are called co-witness effects . As found repeatedly in research , " Witnesses who discuss an event with others often incorporate misinformation encountered during the discussion into their memory of the event " ( 4 ) . <p> Sameness . Every day we hear unprecedented news or horrific medical stories . But after weeks or months of the same type of information , with a reduction in the amount of new and exciting things happening elsewhere , it gets difficult to separate this long stream of information into meaningful bits . Brains are n't made for sameness ; they want separation and novelty . This means that whether it 's another " how are you " conversation , another statistic , or another day at home ... our memories are blending . This makes it easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is just a taste of how your memories are likely already becoming distorted by this new reality . So , how do you prevent it ? <h> Preventing False Memories <p> During these unusual times you may want to consider implementing additional safeguards to keep your memories safe . <p> If you want reliable memories of this highly emotional time you need to keep a journal . Assume that those feelings , ideas , fears , beliefs , and experiences will be forgotten . People are generally bad at remembering these details later on . You may already be underestimating how worried you were when this started , how under-prepared , or how defiant . <p> Even what you stockpiled will be forgotten . All those things you are learning about disaster preparedness you may well forget or misremember later on . Make a list now of things that you are learning -- things you will want to have in your house , things you will want to know . That way , if there is a second wave of outbreaks and you are back in lockdown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something other than your unreliable memory to rely on . <p> Too late ? Already think you or someone else has false memories ? Look for independent evidence . You can check the news to see when you actually went into lockdown , or whether you tweeted something about how you felt , or maybe ask a friend what you said to them . That can help establish whether you have a false memory or not . <p> Prevention and evidence are what you need , because it 's likely that once you have a false memory , neither you nor anyone else will be able to spot it .

More recently , there have been sharper rises in Quebec and Ontario in comparison to our province . <p> The relatively low number of reported cases and a flattening of the curve of newly added cases in B.C. can be attributed to a number of factors . <p> Voluntary self-isolation has proven to be essential in preventing community transmission in the early days . <p> When federal and provincial health authorities repeatedly gave low-risk assessments of COVID-19 's threaten to Canadians before mid-March , Asian Canadians wasted no time to stay on high alert to prevent the community spread of the disease . <p> Many B.C. residents placed themselves in a voluntary self-isolation for 14 days after returning from overseas . As of March 9 , Canada had only nine cases among those who had reported recent travel history in China or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 77 then confirmed cases . Those numbers had shown no growth since February 23 . <p> Practising social distancing is more than just keeping two meters apart . <p> When Canada followed the World Health Organization 's advice to keep our border unlocked to international travellers , the Chinese Canadian community started practising social distancing in an innovative way .

Unfortunately , the reality is that we are all in an unprecedented moment and many jurisdictions in Asia and Europe have shown strong evidence that wearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission of the virus . <p> As we make our health-care workers the priority , the general public should also be prepared to wear masks when possible . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases -- i.e. , screening and then enabling streaming those who are seriously ill , with mild symptoms . or with no symptoms at all . <p> While our existing hospital system is still able to handle and focus on those patients in critical condition , temporary field hospitals should be open to accept patients with mild symptoms . <p> In the meantime , those infected who have not seen symptoms should be placed in restrictive self-isolation to stop the spread to their family and community . <p> Better late than never .

In the interim , official guidance from public health authorities is to proceed with caution when adopting any of the speculative treatment options <h> Current healthcare approaches <p> Across the developed world , the preferred treatment approach has been to TEST individuals who display symptoms of the COVID-19 virus , after which patients are broadly categorized into 4 groups with a variety of healthcare approaches as outlined in the table below <p> From a public health perspective , there is arguably a two-fold gap with the current approach . <p> Firstly , individuals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to their house but with self-quarantine recommended . This is simply an honor-based system which relies on these set of individuals doing the honorable thing . <p> Secondly , asymptomatic individuals ( i.e. individuals who do not display COVID-19 symptoms ) are NOT typically tested , leaving them free to roam and potentially expose other individuals . <p> The number of individuals who are either not tested or being asked to self-quarantine is not known but is estimated to be in hundreds of millions of people globally . <p> As an example , in the United States , only 1.7million people have been tested as at 6th April 2020 , in a country of over 300 million individuals . There is simply no way 300 million people will ever be tested in the USA . Therefore , given existing financial resource constraints , it will be impossible to cater to the health of these groups of individuals . <h> Unit cost per COVID-19 patient <p> These reports estimated the cost range of treating a single COVID-19 patient requiring hospitalization to be within $5,000 to $88,000 per person depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nigeria 's health authorities are yet to publish an official COVID-19 cost estimate per person . However , for simplicity , let 's assume a conversion factor of 0.15 ( in other words , the cost of treatment in Nigeria will be 15% of treatment costs in the United States . <p> This 15% estimate will mean an average cash outlay of $750 to $13,000 ( or N270,000 to N4.7million per person depending on the duration of hospital stay i.e. 6 days stay or 23day intensive care hospitalization ) . This multiplied by a forecast of 39,000 positive cases in Lagos means a potential cash outlay of N10.5 billion just for Lagos alone . This , of course , excludes economic impact , never mind the residual 35 states in Nigeria <p> Interestingly , ExpatAssure ( a health insurance broker for expatriates ) estimates an average healthcare cost of $275 for a single night in a Nigerian hospital with an additional $110 average cost for consultation ( i.e. likely cash outlay for 6 days is $1,650 or N594,000 ) .

So far different countries have used different strategies to combat COVID 19 . Nigeria needs to choose a coat effective option that suits our epedmiologic and fiscal needs . In my opinion , I think the only applicable costs are those for Category E. Category D do not need to be tested and certainly do n't require admission . They can stay at home and simple analgesics and rest . Most will recover . This is also the strategy employed in the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with Categories A , B and C ( especially when we are outside the containment phase ) . We can model the population transmission and prevalence based on hospital admissions i.e. cases . This will also help reduce the cost of intervention and help our health workers focus on those who really require them . The other way to estimate the cost is to estimate that 5% of positive cases will require hospital admission . This is about the range seen elsewhere and may even be lower with us given we have a significantly younger population . For Lagos , I 'd double the 39,000 estimated as we are likely under testing and to offer a safe allowance in planning . This will mean about 80,000 cases in the next few weeks if things go well . Of these 5% will require testing and admission -- 4000 cases .

A new empire is rising as the old fumbles its way down a dark , uncertain alley . Elements of the much-celebrated global village have become separated by overnight executive walls , while families are locked as far apart as the east is distant to the west . <p> There is a dawning reality that nothing can be taken for granted anymore . Yes , you heard me ! Absolutely nothing , from the mundane to the very philosophical . Goodbye , the good natured ' Bless you ' expected from a compatriot when you sneezed , ( for no cold is merely a cold in these corona days ) . Even the free movement of labour , goods and services within your immediate location is no longer considered normal , and the sanctity of such ancient wisdoms as truth being the first casualty in any war can no longer be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the COVID-19 war . Months before the battle between her and fake news became the frontline , the hand was already battered . I watched in horror as this versatile human appendage was demonized at the war declaration stage and pilloried from the first shot . The hand , it is now official , is a new evil : <p> ' Do not shake hands ! Do not touch your face with it ! Wash your hands as frequently as possible , each time , for a minimum of twenty seconds ! You do n't have a stopwatch , did you say ? Not to worry . Sing ' ' Happy birthday to you , ' ' a couple of times as you wash and that should take you past the twenty seconds mark . You are asking me who you should wish happy birthday ? Well .... , I suppose there 's always someone on Facebook , is n't there ? Not ordinary soap , please ! Yes . Only antiseptic or antibacterial ones will do . Use antibacterial wipes as well ! No , stupid ! To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things up with a little hand sanitizer , that is , if you ever again come across some . Exactly ! It is your soiled , infested , virus-breeding hands we are talking about here ! ..... You want to know if you can use a washing machine ? Hmmmm .... ? I see what you mean . No ! No ! No ! You will still engage the ancient mechanism of both filthy hands scrubbing each other . Yes ... Cleansing evil with evil , you might say . That 's right ! ... much like the attempt to cleanse The PDP 's iniquities with The APC .... ' <p> And as The Easter season approached , I pondered very briefly how Jesus must have felt with those thieves right and left of His crucified self . Poor Him ! Why not ? I can say that , of course . He was quite poor on the cross . But that was then . He is richer than words can describe now for a fact . But I digress . Good thing is that the Son of God did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all finished . It was His call anyway . He could have decided it was finished whenever He wanted . <p> As for you , friend , you get to keep the hand you are dealt . As things stand therefore , you will be stuck between your virulent hands today , post-COVID-19 and for evermore . Grim , is n't it ? Now , how will you look anyone in the face ever again and utter those self-exonerating words : ' My hands are clean , eh ? ' That prospect gets even more worrying if your audience happens to be the Pearly Gate angels throwing the good book at you on the final day . Can you now work it out that where the current narrative is headed is not merely the last day of a four-week lockdown ? <p> Here is one thing that gets me really angry about this saga . What is really in the nature of man ? Why the innate desire to break rules ? It does n't matter if it is a man-made regulation or the law of God . Apostle Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself doing , and what his spirit desired , the flesh resisted . Ever since I was banned from touching my face , the desire has grown stronger to do just that . I admit that many of the moves were , and still are , involuntary . It is quite humbling all the same that despite several decades on this earth and much knowledge acquired , it takes a virus to show me the strong affinity between two geographically distant parts of my body -- my hands and my face . Inseparable collaborators they have been , albeit to the best of my ignorance . So intimate they are that it feels as if my hands were created from the ribs of my face -- a match made in heaven that , sadly , must now be put asunder over the new virus . <p> ' What about you ? What game do your hands habitually play on your face ? Let me warn that you too are a conveyor of fake news for not divulging what your hands get up to during those numerous flights to your facial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislodge some stuck dry mucus ? Okay , let 's be straight . Do you sometimes pick your nose ? Probably biting fingernails is your preference then ? Never ? I see ... Big boys do n't do such things , abi ? All you ever do is arrange your moustache , scratch your beards and retouch your make-ups ? Welcome then to the certified fake news era , the year of the deadly coronavirus . ' <p> It is so disheartening that in spite of all the trouble , washing of hands proved to be no magic wand so far as the virus continues to spread throughout our global Egypt . Like the Biblical plagues , it keeps multiplying , not even sparing the fortified courts of our modern day Pharaohs . Maybe in times like this , the world needs not scientists and their big brother governments . The world most probably needs prophets . And then , as suddenly as the virus spread , you 'd realise what a blessed generation this is . For , unlike the days of bearded , stammering Moses and his sidekick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world requires to exterminate the virus . ' For such a time like this !

Better not to dwell on any deserters in these very demanding times . Besides , being starved of congregations must be quite punishing for these mortals whose ventilation depends on masses of fawning , drooling spiritually gullible . They will be back , when the dust has settled , to spice The Good News with doses of self-aggrandizement . <p> I will rather now talk about ' Pandemic ' , the trending word ... Am I the only one who thought an epidemic is the worst that can ever threaten our human race ? And despite the infectious usage of this word , am I also the only person who has refused to visit The Thesaurus Mall to shop for its meaning ? Not that it matters anyhow . In these days of social distancing , avoiding malls of any kind may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are times when you need to be contended with your self-discovered meanings to life and to words . Even the most worldly of humanity are going philosophical . So I made something up , as unashamedly as medical scientists make stuff up these days . An epidemic must be something local to Africa . Smallpox , for example , or Lassa fever . A pandemic , being global , is obviously bigger . ' The meaning of Pandemic is an epidemic multiplied by ten , ' I therefore contented . I must warn you , however , that my choice of figure ten has no scientific basis . It is just that ten , as I learnt since my elementary school days , is a convenient number on the multiplication table . Furthermore , as things have progressed , I have also kept revising my self-inspired definition . Hence , a pandemic , with current realities factored in , is today ' an epidemic multiplied by fifty , and still counting . ' <p> Yet , you must not despair . You must resist all self-condemnation over the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world governments , multinationals and the mainstream press as they try to make you the villain in this war . I swear you are only an isolated , quarantined , house-arrested victim like most people . You must also be thankful you are not your next door neighbour who works at the coronavirus hospital without the proper PPE . <p> Let this comfort you further that governments around the world are also currently engaged in a frantic washing of hands , albeit of a different nature . To them , buck-passing is familiar grounds . Since the times of Pontius Pilate and beyond , governments and their functionaries have hardly taken responsibility for any disaster . It is therefore no wonder that China , from where COVID-19 originated , is now shopping for scapegoats ; The US , whose President initially described the pandemic as fake news , is today blaming The World Health Organization ; The UK government is keeping mum on its earlier fatal herd immunity policy while the Nigerian government will never admit that the medical infrastructure it has long failed to provide puts the lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Let government functionaries all over the world continue to do what they do best . When they are not playing the blame game , they mount the rostrum and preach from the moral and wisdom high grounds . They tell you what to do and what not to do in order to stem the pandemic . Still , from the way this virus outbreak has been managed around the world , never have both high grounds been more depressed . This is especially so regarding the befuddling measures reeled out daily on how the COVID-19 war will be fought and won . <p> You are told to trust the words of their scientists and to stay away from the social media . Yet , scientists have told us nothing we can run with . As things stand , every country has its own COVID-19 science , and a very important country like The US has multiple sciences . From China to Italy to The United Kingdom to The United States and to Nigeria , it is a cacophony of scientific opinions on prevention , symptoms and possible cures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In replacement , it now dons the multi-coloured garbs of literary appreciation and entertainment . <p> Yet we are told to dismiss social media information as fake . Put your trust in governments -- including the Frankenstein Chinese variety and The UK 's with its inaccurate daily COVID-19 death figures . Trust the government of The United States , a country where so far , the management of the outbreak is a totally confused and pugilistic process . Pin your hopes on the Nigerian government that has a penchant for copying every procedure from abroad only to apply them haphazardly and half-heartedly at home . <p> Anything , they say , as long as you stay away from the social media and its torrent of ' unverified ' COVID-19 prescriptions . No less an important personality than President Buhari 's deceased Chief of Staff echoed this line on his way to Lagos for additional tests and observation . He is reported to have advised in his final memo : ' .....

Eighteen months is a year and a half , for God 's sake ! So , what must be done as we wait in hope ? Nothing really . Just let your body fight it off . Immunity is king ! Let the weak get eaten by the virus . The few survivors will inherit the earth and really get busy afterwards with the highly gratifying business of fruitfulness and multiplication . <p> Here comes the critical question . Do you want to be one of those survivors ? Do you want to witness the post-COVID-19 world , even though you may presently be in the condemned , at-risk and disposable group that will be too old to reproduce and replenish the imminent Eden ? <p> Just remember that whatever they tell you , you have choices .

" <p> This comes after the province scrapped the cap on cannabis licenses . <p> It began accepting applications on Apr. 1 for licenses in communities of less than 2,500 people .

@@51628541 <h> Inside the troubled nursing home where 70 died and body bags piled up <p> A resident looks through a window at Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center in Andover , NJ , on Sunday , April 19 , 2020 . <h> When the coronavirus outbreak hit one of the largest and most troubled nursing homes in the Northeast , coughing and feverish residents were segregated into a wing known as South 2 . The sick quickly filled the beds there , so another wing , West 3 , was also turned into a quarantine ward . <p> But the virus kept finding frail and older residents , and one culprit became clear : The workers themselves were likely spreading it as they moved between rooms and floors , outfitted with little or no protective equipment . <p> The nursing home , Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Centre II in Andover , New Jersey , which has 543 beds , was chronically short of staff and masks , and over the past two years it had received poor grades from federal and state inspectors . Residents were crowded three to a room , and as the outbreak worsened , so did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workers said they hurriedly made their rounds , dispensing medicine , changing bedsheets , feeding those who could not feed themselves and doing other tasks that brought them into close contact with residents . <p> Some workers bought rudimentary face shields from a recreation supervisor who purchased a box online for $160 . By last week , employees were pleading for help from the government and for donations of personal protective equipment in Facebook posts . <p> But it was too late . <p> After receiving an anonymous tip last Monday , police found 17 bodies in bags in a small holding room at the Andover facility . <p> The startling discovery illustrated the toll that the coronavirus outbreak has taken on the nation 's nursing homes and other congregate facilities that house society 's most vulnerable , including older people and those with mental and physical disabilities . <p> By Sunday , at least 70 Andover residents had died and dozens of the 420 remaining residents and staff members had either tested positive for the virus or were sick with fevers , coughs or both , according to county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7,000 people at nursing homes across the country , The New York Times has determined , and has even ravaged facilities with sterling reputations . <p> But it has been especially devastating at nursing homes like Andover that have long come under criticism for quality of care , inadequate staffing and questionable business practices . <p> This examination by The Times of what happened at Andover is based on interviews with current and former workers , administrators and relatives of residents , as well as a review of property records , financial filings and inspection reports . <p> Federal and state officials said they were investigating . Relatives of residents , as well as a union that represents some workers there , have called on the state to take over the home . <p> The state has not responded to such a request , but Gov Philip D Murphy said Saturday that he was considering sending in National Guard medics to nursing homes around the state , after having previously deployed them to two homes for veterans . Earlier in the week , Murphy had called the deaths at Andover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The owner and operator of Andover said in statements that they had dealt responsibly with an unprecedented crisis that was harming nursing homes across the region . <p> But relatives of residents who died at Andover said they were angered at the way the home had responded . <p> After an outbreak was declared at the home on March 29 , one of the first to die was Albert Roberts , 76 . His nephew , Brian J Roberts , said an Andover worker called his mother the morning of April 1 with the news . His uncle had not been tested for the virus , and the worker seemed to go out of her way to mention that Roberts never had a fever . <p> " Why is that the first thing you 're saying ? " Brian Roberts said . " The whole thing is just shrouded in suspicion .

They said they felt all but abandoned by the home 's management and state and federal officials . <p> " The staff are sick , and the residents are sick , " said a longtime worker at the home . " It 's an overwhelming thing . " <p> Andover 's management has blamed the pileup of bodies on " after-hours holiday weekend issues " over Easter and Passover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workers said the bodies were placed on the floor and on gurneys inside a small air-conditioned room routinely used as a temporary morgue . <p> Four of the bodies were taken away by a funeral home after being discovered , and the others were moved to a refrigerated truck , Andover 's police chief , Eric C Danielson , said . <p> Located in a rural area of New Jersey , 55 miles northwest of New York City , Andover consists of two related facilities that are across the street from each other with separate staffs . A smaller one , Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Centre I , houses mostly older people and has 154 beds . <p> The larger one , Andover II , has long been a place of last resort , taking residents with advanced dementia as well as some people who had been imprisoned or discharged from psychiatric wards . The 70 deaths amid the outbreak occurred there . <p> One government survey found that 46% of long-term residents at Andover II were receiving antipsychotic medication , versus the state average of 9.5% for nursing homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Jersey with less than 200 square feet of space for every resident , according to a Times analysis of nursing home data collected by regulators . Beds are spaced about 4 feet apart , separated by a cloth curtain , workers said . <p> Andover has struggled in the best of times . It has had two owners in less than four years . In 2017 , a former owner agreed to a $880,000 fine for billing Medicaid for providing " materially substandard or worthless nursing services . " <p> Andover II generated $42.06 million in 2018 , mostly from Medicare and Medicaid , according to federal records . <p> Both Andover nursing homes are now owned by affiliated entities of a Chicago-area health care investment firm called Altitude Investments , which paid a total of $81 million to the former owner in 2017 , a filing shows . <p> Altitude in turn leased the properties to a group called Alliance Healthcare , which manages the day-to-day operations of the homes . <p> Alliance Healthcare is run by Chaim Scheinbaum , and his co-partner , Louis Schwartz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended that Scheinbaum 's application to take over the operation of an upstate nursing home be rejected , citing " character and competence and other factors . " No further explanation was given . <p> Scheinbaum and Schwartz declined to be interviewed . Their lawyer , Christopher Porrino , a former state attorney general , noted that across the country , the virus had hit nursing home residents hardest . <p> " Andover Subacute is on the front lines of this crisis , cooperating with public health officials to prioritize patient safety while caring for the remains of patients who have tragically passed -- including a surge of those lost over the Easter holiday -- even as New Jersey 's morgues and funeral homes are being overrun by this deadly disease , " Porrino said in a statement . <p> Before the outbreak , Andover II received low ratings on federal and state inspection reports , which cited serious staffing problems . Each resident receives an average of 46 minutes with a skilled nurse a day , according to the federal nursing home report card . The New Jersey average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a letter to Scheinbaum complaining that on some nights , each of them had to oversee as many as 75 residents by themselves -- a number far beyond what is considered safe . <p> " It 's a place where the owners have always prioritized profit over the well-being of patients and staff , " said Michaeline Picaro , a registered nurse who signed onto the letter . <p> Picaro managed a wing at Andover II from 2015 until last year and remains in contact with many current workers . <p> " There 's always been staffing shortages and supply shortages , " she said . " This is not just a COVID situation . People say ' Why do n't you leave ? ' Well , if you 're an ethical person , you do n't leave . You try to do the best you can with what you have .

A worker wept openly after a longtime resident died . Housekeepers stopped coming in because of the danger , so recreation staff members were asked to clean rooms . <p> Workers said management at first provided masks only to registered nurses , not to others who also interacted with residents , including housekeepers , recreation therapists and nursing assistants . <p> Even so , the firm that owns the buildings , Altitude Investments , suggested that the crisis was under control . <p> The firm said in a letter to investors in Israel that as of April 2 , two residents had been sent to the hospital , others were being treated on site and residents were being separated to prevent the spread of the virus , according to the letter , which is in Hebrew . <p> William Rothner , president of Altitude , said in an email Sunday that the letter " was based on information provided by the operator , " which rents the buildings , and that his firm had offered to provide assistance . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by police at Andover , a well-liked and longtime worker died . She had commuted with co-workers daily from her home in Kearny , New Jersey , in a van that also made pickups in Newark , which has the highest reported number of cases and deaths from the virus in Essex County . <p> After she died , fear of the virus grew among workers . Some stopped coming to the home , leaving an already lean staff even more short-handed , three workers said . <p> By last week , at least 32 workers at Andover II had tested positive for the virus , according to county records reviewed by a federal official . <p> Concerns about the lack of protective equipment and exposure to the virus had spread so widely among Andover staff that Dr Joseph J Casella , the medical director of Andover I , the smaller facility , said he had not ventured inside since the crisis began . <p> " Whether or not me being there or not would not have made a change in the outcome of these patients , " Casella said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the outbreak began , including eight who had tested positive for the virus . <p> Late last week , the state attorney general began an investigation into Andover . Federal and state health officials also launched inspections . <p> State officials said they issued several citations and ordered the owners to create a corrective action plan by Monday and to make hires for three key roles : an infection prevention specialist , a chief nurse and an administrative manager . <p> One Andover employee who is home sick said she was worried that the official intervention may be too little , too late . <p> " The state should have been looking at that place for a long time , " she said .

I would be wrong if I said I could . I know I did n't hear about it until 2020 . That 's how disconnected from the global perspective I could be at times . <p> But I remember what life was like for my family and I before we heard the first case in the United States . Taking walks was regular , and everything seemed to be okay . I dropped my older daughter at school every morning . My wife had a chance to step out too when picking her up from school . She strapped our then six-month-old daughter in her stroller as she took the twenty-minute walk down to our older daughter 's school for the pick-up . <p> She always said the journey to the school was longer than the one back home , even if it was the same route . My extremely extroverted daughter could n't wait to give a play-by-play account of all the events that took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess it reminds me of a lesson about life : time moves faster when you 're in good company . When I hear her talk , I always know that those were not my genes at work . <p> That 's how life was before the news of the virus . Life was a breath of fresh air . I remember how we took walks down to McDonald 's for the occasional McFlurry and Crispy Chicken Tenders . Handshakes , hugs , and the rare kiss were welcome signs of a caring heart and not life-threatening actions . But right now , at the peak of the curve , no one knows when the outdoors will be as enjoyable as it once was . No one knows . <p> Now we understand that Wuhan was not as far away as we thought it was . It 's now so clear that we are more connected as a species than we 've ever been . <p> What Do We Tell Our Children ? Wash your hands ! Do n't touch that ! Do n't lean on the wall ! As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want germs to grow on your head ? <p> How do you explain to a child that touching a doorknob can kill ? " Look both ways before crossing the road , " used to be more sensible advice . Sometimes it was the only warning they gave us as kids before leaving the house . But now the phrase " stay safe " has taken on a whole new meaning . It was n't that people did n't die from other things before COVID 19 . I think the problem is the probability of infection as well as the recovery rate . The former is so high while the latter is so low , and the statistics get worse every day . <p> I have n't spoken to my parents as much as I have in the past few months . The hours we 've accumulated over the past three months is more than throughout 2019 . <p> My father does n't tell me to stay safe . He asks about each safety item . He asks about the gloves , then the face-masks , the hand sanitizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tells me how much he 's praying for me . If I ever doubted my father 's love for me , COVID 19 has cleared all doubts . <p> So when someone tells me to stay safe out there , I know they mean " do n't get caught . " But as parents , you do n't ask your children to " stay safe . " You list everything they can do to stay safe . But how do I express these warnings to my children who are n't even old enough to understand that touching their faces is a significant risk ? All we can do is shout the warnings while my daughter looks puzzled as we almost go into a panic attack anytime she reaches for the doorknob . <p> The Power Of Human Connections A friend was to get married on April 11 . On April 10 , he had to send notices that the wedding was postponed . Postponement is bad enough . But heart wrenching are the words " till further notice . " We do n't know when it 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Postponing a wedding is one thing , but not being able to see the love of your life brings on a new level of loneliness . My heart goes out to those in this situation . <p> We live in Virginia . My daughter 's best friend lives in Maryland . Sometime during the lockdown , we had reason to drive down to Maryland to pick up some supplies . After the purchase , we took a detour to her best friend 's house . Since we could n't risk being within six feet , her friend had to wave from the balcony . <p> For someone used to having sleepovers with her best friend , she began to cry . The level of safety required to stay alive right now is tough on children , especially when you ca n't explain it to them in terms they would understand . <p> Will Things Ever Be The Same ? Hope is on sale right now , and everyone needs to buy it . It 's the only thing that brings some level of sanity . We would only survive this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrouded skies and prepare for the future . But what would that future look like ? <p> There 's nothing new under the sun . In 1918 , there was a pandemic of similar magnitude when influenza came on the scene . Social gatherings were put on hold , as is the case currently in many countries . ( Some countries are enforcing the lockdowns harshly . While some rely on the common sense of the populace to do what 's right ) . <p> It 's a little over a century since the last pandemic . A century , that 's the keyword here . We 've had a full hundred years of relative normalcy with regards to epidemics . So we can look back to have a favorable view of the future . We hope to get another 100 years of normality as a species . <p> I can tell my daughter that she 'll see her friends soon . I can say to her , " you 'll go to school soon . " If she asks for a bike , I can promise her she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride it under clear skies and without any threats to fresh air . <p> Will things be the same ? A lot of people have written on different platforms that it would n't be the same . I agree with them a hundred percent . Things wo n't be the same . But I know for sure that things would get better . We 've come too far and too low for us to go any lower . The only way forward for humanity is up . <p> That 's my sincere hope . <p> The Best Of Humanity Is Yet To Come I 've seen compelling stories in the past few days about people stepping up for others and making them know there 's still light even in these bleak times . <p> Some people shop for the elderly who have a high risk of infection and a low survival rate . The same goes for people who are at risk because of underlying conditions . We see the heroic efforts of frontline medical personnel who risk their lives to combat the disease . Some have families whom they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk to their lives . We also see some celebrities online sharing their wealth so that others who do n't have enough could have a leg up . Who knew that some people could do with a little less , right ? <p> Humanity needs its heroes . My daughter says she wants to be a firefighter , as well as a doctor and everything else that speaks to the hero complex . That 's why I can be sure that we will rise from this . But we will only grow when humanity shines its brightest light ; when each human heart focuses a little less on what 's best for me so that someone else can survive one more day . <p> We will rise from this .

@@51634841 <h> Coronavirus lockdown : Some 3.78m migrant workers in country face threat of layoffs <h> Top Story <p> ISLAMABAD : Out of total 8.51 million migrant workers in Pakistan , some 3.78 million are facing direct threat of layoffs and this process has already kicked off in major urban centers of the country . <p> " The closure of business activities would force the owners to lay off their employees and some have already started doing that . We assume that informal workers , which comprise 45% of the total migrant labour force , would be the first ones to be laid off . This means around 3.78 million migrant workers would be left without their source of livelihood " the economists belonging to prestigious Pakistan Institute of Development Economics ( PIDE ) stated in their <p> latest COVID-19 Bulletin on Tuesday . The PIDE pointed out that Punjab possessed 5.33 million migrant workers out of which 2.37 million were facing threat of lay-offs , Sindh having migrant workforce of 1.3 million out of which 0.58 million might face lay off , KPK 1.38 million out of which 0.61 might face retrenchment , Balochistan 0.07 million of which 0.03m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million of which 0.19 million face threat of losing jobs . <p> With the calls for social distancing and lockdown , the COVID-19 outbreak has shutdown business operations across the country . As projected , millions of people are facing potential layoffs but the situation is doubly bad for the internal migrant workers who are staying away from homes to earn a livelihood . While we worry about remittances from the overseas workers , these internal migrant workers remain largely ignored in all our discussions . <p> The official statistics show that around 8.51 million migrant workers are working across Pakistan ( based on the Labor Force Survey 2017-18 ) . It shows that of these 45% are engaged in informal activities including day laborers , construction workers , domestic helpers or factory workers . Furthermore , more than 65% migrant workers are residing in only 15 districts across Pakistan , with over a million workers just in Karachi , followed by major numbers in Lahore , Faisalabad , Rawalpindi and Islamabad . <p> Not all sectors would face a similar situation as it shows that majority of internal migrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction , transport and communication sectors , so employees in these sectors are expected to be hit the hardest . <p> The PIDE COVID-19 Bulletin No. 4 had shown that vulnerability of these sectors would cause a massive layoff of daily wage workers . Many of these daily wagers reside in the factory dormitories , which being shut now leave them with no place to live . With the bus and train services halted , they are left stranded with no place to go . <p> The PIDE states , " We must also remain aware that some of these internal migrants might also return home as they do after festivals . Reportedly , such return to the hometown did become an issue . With a prolonged lockdown there could be a possibility of a return migration " . <p> The PIDE presented four recommendations to the government including the social protection packages announced by the federal and provincial governments should include migrant workers while targeting the vulnerable workers regardless of domicile . <p> Second , there should be a provision to accommodate the migrant workers in their current district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment to their hometowns , as has been witnessed in India . The current practice of local administration requiring people to register in hometown for getting the unconditional cash transfers of Rs12000 for registration under the Ehsaas programme should be reviewed . It will lead to unnecessary movement and run counter to the lockdown intentions for corona prevention . <p> Thirdly , migrant workers , mainly the daily wage workers , need shelter during this period . Panahgahs should be opened for them as well , providing them the much-needed shelter and food . Soap and other hand washing facilities should also be provided to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread . <p> Fourthly , in cases where the internal migrant has his/her family with them , and they want to remain in whatever humble abode they have , they should be made part of any public relief initiative . A huge proportion of children , among the seasonal migrants that travel with families , are malnourished and any loss of wages further accentuates that .

There are flights being planned from different cities in India to ' rescue ' stranded Canadians . It is not that this COVID-19 crisis caught everyone off-guard and neither did it happen over a 24-hour period . PM Justin Trudeau had been strongly urging all Canadians to come home before it was too late , thousands either could not come for whatever reason while others probably thought they could wait it out , not realizing the wait would be longer than expected . Now Canada is expected not only to send chartered planes to bring these Canadians back , but also to foot the bill for many who are crying poverty .

Many of these Canadians lived there almost permanently and visited , I repeat , visited Canada in the summer months to see their families and of course pay their family doctor an obligatory visit and also schedule any surgeries if required .

I guess Canada is obligated to help every Canadian stranded abroad in a crisis . In the future there could be thousands of " Canadians " trapped in places like Nigeria and I am sure Canadian chartered planes will be dispatched to bring them home .

@@51638141 <p> Thank you and welcome to this quarter 1 result presentation . Yes , officially , quarter 1 result presentation . But since Duni , for the first time ever , today has released forecast for quarter 2 , I know there 's probably a lot of interest in talking about that . And I will come back to that . But since it is the Q1 presentation , let 's start with some highlights from the first quarter before we move into what we think about the COVID-19 impact of quarter 2 . <p> So if you 're looking at the net sales in the quarter , we saw totally a bit of decline with a couple of percentages . However , it was quite a difficult -- a different situation depending on which month you look at . We had actually a very good development in January and February , but then sales started to drop quite dramatically as from the middle of March due to , of course , the shutdown of restaurant and hotels across Europe in the -- because of COVID-19 . And we see that sales drop continue in Q2 . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means in terms of forecasts . <p> If you 're looking at the profit , that had a similar pattern , meaning we saw a decline totally in the quarter , but we actually had a very good profit development also in January and February . But then due to the volume drop in March that impacted the profit of March , dragging down the total quarter with SEK 13 million . <p> During the quarter , we also implemented a new sales and marketing organization , as previously announced . Reason being that we now are focusing on building 2 global brands , Duni and BioPak . That means that we also at from this in Q1 result presentation , also changing the way we 're reporting our financial situation . Instead of the 4 previous business areas , we 're now reporting into the Duni and BioPak segments . <p> The reason for the new sales and marketing organization was to strengthen our innovation , marketing and sales capabilities . That is a long-term objective . However , if you 're looking now at a more short-term impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to very fast implement our mitigation activities that proved to be important for us . And we also know that we will get to SEK 20 million yearly savings coming out of this new sales and marketing organization , which , of course , also contributes to better situation . <p> With that , I 'd like to have then a closer look at our 2 new segments then . First , starting with segment Duni . So in this segment , we provide innovative and sustainable solutions , mostly for the set table , and the biggest categories are napkins , table covers and candles . And it is in this segment that we see the biggest impact of COVID-19 situation , as you can see in both sales and operating income , which declined in the quarter . And again , it is the March numbers that impact the total quarter . <p> We see a bit of a difference between the different regions where Southern Europe is hit faster and stronger than Northern Europe . And that is , of course , in line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> All product categories are affected negatively , but mainly premium napkins and table cover . And although we see a positive impact on our material costs , it 's overshadowed by the negative impact from the lower volumes . <p> If we then move to the second segment , segment BioPak , which offers environmentally sound concepts in packaging and service products , and these products are sold a lot into the takeaway and ready-to-eat meals segments . There , we see that , actually , the sales and operating income growth also in quarter 1 and especially good growth in rest of the world . <p> So here , actually , the COVID-19 restriction increased demand for takeaway products during the end of the quarter . When restaurants were shutting down their sitdown services , they try to change into takeaway and delivery options . <p> The results were negatively impacted by weak Australian dollar , which , of course , now without big business in Australia , it 's impacting the total pictures . I 'd also like to mention that the Horizons business that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BioPak segment . <p> Now with that , I 'd like to leave the quarter 1 results and look at the situation moving into quarter 2 . And if we 're starting with having a look at what I 've written to the right , that is a key message I want to communicate . It is that we -- in Duni Group , we 're strong going into this situation . And with activity plans , we will also be strong after the COVID-19 situation . <p> So if we start then by looking at the sales situation , the basic situation to get good sales is , of course , that we have a healthy organization . And so far , we have no reported cases of corona or COVID-19 in the business . So we have put a lot of focus on keeping our organization healthy . And so far , we did success . And also , despite the work time reductions , we are also fully operational business . Including all our own operations , but also all our suppliers are operational . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a very good customer service level . So that is the basic is in place . <p> Then , of course , as we saw in the end of March , the COVID-19 lockdown is having a very strong impact on restaurants and hotels across the globe and especially in Europe . When that is said , there 's also an opportunity in takeaway , as I mentioned . Restaurants are shaping -- changing to more takeaway options . <p> Now since the sales start to decline already mid-March , we now have about a month of sales data , and sales have started to stabilize . That 's why we feel pretty confident in when we now forecast sales . And if we assume that the lockdown will remain for April , May and June , so total lockdown for the complete quarter , then that means that the sale will be reduced with more than 50% in the quarter . Of course , we all can hope that the lockdown will start to ease before that , but that would be the consequence if the lockdown remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then hope for a recovery , and we expect the recovery to take place during the second half of the year , but it 's very difficult to forecast at what rate that recovery will take place . <p> So with sales starting to come down , we quickly started planning for actions . And number one is , of course , to then adapt our production capacity in line with the lower demand , and that has taken place . We have , through work time reduction , managed to decrease capacity in our converting factory and also at Rexcell . In Rexcell , we also have the opportunity on selling jumbo rolls for other applications than our table cover and napkins . And that work has proven to be successful , so we are now increasing our production times at Rexcell , which is very positive . <p> So work time reduction is the biggest cost reduction -- biggest part of the cost reduction program , but we are also initiating and have initiated already many other initiatives , including cutting down of consultants , short-term employment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program in quarter 2 is now in the level of SEK 150 million . And there , we see no restructuring costs , and it will have an impact already as from the beginning of April . <p> We have also previously announced that the Board proposed to withdraw the already proposed dividend for this year . So with these activities , we see no need for additional liquidity . We have confidence that the loan facilities we have will cover and bridge us in this situation . So that is , of course , positive news . <p> But overall , you can say that we plan for the worst here . In most normal business situation , you do a forecast , which is realistic , and then you do best case and worst case . We did a forecast , which we believe was realistic . Then we did a worst case and much worst case , and we planned our costs according to the much worst case . So hopefully , we will get into a better situation that we plan for , but we feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quarter 2 . If we then dare to also lift our eyes a bit what 's going to happen when the market starts to open up again . I think we 're all aware of the discussions and the difficult balances of short-term health impact versus the long-term financial and long-term health impacts of the shutdown . So many countries now are planning for opening up the countries again . One interesting aspect that we see is , of course , that a lot of people being in quarantine situation now at home have a very strong need for social interactions . That 's why we believe that when the restaurants do start to open up again , there could be an opportunity for quite a quick recovery . <p> We also believe that when the restaurants open up , there will still be demand for more and stricter hygiene routines and hygiene products in the restaurants . And there , we feel well equipped . We have good table covers that will secure totally hygiene situation between each of the guests . We have napkin solutions that covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cetera . So good product offers in the area of hygiene , and we can help restaurants to build confidence to their customers that they have a hygienic operation . <p> We also now have built in the last year up a very strong business with 1 billion turnover in takeaway products . And here , we can also help our restaurants to build a second leg of their operations with strong takeaway business . And we expect that the take -- the increase in takeaway demand will also continue when the market starts to open up . So in total , we believe that we are well positioned to be not only strong , but maybe even stronger in the post COVID-19 situation compared to before . <p> When that is set on the forecast , we also feel confident that our long-term strategy is still the right one . And we are actually happy that it -- we did develop this strategy because it has helped us in the current situation . With the even stronger customer focus , we now manage to keep a good customer service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volatility in the market . So that has proven to be very important . <p> And also , the increased digitalization of our business have helped us to be able to , again , support customers and markets our products in other ways than through physical sales visits . So there were many parts of the strategy that has helped us in this situation . And we will continue to put also long-term focus on our sustainability and building together a more sustainable offer across the business . <p> And finally , as I said , we feel well positioned in the post corona area with 2 main brands . One , Duni brand that will help the restaurants and hotels to build up even more hygienic offer . And secondly , with the BioPak that can help the restaurants to increase their takeaway business . <p> And with that , I 'm handing over to Mats to talk you through the financial situation . <p> Thank you . And starting to look at the income statement where we can see that we had an operating income of SEK 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in quarter 1 2019 . So there is a drop of SEK 13 million . This drop of SEK 13 million can more than be explained by the second 2 weeks of March , where the sales were dropping . And we also had the effects of very low production volumes or even closed factories in this period to adapt to the much lower volumes that we are seeing coming through in -- as from the end of March . And also is that , as Johan have mentioned , we have the strong mitigation program , and the strong mitigation program is more or less coming into effect as from the 1st of April . So a very substantial effect at the end of March impacting the results of quarter 1 . <p> Going to the new segments , segment Duni and segment BioPak . We can see that the reduction of operating income is fully in the Duni segment . And it 's in the Duni segment that is mostly impacted by the lockdowns in Europe where , in most markets , restaurant activities are more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEK 76 million to SEK 56 million . <p> On the other hand , in BioPak , we have had a strong development throughout the quarter . And also , as Johan has also mentioned , that we see very small effects on the sales . And then at the end of March , also some positive effects for takeaway product , et cetera , starting the COVID-19 lockdowns . <p> Cash flow . We feel we enter this special period of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns in a strong position in 2019 and also during the last 12 months . We had an operating cash flow of SEK 646 million . And compared to the EBITDA , it 's very close to 100% cash conversion ratio . And this has been a focus for us during the last , I would say , 18 months to strengthen our balance sheet . And if you look into the balance sheet in -- specifically , you can see that we have a stronger position today than we had a year ago . The net sales-to-equity is -- no , the net debt-to-equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago , and the net debt-to-EBITDA is 2.2 versus 3 , more or less 3 a year ago . <p> And finally , our financial targets . Sales growth , again , impacted by the very low sales we had in the last weeks of March . The operating margin at 9.4% . And as we have said , we have withdrawn -- the Board has withdrawn the recommendation to the AGM of the SEK 5 dividend per share . And instead , no dividend to be proposed to be paid during this year . <p> Starting with the SEK 150 million in cost savings as of Q2 . First of all , if you can confirm that this is sort of a year-over-year impact and if you could break it down a little bit more in terms of how much is furloughs , permanent personnel reductions , discretionary spending , et cetera , would be very helpful . <p> Yes , absolutely . This is definitely a unique activity . And of course , part of it is that we have -- are reducing costs for consultants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the main part is , of course , that we are closing down production and reducing the working time for our employees . That 's really the main part of these savings to adapt personnel to the lower volume . And that goes for both indirect personnel and direct personnel working in the factories . And the major part -- absolute major part of the personnel in Duni are impacted by work time reductions . <p> Great . And you mentioned here in the report , you see no need for additional liquidity . Could you explain a little bit on your assumptions going into that statement ? I would assume that on the long term , if you draw this on long enough , also you would have some problems . So I assume there 's some assumptions on where the market should return going into this . So if you could elaborate a bit on that , that would be helpful . <p> Yes . That 's , of course , if the lockdown would be for several years , that 's clear . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the end of the year , will start to come back slowly , we see that we have the -- absolutely the liquidity and the financing that we need . So I think -- so that 's what we can say . <p> Okay . And regarding your leverage , as I recall , you previously talked about 3x EBITDA sort of a ceiling where you would feel comfortable in terms of leverage . Is it a fair assumption that your covenants are then perhaps at 4x EBITDA or something a little bit above that ? Or how do you think we should model ? <p> Okay . Then sort of on the market share perspective , it 's been a bit of a fragmented market . I assume that some of your competitors will go out of business or at least need some type of structural actions to carry on . Where do you see -- do you see the potential here to be a little bit aggressive in terms of M&amp;A or approaching clients in a more of aggressive way ? Or how do you try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ? <p> We are continuously scanning the market for opportunities . But I would be lying if I 'm saying that M&amp;A would be the main focus of our activities right now . We have now a lot of focus on making ourselves as strong as possible in this situation , and we believe there are organic opportunities for us with our offer to come out stronger . That is our main focus . <p> Right . And in terms of sort of customer -- your customers ' willingness to pay for shipped goods and credit losses and whatnot , have you seen any indications that you might see some credit losses in April or push to payment terms or so forth ? Or where are you with that right now ? <p> I think this is something that we follow very , very closely . We see as yet no major effects on this . So of course , the situation is not totally normal , but there is no major effects on this as at least not for the moment . But this is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think one thing that is important to keep in mind when assessing this is that we are having most of our sales through distributors , most of them are big and strong . And we 're not really selling directly a lot to the restaurants . So that is protecting us a lot in this situation . <p> Yes . Okay . Lastly for me , I mean , there used to be a discussion on logistics cost . I guess that is a minor effect now with everything that is happening . But at the same time , e-commerce and all that distance shopping has obviously -- has accelerated through this crisis . Where do you see sort of your availability to logistics and the pricing and whatnot ? Has that had any material impact on this ? And where do you see that going forward ? <p> At the moment , we do n't see a material impact of that . Of course , there is a high volatility in many aspects of the market . So it 's , again , difficult to forecast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and we could distribute as we want to our customers , and we do n't see a big impact in terms of costs . And that is , I guess , what we can say at the moment .

@@51640241 <p> The COVID -19 pandemic and subsequent international travel restrictions have highlighted the issue of British government 's support and help to dual nationals of UK and Pakistan . <p> In this regard , serious questions have been raised by different people about the extent of consular services and other help available to those dual nationality holders during their visit to Pakistan . While the UK 's Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) official policy states that during any crisis at overseas , the British government would provide support to its nationals including those having dual nationals , but some sources believed that the lack of understanding of the issue led to some feeling among the British- Pakistanis that they have been snubbed during the coronavirus crisis . <p> The issue has come into the limelight after reports emerged that thousands of British Pakistanis have been left stranded allegedly by the UK 's government in Pakistan during the coronavirus crisis . This correspondent has been contacted by a number of British Pakistanis with the same issue , one complaining that he had called the FCO in London to get his wife on a UK Government repatriation flight from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with FCO in London on their email updates scheme for UK Citizens . He further claimed that British officials informed him that despite his wife having UK Citizenship and a UK Passport , as she had used her Nadra card to enter Pakistan she would be not counted as a British Citizen , but as a Foreign National by the British Government . One of the criticism made against British High Commission is that they left vulnerable families some of whom requiring medications . <p> An official of FCO told Daily Times that the UK government would not normally offer support to dual British national in the country of their other nationality ( for example , a dual US-British national in the US ) or get involved in dealings between them and the authorities of that state . However , he said the government may make an exception to this rule if , having looked at the circumstances of the case , they consider that dual nationals are vulnerable and UK have humanitarian concerns . In the current Covid-19 crisis , he precisely mentioned British High Commission in Islamabad where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bring the Britons return home since a decision was made to repatriate the British nationals . <p> When asked for his views on the law concerning dual nationals , international Barrister Khadim Al'Hassan stated that ' International laws restrains the exercise of dual citizenship . The UK Government , for instance , has no positive obligation to provide diplomatic help , assistance to those who are in their other dual national country , however in exceptional circumstances the British Government has in the past assisted , but do not expect that this will be the normal course ' . <p> However , everyone did not shares the same views of the British Government and some groups of British- Pakistanis still question the strategy of FCO that if they were eligible for help during the crisis which was later provided than why were they being told by the UK foreign office staff that those who used Pakistani Identity documents to enter Pakistan would be counted as a foreign national by the British government . But other considers Covid-19 not as a crisis and agreed with the UK initial position which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other country which they hold nationality . The British government has laid on expatriation flights to many countries swiftly but not to Pakistan which appears to be consistent with their policy . However , once this issue has been raised by the British MPs and Media , they FCO started flights from Pakistan to repatriate the Brits . <p> Some human rights groups believes that many more people misunderstood the position and are considering whether in the new world order after this world pandemic it is worth holding dual nationality . They are concerned that with no vaccine and scientific knowledge not having answers then this may be a new beginning for us all and travel will not be on the agenda for a little while at least . <p> The issue of dual nationality has also been highlighted recently when the British Government took the unprecedented decision and followed it through the courts to strip dual nationals of their British Nationality and taking away their British passports . An estimated 37 people have had their British citizenship revoked . Their nationalities include Russian , Somali , Yemeni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lebanese , Sudanese , Vietnamese , Iranian , Iraqi and Nigerian , some even having held British passports from birth . <p> The British government has successfully stripped Pakistani 's of their British Passports and nationality which has been upheld by the courts in relation to a number of individuals who were released from prison following their convictions for being part of the Rochdale grooming gangs . The individuals Qari Abdul Rauf , Abdul Aziz and Adil Aziz have sought to appeal with the courts rejecting it . The Court of Appeal concluded that the Home Office and Immigration tribunal had not acted unlawfully and were " entitled to find that the deprivation of citizenship in the case of each appellant would be compliant " with the law . According to Barrister Al'Hassan , the law in the UK allows the Home secretary to revoke a person 's British citizenship ' if it is conducive to public good ' . This is a wide discretion and effectively means that dual nationals are always at a risk of their citizenship being revoked if they become involved in serious criminal offences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

It is easy to guess that authority would be in Germany , but another country hard to predict may emerge . <p> Middle East : The Arab Spring was like a warning to what would come for the region this century , as it may have its religious reformation , new states , and those who would take out grievances on their people . It is also likely that at least one major country would overplay its power for religious intolerance , with the oppression of others , but result in a major war -- breaking the country .

Some would be neutral zones in pandemics . Some would become spaces where others would build a new country . Some would face major secessions . Some would become armed republics . Some would become regions of intense conflict , etc. in the coming years and hundreds of years . <p> Technology : It is likely that another existence that will become as intelligent as humans will be an animal . If it 's an animal , it may not be domestic or what can be easily guessed . It is unlikely that general intelligence will be Artificial or computers . The dream of Artificial General Intelligence is likely to be on the radar of engineers , but if not elusive , it may not be necessary . <p> The weakness of technology is already false information , fakes , and conspiracy theories .

For example , the initial capacity for mechanical ventilators , for COVID-19 patients , until it did n't matter to keep many alive . <p> Though more old diseases will get curable , mutations and replications are likely to become more worrying . Adjustments to green energy are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already in a collapse of mind and behavior . Lots of people are in a crisis of emptiness . Some are nominally depressed and others have anxiety and other disorders . <p> Dependence on technology is likely to make this century one of failure for psychology in a manner resulting in all kinds of mind and behavioral suddenness and actions that can not be explained . <p> There will , at least , be a century of great psychology , probably from 2250 , or beyond , that would look back to this era and wonder how people became crushed by their invention while thinking they were living in the best time to be alive . <p> Though psychotherapy will take new forms , and more people will find ways to keep their minds light , but , place in history and usefulness for the future can become pivotal in easing anxieties for people . <p> Also , for lots of people , pornography will become a recruitment tool for homosexuality . <p> Many would-be triggered by images of something else , or what another experience would bring -- after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jokes and memes or seeking entertainment always from their smartphones will gradually be eroded from choice cognition and be taken over by something else , whatever it may be . <p> Drug use and overdose will enter into another territory as the mine collapses and many behaviors become undefined . Drug use will lead to an unprecedented amount of ' waste ' . Though , a way to heal for many will be when they see extremes that happened to someone they know , or a different presentation . <p> Atheism : There will be an explosion of spaces for atheists -- online and offline -- till at least mid-century this decade , especially as psychology collapses and what people can not understand befall personal lives of many . <p> But atheism spaces will be crippled by the failure of patience where many would see what wrong decisions they took because of lack of Patience -- a fruit of the Spirit in Christianity . <p> Also , some members will watch with disgust the lack of wisdom of many of their leaders . Also , they will be surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger belief of nothingness . <p> Lots of confidences of the atheist teams will fail suddenly , making many reflect on the outsized way they rated their strengths and knowledge . <p> There will also be individuals , who wished for something , and it happens or wanted something and they got it , but later found no lasting satisfaction . <p> For example , some people wanted a total collapse before COVID-19 , they got lockdown , yet became anxious and panicked . <p> Some also wanted freedom , or a desire , or a kind of drug , sex , or anything , they got it , yet was not the answer to their emptiness . <p> There will be lots of fatigues in their community , with deceit , envy , anger , those who breakout will be persecuted . <p> There is likely to be dedicated factions of atheisms , from general against all religions , to specific . Yes , it seems most atheists are against Christianity , but many would probably focus . <p> There will be those who will emerge with new thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but will always be impaired knowledge . <p> Since atheists claim to be curious , they can read the Book of Job from Chapter 3 till the end , then come back to read Chapters 1&amp;2 . If they can not find answers there , they can read Psalm 1 -- 50 . To understand that whatever they say is n't new , also to place why they hate God -- the love of sin or life 's troubles . <p> Space : Man may make Mars this century , however necessity and sustainability could continue or limit that exploration . Within this next one thousand years , an unknown planet or star could likely fly by , defying established theory on distant stars or gravitation , or all the work done to look for life on other planets . <p> It is also possible that lots of talents and resources that would 've been useful in revolutionizing economics , etc. will be spent to seek distant astronomy , but wo n't yield much after decades . <p> Judaism <p> Judaism will enter into a golden age , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel will benefit from some collapse that may happen in places within its region , expanding its territory and getting genuine conversions . <p> Catholic Church <p> People have different interpretations from the Scripture from many of the practices of the Catholic Church . But , it is likely that the LordGod Almighty has a covenant of mercy with the Catholic Church , probably because the Church was instrumental to Church history before Protestant Reformation . <p> No one can judge the Church , except Christ . <p> If committees in the Catholic Church were to guess what the future may hold for the Catholic Church , their submission may include that a major crisis may happen that will lead to power-sharing of the leadership of the Catholic Church with a leader or more of major Pentecostal Churches . <p> This , in the guess of the committees , may come as a way of forced restitution as God forgives the Church for several errors in the past centuries . <p> God decides , not committees , or any guess , but if that would happen , it may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church or Churches . <p> But in a recommendation , the committees may say towards restitution , intense collaboration with leading Pentecostal Churches , even if to the point of opening up its buildings for worship services , and collaborations on challenges facing the world . <p> Ultimately , the Catholic Church should keep crying to God , relentlessly for mercy , for so many mistakes of past centuries , and the LORD should remember His covenant with the Church . <p> Psalm 130:4 , But there is forgiveness with Thee , that Thou mayest be feared . <p> Also , the Catholic Church has been told by many before and starting from the Reformation about their Scriptural misinterpretations . Churches need to pray -- in groaning -- to JESUS to show and correct their mistakes and to have mercy so they can make the changes in obedience to Christ alone . <p> This century -- at least , will be one of more closet Christians than can ever be measured . The collapse of psychology will be so devastating , mindfulness will be helpless . So many will seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be important to continue true preaching because the Word of God does its work -- even if online video views are small , or it seems like no physical crowd or low metrics . <p> Religions around the world will often refer to their imitations of the Scriptures as a way to become epicenters of morality . <p> But within this millennium , there may be religions that will mix Christianity and others in what they will say are the way . The only religion that will not be used for this mix is Judaism , because of its similarity . But the true Word of God is the Truth . <p> There will also be people who will be ready to accept Christ even if the questions are not answered in a way they want , like why is there suffering ?

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for free . We needed a telco partner where we could get the data for free . Vodacom and us have worked together on this very powerful idea and partnership , to get access to a doctor for Covid-19 entirely for free .

It 's taken us time to build a chassis but it 's a very simple powerful idea , to bring online access for all South Africans to a doctor for Covid-19 . <p> It 's got enormous potential , even for after Covid-19 which we can explore in a moment . Where did the whole idea come from , for the two of you get together ? <p> We 've had this platform we 've built over a number of years called DrConnect . If you look overseas , best practice is about tele-medicine , right in the front line just as the first point of contact , it makes healthcare accessible . The issue here in South Africa . The guideline has been that a doctor ca n't consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen him physically first , this has been a restriction . On the back of that we have n't actually rolled out DrConnect very aggressively , we 've almost kept it on ice . With the Covid-19 issue it is imperative you get care to all South Africans , we have this idea , could we do this at scale ? It 's taken years to build the DrConnect platform and chassis , but over weeks because of Vodacom , we have managed to scale it . <p> Has that blockage then been removed , that you do n't have to first go and consult with a doctor physically ? <p> No , it has n't , the HPCSA guidelines remain . That 's why this service is limited only to Covid-19 . It is about treating Covid-19 . We continue to be in consultation and discussion with HPCSA , the Health Professions Council . <p> But you 've pushed ahead anyway . <p> We feel the imperative is just too great , we 're rolling it out in the process . <p> Is any mobile phone able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have access to smartphones . The power is you can go on our site by web or on mobile and use it via video or text you , or you can phone Vodacom *111# line . It 's very accessible . <p> How many doctors are on the other end of the line ? <p> There are two sides to this is , patients across the country have access to it for free . The others , doctors consulting with existing patients , are concerned about patient contact if the patient is positive . We see the other applications as doctors using the existing base . This is rolling out now and we have a pretty substantial training regime . Doctors can sign up and be trained quickly and get online . We have a core of about 150 to 200 doctors initially and I heard this morning that 5000 doctor 's potential are going to join .

We have committed R20m between ourselves and Vodacom to essentially buying 100,000 consultations . If we go through that we will have to think about how to continue the funding and have a look at other sources of funding , but doctors are paid to consult that 's the intention . <p> What do they get paid per consult on this platform ? <p> It 's about R200 or so . It 's a standard fee and hopefully worthwhile for a doctor . <p> Is it for any South African , anywhere in the country with access to a smartphone , if they 're having some of the symptoms they can then pick up the phone call Vodacom even if they are n't a Vodacom client ? <p> If you 're not a Vodacom client , the data then will not be zero-rated so there is a cost to it .

In the UK , there Is n't a restriction on doctors in the frontline , we have a virtual consultation service through vitality health in the UK they do close to 5,000 consults a week . We have used a lot of lessons we 've learned from it . It 's successful in markets like the UK , and we 'll really see how this plays out in this market .

But we 've got a large population of people who live in close quarters , people who immunes are compromised with HIV and TB . We 've got some unique challenges here . We have modelled a number of scenarios on the stuff coming out of the different countries , especially Imperial College predictions , and tried to understand where those numbers get to . The difficulty is the range of projections is incredibly wide , from kind of low to medium to high with where deaths can be hundreds of thousands . I do n't believe that will happen , I certainly hope it does n't , but we are preparing both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what we can and we can do what we need to for society and all of these projections . We 've modelled every single bit of data , we 've looked at our client base to understand people that are vulnerable and have learned that particular ages and comorbidities are more vulnerable than others . We 're reaching out to those vulnerable sectors of our client base to warn them to try and get them isolated and give advice to them . We are working 24 hours a day to use the data to try to keep people out of harm 's way , but the projections are very wide . <p> I had the opportunity to talk with your colleague and partner Alain Peddle who 's the deputy CEO of Ping An , it was fascinating to get his insights from what happened in China . It appears as though we 're drawing on those experiences . <p> We are , the Chinese lockdown was pretty substantial , the ability to flatten the curve is very much a function of how successful these processes are . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quite low , then in Spain and Italy the mortality is incredibly high . The riddle is trying to understand the denominator , how many people are really infected and trying to understand the age factors . You can draw a lot of lessons from each of these countries but I think we 're learning more about the best practice of flattening the curve , massive testing regimes , track and trace , which you 're not doing enough of , and hopefully start doing . We are trying our best to learn from all errors , the Chinese did a good job once they got going . The Germans have done a very good job , and I think Singapore and South Korea did a great job of containing things . We 've got the opportunity if we act swiftly . <p> All the countries that you mentioned , China , Singapore and South Korea have used digital tools aggressively . We heard from the president , Cyril Ramaphosa that those tools are now starting to be used . Is this a game changer potentially ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number of people . You 've got to track and trace those people that are positive , that is a key in this battle . We have acted swiftly on the issue of lockdown , but we have n't done enough tests because of capacity issues . People are working around the clock , labs , business and the ICD and all the rest . It will be a game changer , we have got to move quicker on the testing and tracking your tracing , it is crucial . <p> Through this tool that people can access online before they even go to a consultation with a doctor , is this disease or is this virus specific enough for them to quickly understand whether they 've got it or not or if they 're at risk or not ? <p> The tool that we roll out primarily now is about telling us your symptoms and getting you to a doctor virtually . The doctor then decides one or three things , leave it if your fine or referring you to a pathology structure for a test , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the front line to a triage process that will happen after that . It 's trying to make the process into the health care system more informed , it 's not trying to replace it , it 's trying to make sure that right at the front line you get educated doctors helping people navigate the system . <p> One of our colleagues in the UK , Linda van Tilburg was saying that there , if you have symptoms , the National Health Service ( NHS ) will tell you to self-isolate for a week and thereafter to engage with them again to see how serious it is , whether you need a hospital bed or not . Is that a similar line that will be followed here ? <p> I 'm not sure . Every country has to optimise the resources that it has . The ability to test every single individual instantaneous and get results is the best thing , but it 's not practical . Every country has different ways somehow , I 'm not sure we would do that . I think if we look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing much more vigorously and in much greater numbers . The tests are expensive , they take a long time , 24 hours to do a PCR test , at the moment . I 'm hoping we can test more people far quicker . Track and trace , if we can do that , we 'll get on top of this thing . <p> You have experience with DrConnect already . Are we a nation of hypochondriacs or do we go on there when we 're really sick ? <p> I 've been asked that often , about the extent of health claims that are going to see through the process , so we have to model these things very carefully . What 's interesting is the other claim areas are dropping , like the elective surgery . The worried are a lot less eager to get into the healthcare system now . This thing quite quickly gets rid of any fluff , people focus more on serious things , they delay elective procedures . Some of our modelling shows ironically , that health care consumption , certainly in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the higher scenario of claims because the other stuff drops off . <p> I know it 's very early to start looking ahead , but the problem in South Africa and why national health has become such a big issue is because not all South Africans have access to proper healthcare . Surely something like this if it 's proven , would be able to open up a new avenue ? <p> It 's a good question , I do n't know the answer to it , but there 's an interesting vortex of solutions being built . I do n't think the world will be the same after this pandemic . Not only the way we work , but certainly in healthcare . Lessons will be learned , bridges will be built . I 'm hoping that this is a device that is quite the opposite of the current structures , a sustainable system that gives all South Africans access to healthcare in some way . That will be a very good outcome . <p> How else do you think the world 's going to change ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a week . We have 80% of people working at home now . We are fully business as usual at Discovery , every single function is up and running . We are in meetings continuously , as I 'm sure you are with Zoom and Microsoft teams . I 'm learning how efficient you can be without having to travel around . The world of work is going to change . This idea of working from home which used to be an intellectual concept , which did n't really get going as it should have , is going to accelerate . We 're going to see a lot of profound differences in the way people think about how they work . The barrier between work and home has disappeared . On one hand it 's efficient , and on the other , it 's quite disarming . You do need routine and structure . There will be profound changes . A lot of things like the national health and many social security systems came out of the Great Depression in the world war . Its in times of adversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ' I ' . There 's going to be a lot of structural changes happening from Social Security to work and health care that will linger after this pandemic . <p> We 've seen a lot of that has been digitally driven . In China today you have a QR code as your colleague Alain Peddle was telling us , as long as your QR code is green you can go into the shop or if it 's red you have to self-isolate and so on . Is that a prospect for South Africa ? <p> I do n't know . It has both positive and negative consequences , if you 're not green you 're labeled as a potential danger . These things have different implications in different societies . The era of surveillance is going to be much more intense post pandemic for sure . <p> All South Africans now as a result of this can dial star triple one hash on a Vodacom phone or when they 're going through to Vodacom , and if they 've got Covid- 19 they will have access to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And there are enough medical professionals , with 5,000 who are prepared to come and join the system to be able to look after everyone in South Africa ? <p> That 's the hope . We 'll see how the experience plays out , but that is the intent . I 'm very confident together with Vodacom we can achieve it . <p> And your models , how long will the R20m last ? <p> We modeled a number of scenarios but we do n't know . I 'm hoping , not from financial concern , but that it does n't last long and that we can make this really ubiquitous . <h> Free online Covid-19 screening and consultations available to all South Africans through Discovery and Vodacom partnership <p> Discovery media release <p> Discovery and Vodacom have partnered to deliver a simple but powerful online healthcare platform for the benefit of all South Africans during the Covid-19 pandemic . This platform provides easy access for all South Africans to a Covid-19 risk tool , to help understand your personal risk for Covid-19 plus , where needed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Globally , telemedicine has proved invaluable in the management of this disease , with many governments and healthcare systems advocating for digital healthcare tools and virtual consults to be the first step and primary means of healthcare support during the Covid-19 outbreak .

Partnering with Discovery on this initiative is a great example of how two large corporates can use their core capabilities to make a real difference in the lives of all South Africans during this time . Vodacom 's extensive telco network will bring Discovery 's network of doctors to mobile devices all over the country . " <p> Discovery Health Chief Executive Officer Dr Ryan Noach explains that , " Importantly , this initiative means we 're able to protect doctors from continued exposure to COVID-19 and hopefully make their jobs much safer as they deliver this invaluable care .

" This is why there are security updates -- they are meant to find and close potential gaps , before threat actors find and exploit them . <p> " They are especially important when it comes to the OS -- as the OS is the heart of devices such as laptops , smartphones , and tablets . This software ensures that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in a connected way in this digital era . <p> " If this ' heart ' is outdated or unsupported , it is not only the user experience that will suffer , but there is significant risk that sensitive information could become compromised . Windows does a great job with constant updates , and users should be using this opportunity to ensure protection from cyber-based threats . " <p> Inevitably , an unsupported or outdated OS will contain vulnerabilities that have not been patched . As such , malicious users can target these weak points to gain access to the system and all its data . Even worse , if this computer is on a network ( as most systems are today ) , the entire environment risks compromise . <p> " It does not matter if an organisation has the best cybersecurity solutions available , if there is even one device running an outdated OS then the whole company is compromised , " says Yamout . " This is as much an educational issue as it is a practical one . People are creatures of habit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their OS .

With malicious threats growing and becoming more sophisticated , unsupported or outdated operating systems are an easy target for such threats to be a success . For instance , malicious mobile banker packages -- designed to steal credentials and money from people 's bank accounts -- are a growing threat in the local region . <p> " In January and February this year , almost 1% of connected South Africans were the targets of malicious bankers .

Acting Chair of the telecoms regulator , Keabetwse Modimoeng joins CNBC Africa for more . <p> COVID-19 has , in a matter of months , infected over a million people , torn apart families and societies , and destabilised economies . The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa ( UNECA ) has revised Africa 's growth downwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely need a stimulus of $100 billion . This does not even take into consideration the pandemic 's psycho-social ramifications . <p> Unprecedented times such as these call for rapid decision-making , coupled with innovative and effective solutions that can address continually evolving challenges . In the past few weeks , several African countries have taken swift action to get ahead of this crisis by implementing a spectrum of measures , including closing borders , instituting curfews and lockdowns , providing public sanitation solutions , monitoring and treating cases , and providing relief measures for local businesses . It is evident that several African countries , which have been affected relatively later than some of their global counterparts , have learnt important lessons over the past few weeks and have applied these in their decision-making . <p> Yet , given the enormity and complexity of this problem , African countries should continue to observe and draw on regional , continental , and international best practices , while taking into account their respective local particularities . Now is the time for cross-sectoral collaborations , for top-down and bottom-up approaches , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and individuals to all play their parts . <p> To supplement government efforts , mechanisms should be created to provide funding to African innovators , who are developing solutions to COVID-19 related issues . Crowdfunding platforms can be a potential solution , but only if regulators are able to fast-track requisite policies and regulations to enable them to function effectively . African professionals , such as lawyers , financial advisors and consultants , can be galvanised to donate their time to support industries and sectors that have been severely affected by this pandemic and help them implement mitigating strategies . Dalberg Advisors ' Safe Hands initiative , which is taking a multi-pronged approach encompassing inputs , manufacturers , funders , distributors , and policy to support the product and distribution of essential medical supplies at scale , serves as a case in point . Corporations should also be willing to reorient their talent pool and repurpose their facilities to address the most critical issues arising from this pandemic . Accra-based company DTRT Apparel is gearing up to manufacture a range of personal protective equipment ( PPEs ) to supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work together in redeploying their employees who would otherwise be redundant to companies facing higher demand , akin to a brilliant programme proposed in Estonia . <p> Business continuity , especially for MSMEs who are particularly vulnerable during this time , is a critical economic consideration . Jobs need to be retained and national government must move quickly to provide relief measures for this . Countries like Kenya and Ghana have been deploying surveys to understand the difficulties businesses are facing as a result of COVID-19 , including plunging revenues , disruptions in supply chains , inability to work remotely , and having business models that are simply untenable in the context of a global pandemic . Under such circumstances , governments can -- and several have already done so -- offer stimulus packages , including tax waivers and reductions ; lower interest rates to make debt cheaper ; provide low-interest intervention loans to vulnerable companies ; defer statutory payments for a minimum of six months without penalties ; amend policies on non-performing loans to prevent a systemic crisis among banks , and provide financial support to businesses that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latter is especially important for informal sector businesses that can not implement remote working measures . <p> Good governance in times of crisis requires a combination of top-down directives and bottom-up solutions . In combating this virus , one of the challenges that African governments are facing is a lack of compliance with policy directives . In some cases , the lack of compliance is not a result of disobedience , but rather structural and systemic factors unique to African countries . For instance , preventive measures , such as social distancing , are difficult to implement in informal settlements and slums where in many cases , families of six share one 20 square meter room . Also , informal sector jobs can not be performed remotely . In light of this , extreme measures are likely to cause widespread social and humanitarian problems , as seen in places like India , where a nation-wide lockdown was instituted with a mere four hours notice . In contrast , responses by several African countries , such as Angola , Senegal , Rwanda , Ghana , and Kenya , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments can offer free basic services to vulnerable communities , including providing survival packs that can cater to daily needs and working with existing organizations -- private sector and NGOs -- who have distribution networks that are able to deliver at the last mile . African governments should lobby for debt relief , and suspension of short-term payments on sovereign bonds to free up money for more urgent needs . African countries can also take advantage of regional and continental channels to collaborate with each other and exchange information on solutions that have proven/are proving to be effective . Countries that have extensive experience in battling tough epidemics , in particular , could offer valuable lessons . <p> Finally , it will not be possible to implement any solution without effective , broad-based communication . In places like the UAE , religious leaders and institutions have used their reach and influence to disseminate critical public health messaging . Community-level engagement using village and other community elders is likely to be effective in circulating messages on preventive measures , as well as monitoring key developments in a localized manner . Offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working and widespread access to information .

@@61759441 <h> 13 of the Most Deadly Diseases in Human History <p> Amid the far-reaching global impact of the coronavirus , Bill Gates recently described COVID-19 as the " once-in-a-century pathogen we 've been worried about . " After the recent explosions of case numbers over the last couple of weeks , and as confirmed by Bill Gates in his article for the New England Journal of Medicine , COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on our planet . This is not just because of the quarantine but because of how dangerous the virus is . <p> " There are two reasons that COVID-19 is such a threat . First , it can kill healthy adults in addition to elderly people with existing health problems , " says Gates . " The data so far suggest that the virus has a case fatality risk around 1% ; this rate would make it many times more severe than typical seasonal influenza , putting it somewhere between the 1957 influenza pandemic ( 0.6% ) and the 1918 influenza pandemic ( 2% ) . " <p> Currently , there are 1,364,271COVID-19 cases , 76,439 deaths , and 293,843 recovered patients . Physical distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease . Though things are up in the air regarding when the world will return to normal , if history has taught us anything , humanity will make it through this , with researchers working day and night to develop treatments . <p> As you have probably recently learned , contagious diseases have shaped the world and our history , impacting the environment , global economies , and even how humans evolve . Today we are going to explore some of the world 's most infectious diseases . <h> 1 . Ebola <p> Do you remember the Ebola scare a couple of years ago ? Though the disease is very rare , it is extremely deadly , often a fatal infection to those who get it . Caused by one of five strains , the Ebola virus usually spreads through a human 's bodily fluids with most people getting the disease by touching the surfaces of clothing that are contaminated by these fluids . Ebola is known to spread extremely fast , rapidly taking over the body 's immune system causing muscle pain , headaches , weakness , diarrhea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . <p> With an average fatality rate of about 50%and with a case fatality rate varying from 25% to 90% , Ebola is truly terrifying . A recent outbreak of Ebola caught the world 's attention in 2014 and lasted until 2016 . As many as 11,325 people died during the outbreak while 28,652 people said to have been infected by the disease . <p> In 2018 , there was also another outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that took the lives of well over 2,000 people . Combating Ebola is not easy as there is no proven treatment for the virus . Yet , there are currently experimental vaccines and treatments being tested to combat future outbreaks . <h> 2 . Marburg virus <p> First identified in 1967 , the Marburg virus shares some similarities with ebola because of its ability to also cause hemorrhagic fever . In short , this means that people that have the Marburg virus suffer from similar symptoms like fever and bleeding throughout the body . If not properly treated , the disease can lead to a series of organ failures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lab , the mortality rate hovered around 25% . Yet , when the disease reappeared between 1998- 2000 , that number skyrocketed to above 80%. <h> 3 . Smallpox <p> Some researchers have argued that Smallpox could make a comeback . Yet , as of 1980 , the World Health Assembly declared that the world is smallpox free . Historically , smallpox is considered to be one of the most dangerous and historic diseases . Caused by the variola virus , the disease produces a characteristic rash , particularly on the face , arms and legs . Before the vaccine in the 1980s , Smallpox existed for 3,000 years and was one of the most feared diseases in history . Only in the 20th century , smallpox is believed to have killed 300 million people . Smallpox is still talked about as both the WHO and countless governments around the world believe that viruses could be deliberately released to cause harm . <h> 4 . Dengue <p> Mosquito-borne diseases kill millions of people each year . One of the most devastating diseases affecting the world is Dengue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . The viral infection appears in its victim after being transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito , with symptoms usually appearing 3-14 days after the infective bite . Even more so the disease affects people of all ages as each person battles flu-like symptoms , which at times can lead to dengue hemorrhagic fever , which could also include symptoms that include fever , abdominal pain , vomiting , bleeding , and trouble in breathing . At the moment there are no treatments for Dengue. <h> 5 . Hantavirus <p> Also known as HPS , Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome caught the attention of the United States back in 1993 when a healthy young man died of the disease after only a couple days of experiencing shortness of breath . The rare but very deadly disease is caused by a virus that a person gets from getting in contact with the droppings , saliva , or urine of a rodent . People who have been unfortunate enough to get the disease have experienced fever , chills , muscle aches , or gastrointestinal symptoms . Thankfully the researchers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man . Yet there have been 600 cases in the U.S. of people contracting HPS with a 36% mortality rate . <h> 6 . Meningitis <p> It is one of the most terrifying diseases on this list . Referring to the inflammation of the meninges , or the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord , the disease can be caused by a wide array of things that include but are not limited to fungi , viruses , and bacteria . Viral meningitis can be spread through the sharing of bodily fluids . Even kissing can spread bacterial meningitis . When not treated immediately meningitis can have a mortality rate as high as 50%. <h> 7 . Malaria <p> Another mosquito based disease , the world health organization has estimated that there have been 228 million cases of malaria in 2018 alone , with most cases occurring in the African Region . About 405,000 people died in 2018 from this curable and preventable disease due to the massive influx of mosquitoes in the region . The parasite makes its way from mosquito to host , causing those infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to serious complications . At the moment , leading private organizations , WHO , and governments are working hard to dramatically drop the number of cases of the infected each year . <h> 8 . SARS <p> SARS , the severe acute respiratory syndrome , caused the deaths of 750 people in a pandemic in 2002 and 2003 . The current belief is that just like other deadly diseases like Ebola virus , Marburg virus , and MERS , the disease originated from bats , with the first infected appearing in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002 . Symptoms of the disease include fever , malaise , myalgia , headache , diarrhea , and shivering. <h> 9 . Influenza <p> During a typical season , up to 500,000 people worldwide die from Influenza . However , as we have seen new flu strains emerge causing a massive pandemic . One of the most deadly cases of flu to happen in recent history is the 1918 Spanish flu that sickened up to global 40% of the population eventually killing about 50 million people . Though some have argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for , there is still a chance that we could experience a pandemic much worse than COVID-19 in the coming years . Simple things like washing your hands and getting a regular flu shot can help combat standard influenza. <h> 10 . Cholera <p> When untreated , Cholera can be extremely deadly , killing within hours . Acute diarrhoeal infection is caused by eating or drinking food or water that is contaminated with the bacterium " Vibrio cholera " and is one of the most deadly diseases in developing countries . It is believed that there are 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of cholera with death numbers expected to be somewhere between 21,000 - 143,000 . Upon drinking or eating infected food , symptoms tend to appear within 12 hours to 5 days . WHO is working on preventing cholera in countries is by collaborating with organizations to provide clean water and sanitation facilities . <h> 11 . HIV <p> Throughout the world , HIV is considered to be one of the deadliest viruses . Human immunodeficiency virus is considered by the World Health Organization to be a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 32 million people since it has been discovered . The virus targets the immune system destroying crucial cells in the body , drastically inhibiting your body from fighting infection . The cells , also known as CD4 cells , are hijacked by HIV replicating themselves inside in CD4 destroying the cells . <p> The good news is , there have been a lot of great breakthroughs in HIV research . According to the WHO , almost 40 million people are living with the disease , with a large portion of the infected able to manage it and live with it . Moreover , 2 people have just been cured of what was once thought of as the incurable disease thanks to a stem cell transplant . <h> 12 . Rabies <p> Though rabies is not that big of a threat in the west , with most people having complete access to rabies vaccines for pets , in places like India or Africa rabies is a serious issue . The viral disease directly attacks the nervous system , affecting any warm-blooded animals , usually coming in contact with is salvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entering of an existing wound . Interestingly , 40% of people bitten by suspected rabid animals are children under 15 years of age , while 99% of rabies transmissions are from dogs to humans . By 2030 , the World Health organization aims to get human rabies-related deaths down to zero . <h> Plague <p> As we mentioned above , smallpox is erased from the world . However , the following ancient killer is still very much with us appearing in places around the world . Plague is an infectious disease responsible for wiping out about 33% of the population in Europe during the 14th century , about 50 million people . It is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis carried by small mammals and their fleas . <p> Taking septicaemic and pneumonic forms the deadly disease can have a case-fatality ratio of 30% - 100% if left untreated . Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo , Madagascar , and Peru have all reported cases of Plague . In fact from 2010 to 2015 there were 3248 cases and 584 deaths reported worldwide . <p> Be sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quarantine .

To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets or favourite walking routes are not strewn with litter . Unfortunately , there is a small minority who still throw rubbish around and are now discarding plastic gloves or empty plastic sanitizer bottles . To help us in our endeavour to keep our areas litter free , we ask you to dispose of any such items in your rubbish bin at home or at the nearest street bin . In particular , we wish to remind dog owners to use the bags available from the mutt dispensers units when taking their dogs out walking to prevent dog fouling . Dumping of waste is a blight on our environment and in recent days , we have encountered illegal dumping in the countryside . This poses a threat to our water quality and public health . We know that some households are doing some spring cleaning and we wish to remind you that our civic amenity sites across the county are open and will accept a wide range of items , some items are free of charge . Members of the public are asked to be vigilant of any illegal dumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such activity by contacting our customer services team at 0761 06 5000 or by email to **33;1276;TOOLONG Our enforcement officers are investigating such incidents and there are in excess of 20 covert CCTV cameras operational across the county as well a mobile CCTV unit . Please take these small actions to keep your county litter free and stay safe .

The projections take into consideration studies already done on the disease that shows the effects of the virus on the aged , individuals with underlying health conditions as well as its effect on different sexes .

Studies conducted in China , Italy and Spain , some of the worst hit countries , show the possibility of death from the disease increases with age , especially after 65 years . Other than age , the sex of a person also matters since while both men and women can get infected , men tend to have worse disease outcomes . In some places , the proportion of men to women dying from the disease has been found to be 70 per cent . <p> Kenya , like the rest of the developing world , has a few health peculiarities that may make the pandemic worse .

As far as cancer is concerned , Kenya gets 47,887 new cases yearly and has a prevalence of 86,596 . Of these , the Kenya Network of Cancer Organisation estimates that 40 per cent occur in people over 70 years old . Just like with the other diseases , assuming an infection rate of 60 per cent among cancer patients , the number likely to be affected will be 51,957 . Then there is hypertension , commonly referred to as the silent killer . Last year , the Ministry of Health estimated that 25 per cent of Kenyans could be living with the condition . Only 1 in 6 of the estimated cased have , however , been diagnosed . Hence , total number of diagnosed hypertensives in Kenya are only one sixth of 25 per cent of the population . This translates to 1,981,845 , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then there is the little matter of the quality of air in our cities that has made it worse for people living with chronic respiratory diseases . Although the number of people in Kenya living with respiratory diseases is not well documented , WHO estimates that it could be as high as seven per cent of the entire population , or in Kenya 's case , 3,329,500 people . A 60 per cent infection rate will mean that 1,997,700 people might contract the disease . Thus in a full-blown epidemic , a total number of 4,996,740 people could be infected with the disease ; a figure that combines the totals of the aged population , known diabetics , those battling cancer , those with hypertension and individuals with respiratory disorders . All these will present severe forms of Covid-19 in a full-blown epidemic . It is , however , possible that more than one of the determinants of disease severity exist in one person . A person could be over 65 years old diabetic and as well as hypertensive ; then the number of people likely to suffer severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of 4,996,740 . This brings down the number to some 1,665,580 people at risk of severe Covid-19 . With this projection , and still on the assumption of a 50 per cent death rate of those showing symptoms will become severe , the best case scenario for deaths for Kenya would be 1,665,580 x 0.5 = 832,790 . This would be a case fatality rate of 2.9 per cent , assuming a 60 per cent infection rate in the population . Then there is the worst case scenario where complication brought about by the country 's HIV infections as well as malnutrition could add on to the statistics . " The worst case scenario would be that HIV and malnutrition complicate the situation further adding an additional 2,907,890 people to those over 65 years of age bringing the total number of those at risk of severe disease to some 4,573,470 people , " he says . Again , working with a case fatality rate of 50 per cent , this will result in some 2,286,735 deaths countrywide . Speaking to The Standard , Prof Osur , however , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people get sick at the same time . " If too many people get sick at once , the health care system gets overwhelmed . This is when deaths rise dramatically , " he says . Current statistics , however , do not tally with the gloomy study that was released on Good Friday . To date , Kenya has recorded 208 cases and nine deaths . Detected posthumously Osur says there might be an explanation for this . " First , we are not testing enough people to know at which stage of the pandemic we are currently in . Only numbers will tell us how far we are from a full-blown pandemic , " he says . " But there have been some signs . We have had Covid-19 cases detected posthumously . This shows the numbers could be much higher than we are currently aware of . " The study , titled The Number of Kenyans Likely to Suffer Severe Illness and Death Should Kenya Experience a Full Blown Covid-19 Outbreak , makes a few key assumptions . The first is that severe disease will only happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease has been seen even in people without risks . " Further , the calculations assume that only a maximum of 60 per cent of people in any segment of population gets infected . This has been noted in the West and may not apply in Africa , " Osur says . The other assumption is that the Kenyan healthcare system will handle the disease in the same way it is handled in western countries and limit deaths to 50 per cent of those with severe disease . The study recommends that the Ministry of Health continues to institute radical measures to control the spread of the infection . " Slowing down the rate of infection will help the health system cope better with patient influx and post better survival rates , " says Osur . <p> Do not miss out on the latest news .

A football and a garden at home in Skibbereen helped lay the foundations for what 's been a meteoric rise through the club , divisional and inter-county ranks . <p> But what makes O'Mahony 's ascension even more remarkable is the fact she did n't start training or playing football competitively until 2010 . <p> ' Gymnastics was the main sport I was interested in when I was younger , ' O'Mahony told The Southern Star . <p> ' I never had a huge love for any of the sports I was involved in and quit most of them back then . I 'd always be begging for a football at home and began kicking it against a wall or back and forth with my Dad . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a case of practising in the garden every day . I was very imaginative and used to have imaginary friends that I 'd be playing away with !

I used to go to those training sessions and that helped improve my skills as I got involved in all the drills and games . <p> ' Looking back , and for someone that plays football at a high level now , I was a late starter . Some of the Cork girls are shocked when I tell them I only began playing football properly about ten years ago . ' <p> Three epic U12 county championship encounters with Carrigaline brought O'Mahony and O'Donovan Rossa on leaps and bounds . The sides could n't be separated after a U12 county semi-final and two subsequent replays went to extra-time . Heartbreakingly , Skibbereen lost in the third and final meeting by a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable lesson . <p> ' Those ( three ) county championship matches really brought us ( O'Donovan Rossa ) on even though we were devastated to lose in the end , ' the 19-year-old remembered . <p> ' We knew we were in each of those games but , even at U12 , the disappointment of losing by a point was hard to deal with . At a young age , we would have been watching Cork win all their All-Irelands and kind of expected that we were going to win ourselves at some stage . That was n't the case though . <p> ' Likewise , losing last year 's All-Ireland semi-final to Dublin just shows you all the hard work you put in , sometimes , does not mean you are going to win . You just have to come back stronger and work harder than ever . ' <p> Every child needs a hero to look up to .

O'Mahony had moved to the city and established herself as one of the Cork seniors ' most consistent performers during the league campaign despite being deployed in an unfamiliar half-back role . <p> But the Covid-19 outbreak altered everything . Adhering to HSE guidelines , O'Mahony is currently back at home in Skibb along with her mother Deirdre , father James and older sister Grace . <p> ' I remember being in UCC 's Western Gateway campus building when Leo Varadkar 's speech came on television , ' O'Mahony commented . <p> ' Everyone watching realised the seriousness of what was happening .

My course is more continuous assessment-based anyway so I 'm lucky . ' Determined , hard-working and focussed , O'Mahony possessed all the necessary traits to become an inter-county footballer before making the breakthrough last year . <p> Cork boss Ephie Fitzgerald had been keeping a close eye on the attacking half-forward at minor level and gave O'Mahony her chance . She grabbed her opportunity . <p> ' Growing up , I was never the one relied on to get all the scores for my club or West Cork even though I mostly played half-forward or midfield , ' O'Mahony noted . <p> ' I was often complimented on my tackling ability over the years but never paid much attention to it .

I do n't think I did too bad and it gave me the confidence that I could play in that position . ' <p> Despite Covid-19 , the signs in the opening rounds of the league were that O'Mahony is ready to make her mark at county level . <p> In 2017 she made history as the first player from O'Donovan Rossa Ladies GAA Club to win an All-Ireland medal following her success with the Cork minors and now she 's close to earning her spot in the senior team .

ILLUSTRATION JOHN NYAGA NMG <h> In Summary <p> *Covid-19 should jolt us up to the fact that it ca n't be business as usual . Our health research effort must be urgently , institutionally rationalised , prioritised and adequately funded . <p> The measures taken so far in Uganda and many other African countries to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic appear to be quite tentative and do n't provide a pathway back to normal functioning within and between countries . <p> Measures that have been universally undertaken for curtailing the spread and effectively managing the infected persons are important for two main reasons : <p> First , to buy time for vaccines and effective medicines to be developed , the reality being that sooner or later nearly everybody will get the infection , just like we get flu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare capacity , which would lead to a high rate of deaths . <p> The next steps to take following the general behavioural changes being adopted by the public such as social distancing , washing hands with soap , safe coughing and sneezing , must be driven by scientific information and knowledge . <p> That information and knowledge will be provided by investigation and research . The first and obvious starting point is to determine those infected by the virus and , hence , capable of passing it on to others . <p> Similarly , to determine those who have been infected , overcome the infection and developed immunity against the virus . <p> The second area of scientific investigation and research is one that creates capacity to immunise the population and to have effective drugs to cure the infection . <p> Majority of those who get infected either do n't get any symptoms at all or get mild symptoms that do n't alarm them to get tested . <p> These infected , but untested , people will remain interacting freely with the public and potentially spreading the virus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have immunity are also unknown . Such people would no longer , generally , be under threat of getting infected , due to their immunity . <p> It means that such people could go back to their businesses without fear of getting sick and/or infecting others . <p> In order to know such people , a different type of test is needed ; one that tests for antibodies against the virus in the blood . <p> It 's important and urgent that we develop the capacity to test widely , both for the virus and for the antibodies ( immunity ) . All our major health facilities should be checking for Covid-19 . <p> The real end of Covid-19 threat will come from developing effective and safe vaccines and curative drugs . <p> Once the infective agent is clearly understood , as the Covid-19 now is , the processes for developing vaccines are well known , it takes competent human resource , funding to develop the necessary facilities and time . <p> This is an area in which our African or sub-regional countries would be pooling , both human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

This information would then be pooled into databases from which widely effective vaccines are developed . <p> So far , different countries have done more than 7,700 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 .

I 'm playing week-in , week-out , I 'm still at university . And then we just signed Andy Powell so that 'll be great off the pitch ' . <p> " Anyway , he signed and the first trip we had away with him was away in Brive .

@@61804041 <h> During a pandemic , access to accurate and current information is key . <p> Data sharing is more important than ever under the current coronavirus pandemic , says Andrew Brown , Deputy Managing Executive for Altron HealthTech . Interestingly enough , one of the key tenets of the government 's mooted National Health Insurance is that public and private healthcare be able to share patient data as the person moves through the system . It goes without saying that this data should be secured and only shared with the patient 's permission , adds Brown . <p> However , the NHI is only due to come into force in 2026 , while the current COVID-19 pandemic is highlighting more than ever that the healthcare sector needs to relook at how it manages patient data , sooner rather than later . There also needs to be increasing focus on the quality of data in that patient data must be captured correctly from the outset in order to create a unique patient identifier . <p> All healthcare practitioners , regardless of whether they 're public or private sector , face an enormous challenge around capturing patient information accurately . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to capture their information , suggests Brown . Regardless of how they manage it , going forward , as envisioned by the NHI , private and public sector healthcare providers will need to be able to share salient patient data , which will have to be managed in a secure and compliant fashion , he says . <p> Does that mean COVID-19 is bringing the NHI deadline forward ? Well , it could certainly help prepare the healthcare system for its implementation , according to Brown . However , it 's unclear where the money is going to come from to pay for the implementation of solutions required to enable the type of data sharing that 's envisioned . The COVID-19 lockdown is costing the South African economy an estimated R13 billion a day . The economic implications are huge , impacting businesses of all sizes , creating unprecedented unemployment and the resulting decline in tax collection . " The government is going to need to spend money to get the NHI up and running , but where will it come from ? We need the NHI sooner rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dream unaffordable . " <p> The digitisation of patient data and the ability to share that data holds benefits for healthcare providers , those who pay for the healthcare ( either medical aids or government ) and patients alike . The aim is to digitise interaction across these three parties , improving communication to provide more cost-effective and better quality healthcare to the patient , states Brown . <p> The pandemic means the patient 's world had changed significantly . Instead of arriving at their GP 's rooms and sitting in the waiting room to see a doctor who is invariably running late , they want to book their appointment online , fill in their demographic details at the same time and be told how late the physician is running so they can wait at home or in their car . Nobody wants to sit in a waiting room full of sick people . <p> Telemedicine guidelines are changing to allow doctors to consult with existing patients remotely . A repeat prescription can be issued digitally and the medicines couriered to the patient 's house . However , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare professionals capture information electronically so it can be shared . Health complications as a result of COVID-19 might require referrals between practitioners -- such as pathology or radiology -- and ongoing care to get people back to full health . This team of caregivers will require visibility into a single clinical record for that patient . Results can be shared with the patient via virtual session . All of this reduces the risk of cross-contamination , which is as relevant for the patient as it is for the healthcare provider , who does n't wish to risk either their own or their employees ' health . <p> For this reason , healthcare providers are big proponents of telemedicine solutions . Being on the frontline , they are most likely to get infected . While telemedicine is convenient for patients in that they can get on with their day while waiting for their appointment to happen , it has now become a safety consideration for healthcare professionals , driven by the pandemic , says Brown . <p> There 's a growing need for on-demand healthcare , digitisation and accessibility -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to drive innovation so patients can have access to physicians using their smartphones . Putting more data about their health into the hands of patients is a major driver of innovation in this space . <p> For the payers , access to good quality data means they can better manage their member population . By providing them with detailed information about every COVID-19 patient being seen by a general practitioner , they could develop care and treatment plans to pre-empt people having to be admitted to hospital . Having access to information would enable them to do a better job of protecting their fund and the rest of their insured patients . <p> The ability to better manage costs while getting treatment plans out as quickly as possible equally applies to the public sector . The hospitals just ca n't cope with the numbers of patients that are turning up , so if they have advanced warning in the form of up-to-date , accurate information , they can plan around anticipated patient numbers , while also helping people to isolate themselves and self-medicate before they require hospitalisation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is where targeted digital campaigns come into their own . " <p> Patients just arrive at public hospitals and queue to see a healthcare provider ; it 's very difficult to enforce social distancing under these conditions . These patients should also be able to make an appointment and be told what time they should enter the facility , so they can remain at home until the time of their appointment . Alternatively , Brown proposes that a ticketing system could be implemented , where people are allocated a number in the queue and told roughly what time to return . <p> The one key aspect of the current pandemic , and one that keeps being raised , is access to up-to-date data . Currently there 's a three- to four-day lag in the data , which means the statistics around infection rates are a couple of days old . Brown says digitisation could reveal whether the National Health Laboratory Service is doing sufficient testing compared to private pathology labs , for example . <p> " Faster test results will make a big difference to understanding how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronically so it can be fed into a centralised database for collation . For this to be effective , the country need to establish a really basic electronic health record for the public and private sector that includes basic information about the patient , what they were diagnosed with and the medication prescribed . The data already exists , in many instances , but what 's needed is a national standard where it 's submitted into a centralised database . The NHI will ultimately require this in order for healthcare providers to be paid for their services . <p> " This is where the big data really comes into its own , " he adds , " identifying where to deploy providers , where to do more screening , which areas are running out of tests and getting the right medication to the right areas on time .

They said they were deeply concerned about the impact the lockdown was having on children 's access to food . <p> Before the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown , about 6.4million children in the country lived below the food poverty line . <p> The organisations said in the absence of an income and food relief , for many poor households during this time of economic recession the number of children who go hungry will increase by the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Social Development and Education to establish what plans the government has to ensure children have access to basic nutrition . <p> They said more than 9million children normally benefit from the national school nutrition programme and other feeding schemes . <p> For many of these children the food they received at school or at one of the educational centres is often their only meal of the day . <p> Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga earlier indicated that the department was not going to run feeding schemes at the schools or educational centres during the lockdown as it did not have the capacity to do so . <p> The organisations said the minister , instead deferred the issue to the Department of Social Development and said her department would help in providing families in need with food . <p> Karabo Ozah of the Centre for Child Law and the others , however , believe it was not clear what this support would entail . <p> They took note of the government 's initiatives to distribute food to the needy , but said these drives did not come close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding schemes . <p> At best , they said , the food parcel programmes were estimated to reach a maximum of a million households .

" <p> Despite these concerns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalition launched 106 air strikes . The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect has described such attacks as " indiscriminate bombing of civilians " . <p> Declassified UK has found that while the recent sorties were underway , British arms industry giant BAE Systems flew a cargo plane ( tail number G-JMCM ) from its Typhoon fighter jet factory at Warton Aerodrome , England , to the RAF 's Akrotiri air base in Cyprus on 15 April 2020 where it refuelled and stayed overnight . <p> The cargo plane then proceeded to Ta'if , near Mecca in Saudi Arabia , the following day . BAE staff at King Fahad Air Base in Ta'if service a fleet of Typhoon fighter jets used by the Saudi air force to bomb Yemen . <p> A few hours after landing in Ta'if , the BAE freighter returned along the same route to Warton , arriving on 17 April .

The model of aircraft used by BAE , a Boeing 737-300 freighter , can hold eight large cargo containers on its main deck . <p> Declassified UK has also found that in April alone BAE has advertised at least five vacancies for expatriates to help support the Saudi air force . BAE employs about 6,500 people across Saudi Arabia , of which approximately 30% are expatriates . <p> The job adverts include one for an instructor to train Saudi Arabian military pilots how to fly Hawk jets at King Faisal air base in Tabuk , close to Jordan .

BAE is assisted in Saudi Arabia by about 100 serving UK military personnel , mostly drawn from the RAF , under a scheme known as the Ministry of Defence Saudi Armed Forces Projects ( MODSAP ) which earns the UK government ? 60-million per year from the Saudi regime . <p> Without Britain 's technical expertise , the Saudi air force would be out of service in less than a fortnight , according to a former BAE employee who spoke to Channel 4 Dispatches . In addition to Ta'if and Tabuk , other MODSAP sites include the Saudi capital of Riyadh , Khamis Mushayt near the border with Yemen , Jubail and Dhahran on the Gulf coast , and Jeddah on the Red Sea coast . <p> The MOD told Declassified UK it would not specify how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons of operational security " and did not answer our questions about whether it was appropriate for the RAF to continue its support for Saudi Arabia 's air force during a pandemic . <p> He added that they have also " provided generic training support " to Saudi pilots , but the RAF did not monitor how their students went on to use the skills they learned . <p> The MOD claims its role does not amount to " direct support " for Saudi sorties in Yemen because RAF personnel " do not prepare " Saudi aircraft for operations , either by " loading " weapons or planning attacks . <p> However , the government has admitted that UK personnel store and issue weapons for use by the Saudi air force , load weapons for its training missions and participate in training exercises with the Saudi air force .

Last week , an RAF transport plane flew from Cyprus to Al Minhad air field in Dubai -- UAE 's biggest city -- where the RAF has a permanent presence . The UAE has also hired British mercenaries to assist its Presidential Guard unit which has fought in Yemen . <p> ' Cruel irony ' <p> While helping to bomb Yemen , both the RAF and BAE are assisting Britain 's National Health Service ( NHS ) to tackle Covid-19 in the UK . The RAF has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopters available to help NHS Trusts in Scotland reach Covid-19 patients in remote parts of the country . This week , an RAF plane collected surgical gowns from Turkey . <p> BAE is supplying protective visors and ventilators to the NHS , claiming it wants to " help in any way " to stop Covid-19 . Some BAE staff , who make parts for the Typhoon fighter jet , have been diverted towards printing 3D face shields for healthcare workers in the UK . <p> British-Yemeni lawyer Rehab Jaffer told Declassified UK that BAE 's actions were a " cruel irony " . She said : " In the midst of a pandemic , they make breathing apparatus for one nation , whilst sending military aid to another , for use against a country that is suffering the world 's worst humanitarian crisis .

In 2014 , BAE employed six British and three South African doctors to provide healthcare to MODSAP personnel , their spouses and children at facilities in Riyadh , Dhahran , Ta'if and Tabuk . <p> BAE employs so many expatriate staff in Saudi Arabia that it has built vast compounds to accommodate them and their MOD counterparts . The Salwa Garden Village in Riyadh has 73 units available to MOD personnel , including a " super executive villa " , and BAE 's Sara compound near Dhahran has 952 residential units with 25 set aside for the UK 's MOD . Facilities include schools , swimming pools , a bowling alley , squash and tennis courts . <p> This degree of investment has seen Saudi Arabia become BAE 's third largest market after the US and UK . BAE has sold ? 15-billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia since the conflict with Yemen started in 2015 , according to Campaign Against Arms Trade ( CAAT ) . The company 's annual report published in April 2020 noted : " Saudi Arabia has a strong commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> In 2019 , CAAT successfully obtained a Court of Appeal ruling preventing UK ministers from granting new export licences for weapons that might be used in the bombing of Yemen .

Following the extension of the lockdown , many were hoping this ban would be relaxed but they were disappointed on April 16 when this was firmly denied . <p> The managing director of MasterDrive , Eugene Herbert , said one area where the ban on alcohol can have a drastic impact is in the cost of alcohol-related accidents on the gross domestic product ( GDP ) . <p> " Research from the government and public-health sector says the annual tangible and intangible cost to the country of alcohol-related harm is between 10% and 12% of the country 's GDP . <p> " What percentage of this can be specifically attributed to car crashes is not stated .

@@61820341 <h> OP-ED <h> After the virus : What are Africa 's chances of recovery ? <p> Members of the Sonko Rescue Team , an NGO founded by Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko , use smoke machines to spray streets and surfaces as they conduct a fumigation exercise during curfew at a local city market and its main streets in order to fight the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic in Nairobi , Kenya , 15 April 2020 . ( Photo : EPA-EFE/Daniel Irungu ) <h> Today 's trillion-dollar question is : What will the post-Covid-19 world look like ? Will the world indeed deglobalise , will supply chains shorten and what will all of this mean for Africa 's many already-fragile economies ? <p> Over the last few weeks , there has been a multitude of predictions on the size and scope of the economic upset caused by Covid-19 . The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) predicts the global economy will contract by 3% in 2020 , making the " great lockdown the worst recession since the Great Depression , and far worse than the Global Financial Crisis " . <p> McKinsey , for example , finds that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three to eight percentage point cut to GDP growth , up to a $200-billion decline , notwithstanding the effects of currency devaluations , inflationary pressure , or declining credit ratings , all of which could further worsen the economic outlook . <p> Economists are usually more cautious to predict good things . However , a global reset does not have to be a bad thing for Africa if it can use this crisis as an opportunity for much-needed economic reform , and in so doing reposition itself to take advantage of a changed global order . <p> The first step , as pointed out , is thus to face up to the crisis and turn it around . As with South Africa , even before Covid-19 , the rest of the African continent faced tremendous challenges , on the cusp of seismic demographic change ; not just numbers , but also in distribution , as the world 's fastest urbanising region . Over half of the population of sub-Saharan Africa is today under 25 , half of whom are unemployed , accounting for 60% of all the continent 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Kenyan woman together with her son wear face masks during Easter Sunday as churches remained closed forcing most worshippers to stay home in Mathare slums , in Nairobi , Kenya , 12 April 2020 . ( Photo : EPA-EFE/DANIEL IRUNGU ) <p> Finding a way out of this situation was never going to be easy , and Covid-19 has just made it much harder . Before the crisis , the IMF , for instance , estimated that Africa needed to create nearly 20 million high-value jobs each year just to keep up with the number of young people coming into the African job market . <p> Enabling an economic recovery while dealing with a backlog of problems like unemployment and poverty will depend primarily on Africa 's ability to access finance -- both investment and loans . <p> However , many countries are already at a dangerously high level of indebtedness . In 2019 , the majority of sub-Saharan African countries ( 38 of 47 ) registered a fiscal deficit . The World Bank estimates that the region would need an additional stimulus of $100-billion " including an estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The IMF has , for instance , announced $1-trillion in financial firepower to help the global response to Covid-19 , $100-billion of which is earmarked for low-income and emerging countries . Ten-year interest-free loans have already been announced for lower-income countries , including Rwanda , Senegal and Madagascar . The World Bank has also announced that $160-billion will be available over the next 15 months . The African Development Bank ( AfDB ) is also providing substantial capital , including via a $3-billion social bond . <p> There are a number of possible threats to this funding scenario . The prospects of global recovery -- and the normalisation of globalisation -- depends on a range of political factors , centred on the US-China relationship . The possibility of a globalisation reset could be increased by a number of events : The use of an anti-China platform by President Donald Trump during the 2020 election ( a near certainty ) or a more aggressive response by China , including over Taiwan , in the South China Sea , or in Hong Kong . There is a global , strategic aspect as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No matter the schadenfreude of some over the globalisation reset , there is a clear connection between the health of global capital flows , and the ability of African countries to fund their way out of this crisis . <p> What this means , simply , is those who can best access funds , and put those funds to good use , will be in the strongest position to benefit from the new world order , which will include some potential upsides for African countries . <p> First , they could position themselves to benefit from the moderation of " one country risk " ( especially to China ) in global supply chains and practice diversification . As Joerg Wuttke , president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China recently put it , " single source is out and diversification is in " . <p> Despite increased continental trade openness overall , the level of integration in global value chains in Africa is one-third lower than other developing regions . Changing this requires diversification of investment types away from traditional concentration in extractive sectors to more light manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A drive for diversification is all the more imperative in Africa 's commodity-producing states post-Covid-19 as they seek to reduce export vulnerabilities and increase job opportunities . <p> Africa 's relative performers might also encourage greater aid flows through increased policy differentiation , in particular from the United States , already the largest donor to Africa , contributing $11.2-billion of $53-billion annually ( with the European Union providing the second-largest volume of some $7-billion ) , to ramp up economic growth and job creation . <p> China has already made headway with its belt and road infrastructure initiative across developing and into developed markets . The pandemic offers it the opportunity to present itself as a humanitarian ally , and Africa could also leverage its position including the treatment of its nationals in China , to improve terms of aid and trade . There have already been calls for Beijing to scrap the $140-billion in debt that African countries have taken out with China since 2000 as partial compensation to African countries for the impact of Covid-19 . <p> Secondly , there may be another unexpected upside for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Covid-19 better than older ones . The global south should , given the right conditions , be somewhere to invest . But much will depend on how Africa survives the crisis , the extent to which it is able to de-risk investments and how it positions itself to profit from this new order . <p> A global reset does not have to be a bad thing for Africa if it learns to own its problems and be their solution . The imperative for African leadership resolve , national resilience and a drive for competitiveness can not be understated . But it is a situation of move quickly or be damned .

@@61826441 <p> With no circuit racing on until at least July , Motorsport UK has pitched in to help organisers facing a difficult time balancing the books . But there are many uncertainties that need to be considered before club racing can return to normality <p> In a world without coronavirus , the UK motorsport season would have been well underway by now . <p> Prior to this weekend , there should have already been 26 national race meetings held across the UK and Ireland and the vast majority of series would have completed at least their opening event . Some categories would be deep into the campaign already - this weekend was due to feature the third round of the British Touring Car Championship and its support series , for example . <p> But the COVID-19 pandemic has meant none of that has been possible . Governing body Motorsport UK suspended all its event permits until 30 June on the eve of the season starting . This means the long winter period where circuit racing organisers do not run any events has been massively extended . And the timing of the outbreak has made matters especially difficult for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened at a worse time , " says Ken Davies , chairman of the Castle Combe Racing Club . " What some people do n't realise is a racing club has a six-month window to generate all of its income and then a six-month period where it has to live on what it 's been able to generate . <p> " All revenue stops until racing starts again the next April . " <p> So this year , instead of the difficult winter time for clubs lasting from November until April , it will continue until at least July and possibly even longer than that . Inevitably , such a long fallow period is going to have an impact , and clubs up and down the country are now working to minimise the effects of the coronavirus outbreak . <p> Motorsport UK is helping with that too , by offering a ? 1million fund to support struggling clubs through this difficult spell . The scheme allows clubs to apply for grants of up to ? 10,000 or loans of up to ? 25,000 but these are available as a last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Motorsport UK chairman David Richards ( pictured below ) says it is important for the governing body to be proactive in helping clubs during this crisis . <p> " I 've seen some correspondence with the FIA whereby it looks like our fund and our mechanism for launching it is going to be set as a template for others around the world " David Richards <p> " Any decent organisation or sporting body should have the interest of its members at the front and should be anticipating the problems they are going to have down the line - not just reacting to them and not just waiting for someone to write to us and say ' by the way we 've got problems here , what can you do about it ? ' " he explains . <p> " The clubs have nowhere to go . Sport England have put together a significant fund but we ca n't access that - motorsport has never been able to access that - so we felt the only thing for us to do therefore was to put our own fund together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh Chambers , Motorsport UK CEO and his team have put the process together very quickly . They looked at it carefully and I 've seen some correspondence with the FIA whereby it looks like our fund and our mechanism for launching it is going to be set as a template for others around the world . " <p> Clubs have responded positively to the initiative - variously describing it as an " olive branch " , " very generous " and " a step in the right direction " . With or without Motorsport UK support , each club is unique and faces a subtly different set of circumstances and is therefore dealing with the crisis in a different way . For example , Davies believes the CCRC is well placed to ride this storm . <p> " Our overheads are pretty low , " he says . " Coincidentally , on the 12 March before the lockdown began I was at the circuit and we had a financial meeting and think we 're in good shape . " <p> Not all clubs are in such a position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs such as the British Automobile Racing Club and British Racing &amp; Sports Car Club have taken advantage of the government 's Job Retention Scheme , furloughing a significant proportion of staff . <p> But cutting back all expenditure is just one of the areas clubs have to consider at the moment . Ultimately , they are all racing clubs and their purpose is to organise motorsport events - and it is far from clear when they will be able to do so again . While many clubs are optimistic club racing can begin in July or August , some are planning for a range of different scenarios . <p> " I drew up three scenarios for the BRSCC 's executive team to work on . One was no racing this year , the second was we carry on racing with the same dates , and the third one is up in the air and see what dates come back from circuits . " <p> On the other hand , some clubs have decided not to get too far ahead in planning for particular scenarios given how rapidly the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , many still believed club racing would not be significantly affected by COVID-19 . <p> " I 'm a glass-half-full kind of guy and we have to work with what we have , " says Mark Baulch , competitions secretary of the MG Car Club , which has had to postpone three of its six meetings so far . " We continue to work with Donington Park being our first meeting of the year on 11-12 July . But it 's a changing picture all the time . <p> " If we get the green light , then we will make sure we 're in a position to go for the July meeting . Unlike some of the big sporting events in July like the Festival of Speed which has been postponed , we do n't have as much infrastructure to put in place so we can get that event off the ground fairly quickly . " <p> At present , it is impossible to tell if that MGCC event at Donington Park , along with scores of others in July , will take place as planned . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead on 19 July is expected imminently , and that could give clues to when the club-racing season will start . If it is not postponed , that bodes well for a July resumption of racing but if it joins the ever-growing list of events that are postponed or cancelled , then it would suggest the delay to the club racing season could be even longer . <p> Several race meetings were either cancelled or altered last year due to a shortage of marshals , and that situation could become even worse if a significant number of events are slotted into a short period of time <p> Daly is optimistic club racing can resume before some of the larger international events . <p> " The first race meetings may take place behind closed doors , which will lend itself to televised events or club racing , " he says . <p> But , regardless of whether it is July , August or later that racing does indeed resume , there are still three key factors that will influence how many club meetings can be rescheduled into those final few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that club meetings are likely to be towards the bottom of the pecking order when it comes to accommodating new dates for postponed events . Silverstone has talked of the possibility of holding multiple grands prix at the venue , given the majority of Formula 1 teams are based in this country - if such a move were to happen , then it could have a significant impact on club racing at the circuit . <p> There is an acceptance among clubs that , as well as international events , meetings that draw large crowds will be the priority when it comes to rescheduling . <p> " It all revolves around TOCA and British Superbikes - they 're going to be the first ones , " says Daly . <p> BARC general manager Ian Watson adds : " We as clubs need to be realistic . It 's going to be more beneficial for circuit owners to go with British Superbikes and the British Touring Car Championship . " <p> Track operators are also facing a difficult period , and it is therefore understandable for them to initially focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The biggest challenge would be making sure we have enough marshals and medical people , " he says . <p> And that point about doctors and rescue crews is significant too . <p> " Motorsport can not function without proper medical services , and it would be wrong to redirect that cover to motorsport or any sporting event until the government says we can have access to use paramedics and ambulances , " Davies says . " Lives come first . " <p> Richards also acknowledges this could be a problem and believes it is essential to properly recognise the role these medical staff play . <p> " It 's all very well saying the government has opened things up and said we can have sporting events in August - or whenever it happens to take place - but we 've got to remember a lot of people we rely upon to run our events have been on the frontline in this pandemic for the last few months , " says Richards . <p> " It will be a fairly tough time for them , that they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should recognise that and find ways of acknowledging that . " <p> There is one more factor that still needs to be considered - and it is one of the most important . Even if racing is allowed to resume in July or August , and clubs are able to secure the track time they seek , and there are enough marshals , officials and medical crews , the meetings still need drivers to race at them . <p> Given how coronavirus has financially impacted everyone in one way or another , whether sponsors or drivers themselves will be able to pay to participate in motorsport is the big unknown . <p> " One thing we need to take into account is people are going to be tight for money . Trying to fit two race meetings into a month wo n't necessarily work financially for some competitors " Ian Watson <p> " While we 've redesigned our calendar , we are also aware we have to rely on members ' appetite to go racing , " states Daly ( pictured below ) . " While the appetite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the financial resources to pick up their helmet . <p> " At club level , there will be a lot of questions asked of families who , at this moment in time , are going through all the stress of having only 80% of their income . At the same time , there 's a lot of others who will be self-funded company directors going racing and asking whether they can justify their actions . " <p> Watson believes this is a factor that will determine how many of the postponed meetings end up getting new dates . <p> " The one thing we need to take into account is people are going to be tight for money , " he says . " I have to schedule one race meeting a month for my championships under normal circumstances , because that 's what people can afford , so trying to fit two race meetings into a month wo n't necessarily work financially for some competitors . <p> " We have to be realistic about what we can and ca n't do . " <p> At a time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 club racing season will be unlike any other . Even if a decent number of meetings do take place , Richards says there is no hiding from the fact that it 's a tough time for everyone . <p> " I would n't say a half-year is ever going to be considered a successful season , even if we can get up and running by July , " he says . " It could be we allow motorsport to happen for a while and then we have another clampdown because of the same circumstances we are in today . <p> " The one thing I am confident of is motor clubs in this country are robust organisations that really drive the grassroots of the sport and I know they will rally round .

So long as human interaction remains dangerous , business can not responsibly return to normal . And what was normal before may not be anymore . People may be less inclined to jam into crowded restaurants and concert halls even after the virus is contained . <p> The abrupt halt of commercial activity threatens to impose economic pain so profound and enduring in every region of the world at once that recovery could take years .

Jets will fill with families going on merely deferred vacations . Factories will resume , fulfilling saved up orders . <p> But even after the virus is tamed -- and no one really knows when that will be -- the world that emerges is likely to be choked with trouble , challenging the recovery . Mass joblessness exacts societal costs . Widespread bankruptcy could leave industry in a weakened state , depleted of investment and innovation . <p> Households may remain agitated and risk averse , making them prone to thrift .

" <p> Rising stock prices in the United States have in recent years propelled spending . Millions of people are now filing claims for unemployment benefits , while wealthier households are absorbing the reality of substantially diminished retirement savings . <p> Americans boosted their rates of savings significantly in the years after the Great Depression . Fear and tarnished credit limited reliance on borrowing . That could happen again . <p> " The loss of income on the labor front is tremendous , " Dumas said .

So long as some part of the world economy was growing , that supposedly moderated the effect of a downturn in any one country . <p> The global recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008 beggared that thesis .

" It 's incredibly worrying . " <p> Oxford Economics estimates that the global economy will contract marginally this year , before improving by June . But this view is likely to be revised down sharply , McFee said . <p> Trillions of dollars in credit and loan guarantees dispensed by central banks and governments in the United States and Europe have perhaps cushioned the most developed economies .

In this crisis , the authorities are demanding that people stay inside to limit the virus . <p> " The longer this goes on , the more likely it is that there will be destruction of productive capacity , " Owens Thomsen said .

China 's slowdown is rippling out to countries that supply Chinese factories with components , from Indonesia to South Korea . <p> Between now and the end of next year , developing countries are on the hook to repay some $2.7 trillion in debt , according to a report released Monday by the UN trade body .

It is also a marked departure from how we , as Indians , have responded to similar crises in the past . <p> Shedding our passivity , we have been decisive in taking precautionary measures .

By announcing partial closure followed by the rigorous implementation of the national lockdown , the Chief Minister has indeed become a role model for other States .

We must continue this spirit of camaraderie for the rest of the period of lockdown .

Until Covid-19 <p> JUST WHEN THE PHILIPPINES was finding its groove after decades in the economic wilderness , along came the Covid-19 pandemic . <p> During the past five years , growth averaged more than 6% and was projected to exceed 7% this year , vaulting ahead of long-time regional stars like China , Indonesia and India . More likely now is an expansion of just 3% in January to March , followed by a contraction the next two quarters , according to the central bank . Steep cuts to interest rates and purchases of government bonds wo n't alter that prognosis ; it 'll merely prevent the damage from being worse still . <p> Now the capital , one of the world 's most densely populated cities , is on lockdown to stem the surge of infections . The Philippines had at least 2,084 cases and 88 deaths as of Tuesday . Cargo is piling up unclaimed at Manila 's port and food is being held up at some checkpoints . The main island of Luzon , which is home to 60 million people and generates about 70% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rest of the archipelago and the world . <p> As sobering as these numbers are , the human drama behind them is even starker . More than 10 million Filipinos , or about 10% of the population , work abroad at any given time , cooking , cleaning , providing care , building things , and staffing commercial ships . Their remittances account for about 10% of GDP . From construction workers in Saudi Arabia to nannies in Italy and Singapore , this diaspora keeps an entire ecosystem afloat at home . Their wages help feed , clothe , educate , and put a roof over the heads of the grandparents and siblings who often raise their children . <p> That revenue stream is bound to take a hit this year ; the central bank reckons that remittance growth may be closer to 2% than the 3% previously projected . Leaving aside travel curbs at home , much of western Europe is shuttered and major airlines are mothballing fleets . In an effort to curb large scale gatherings , Singapore authorities have strenuously discouraged foreign workers -- many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucky Plaza on Orchard Road during their day off . The mall is home to a plethora of remittance services , a vital channel for getting cash back home given that almost half of foreign domestic workers lack bank accounts in the city-state . <p> Then consider call centers , another key pillar of the Philippines economy . Known as business process outsourcing , or BPO , the industry has surged in the past two decades to account for about 8% of GDP from almost nothing in 2000 . For many young people , who speak American-tinged English , these centers were a critical local alternative to life working overseas . When I visited one in mid-January -- RPV Native Commerce , which has since been renamed Scalewind Corp . -- its chirpy young employees said they felt lucky to be working in one of the world 's great back offices . <p> The sector 's success helps explain why President Rodrigo Duterte has granted exemptions for BPOs to keep running despite the broader lockdown .

@@71840441 <h> Coronavirus : A resilient supply chain is need of the hour <p> Amitabh Kant , Kowthamraj V.S Coronavirus has impacted millions and killed overthirty thousand people already across the globe since its emergence in Wuhan , China , in December last year . It has forced people to quarantine , socially distance themselves and compelled nations to lock down their populations . It will cause the biggest destruction to global economy ever witnessed , leading to a major slump in global GDP . In India , we arewitnessingthe lockdown of 18% of the world 's population for a three-week period . This has huge implications on the flow of goods and commodities for daily existence of citizens as well as ensuring supplies of essentials to confront the pandemic itself . In this atmosphere of uncertainty , the biggest risk faced by all nations is the potential breakdown of their healthcare system , resources and supply chain . Covid-19 's countries have witnessed a dramatic demand for medical supplies , test kits , respirators , masks , tubes , robes , thermometers , hazmat suitsand health workersprecisely at a time when the traditional global supply chainsare shutting down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its economy , South Korea analyzed what had gone wrong . There were n't enough test kits , which resulted in people with MERS shuttling from one hospital to another just to get a confirmation of their diagnosis . Also , nearly 83% of the transmission was due to just five ' super-spreaders ' -44% or nearly 81 of the 186 MERS-affected people had been exposed in nosocomial transmission at 16 hospitals . What if an elaborate testing regime had tested , contact-mapped and isolated those five people to contain the spread in time ? One of the reasons for lower testing frequency is the challenges in large-scale availability of testkits and allied medical supplies . Most virus-detecting kits are available only in big cities.The pandemic does not recognize geographical boundaries , race , ethnicity and economic status . Shoring up the healthcare system alone will not make any region resilient to future pandemics , some of which might even be more dangerous than Covid-19 . The world has to think differently ; it has to think better . The fact of the matter is that an excellent healthcare system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intensive care units and associated survival tools required in a pandemic will be enormously higher than normal . This underscores a need for an enormous supplychain ramp-up at short notice . The traditional healthcare supply chain , for the most part , comprises sets of highly specialized and relatively small factory units . Achieving scale is not a decision ; it is a skill . Scaling needs high-volume planning , credit , global infrastructure , social capitaland sophisticated deal-making . That is why even in China , the traditional healthcare supplychain was not enough to meet the demand of survival tools like masks . China 's BYD ( EV and battery maker ) appointed a task force comprising 3,000 engineers to build production lines at an existing plant in Shenzhenusing 90% of in-house components . They became the world 's largest mask-maker in a month . Most healthcare companies neither have those many engineers nor the production capacity and tooling in a single unit . Tata and Mahindra in India are now gearing up to produce crucial supplies like ventilators . Health workers take on a disproportionate share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India because it faces a severe shortage of doctors and nurses . In China and Italy , the fight against coronavirus has taken a huge toll on health workers . Protecting health workers who are in the forefront of the response is critical . The necessitates that we ensure personal protection kits-gloves , coverall , goggles , N-95 masks , shoe covers , face shield , triple-layer medical masks-and facilitate adequate food and resting facilities in hospitals . We greatly appreciate that the Government of India has provided Rs 50 lakh health insurance for all health personnel . We have faced five pandemics in the last 20 years ( one pandemic every five years ) . If countries have to become truly resilient to pandemics , it is imperative that they embrace the concept of ' dormant consortium ' . In essence , digital models of pandemics should be built and countries should put the best supply-chain experts of different industries in a room and request them to find out the synergies that even they did n't know existed to tackle the scenarios.Governments should identify companies ( auto , electronics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make certain categories of essential supplies at scale and club them together with specialized healthcare firms . A watertight , time-limited intellectual property agreement can be designed . An empowered representative from regulatory and standards ' agencies should be made part of the consortium . A big clothing company can not be made to wait for a long time to get necessary approvals for hazmat suit production . These multiple dormant consortium will come to life when the Government declares an imminent pandemic . Electronics and semiconductor manufacturers who have millions of workers trained to handle thousands of sophisticated cleanrooms ( which mandate full-body clean suits ) will have a huge role to play in pandemic-resilient supply chains . Since copper kills most microbes , pandemic-adaptive packaging can be sourced from copper foil suppliers to the battery industry .

@@71842041 <h> Ravanera : Not ' Survival of the Fittest ' but through cooperation <p> I WILL survive the onslaught of coronavirus because I am very strong . That is wrong . That dictum " Survival of the Fittest " is wrong ! There is now an evolving consciousness that Darwin 's theory of Survival of the Fittest is flawed and must be debunked , a wrong concept that has given way to a roadmap of paradigm that has justified the gross inequities and social injustices in a world where a few oligarchs are in control , that is , if " fittest " is equated to the strongest , the most aggressive who will defeat anyone who dare to challenge to dominate . That dictum only applies to a jungle-like existence like hungry wolves competing who is the one who will eat a cornered prey . <p> The " survival of the fittest " principle only survives in a highly competitive world . Certainly , the strongest wins . But competition only works in paradigm called the Neo-Liberal Capitalism concretized by globalization where the global corporations rule through exclusion of the poor and the oppressed . We must understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human societies . The scientist and philosopher Peter Kropotkin writes : " If we ask nature who are the fittest : those who are continuously at war with each other or those who support one another ? " We at once see that the animals which acquire habits of mutual aid are undoubtedly the fittest . They have more chances to survive and they attain , in their respective classes , the highest development of intelligence and bodily organization . " <p> That mindset of the strongest controlling everything has worked for the beasts in a world where the name of the game is survival . It should not be the case now where the name of the game should be sharing , cooperation and service . <p> It is horrible even to contemplate the present economic order in a world where only eight families have a total wealth equivalent to the total assets of more than 3.6 billion earthlings based on a study by Oxfam . I can only surmise that these billionaires with their tremendous financial rakings at the expense of the people and the environment are justifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fittest and they are the fittest who would crash down anyone in business . No sir ! Enough is enough of so much unbridled materialism and consumerism . That theory has reduced man who is an embodied spirit created by God in His image and likeness to being just a beast . That flawed theory has spawned a wrong development paradigm called Neo-Liberal Capitalism , a growth-at-all-cost development strategy that has sacrificed Mother Earth and the people to the altar of greed and profit . History tells us how man has become so dominating that wars have to be resorted every time threats to one 's domain loom . <p> There is no need to live in that jungle-like world anymore . The universe is unfolding so fast that there are so many things to do , to know , to discover and to explore . No need to prove who is the best but the only path is to cooperate , to work together , to be one so that humanity can journey to a higher level towards spirituality . Each one of us is a stream of consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards that Ocean of Consciousness called Love , called God ! <p> So the meaning now of the " fittest , " is the most cooperative , the most loving , the most service-oriented . Man has ceased to be Homo Sapiens as such is a failed specie who caused the deaths of more than 100 million of his kindred during the last one hundred years . That specie now has evolved to be Homo Pacem or Espiritus Luminus , men and women for peace and enlightened spirits as they are now connected to that Ocean of Love called God ! <p> Indeed , man is more spiritual than being a body so we must not " live by bread alone . " Even King Solomon in the Ecclesiastes said that power , wealth , titles -- these are meaningless , utterly meaningless . What is important is what is in our hearts and how we live to advance what is good , what is true and what is just . These are what really matter so that when we die , we will end up in God 's loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espiritus luminous , the new consciousness . <p> That new consciousness is now gaining headways in a materialistic world shifting towards spirituality as manifested by the growth of cooperativism that is founded on time-honored and universally-accepted cooperative principles and practices . There are now more than one billion cooperative members on earth who are exemplifying to the highest degree that biblical line , " serve the least of your brethren and you serve the Lord . " That is also clearly announced in the Holy Scripture and manifested in the song , to quote : " ... walang sinuman ang nabubuhay para sa sarili lamang , walang sinuman ang namamatay , para sa sarili lamang . Tayong lahat ay ginawa ng Panginoon , para sa isa't isa . " <p> The shift now is from self-aggrandizement to collective power . That talent given to you by God should not be used for self-aggrandizement but to serve one another to propel humanity to greater heights for God 's greater glory .

@@71842141 <h> Read Next <p> So here we are , perfecting our social distancing skills while schools , sports and other forms of social engagement are on indefinite hold , by a dangerous virus named after a ( regal ) crown . The coronavirus is named because the centre envelope is surrounded by small protein spikes called peplomers . These little protein spikes wreak havoc when they attach to lung tissue and hijack otherwise healthy tissue into building a potentially lethal coronavirus army of invaders . <p> Because the virus settles primarily with the respiratory tract -- the nose , mouth and lungs -- it is highly contagious when people sneeze , cough or exchange respiratory droplets with others . Despite its importance , social distancing has been a social disappointment for many weekend warriors , team sport athletes , fitness fanatics and sports fans who find camaraderie , biochemical joy from dopamine rushes or stress reduction through regular exercise and sport . <p> We areboth sports scientists who study athlete health and safety . We 're also proud exercise addicts who find the prospect of not exercising almost as disturbing as the prospect of the disease itself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the flu and some practical tips on how much people should ( and should not ) exercise . <p> Look for the ' just right ' amount <p> Both too much and too little are bad while somewhere in the middle is just right . Scientists commonly refer to this statistical phenomenon as a " J-shaped " curve . Research has shown exercise can influence the body 's immune system . Exercise immunity refers to both the systemic ( whole body cellular response ) and mucosal ( mucous lining of the respiratory tract ) response to an infectious agent , which follows this J-shaped curve . <p> A large study showed that mild to moderate exercise -- performed about three times a week -- reduced the risk of dying during the Hong Kong flu outbreak in 1998 . The Hong Kong study was performed on 24,656 Chinese adults who died during this outbreak . This study showed that people who did no exercise at all or too much exercise -- over five days of exercise per week -- were at greatest risk of dying compared with people who exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautiously suggest that exercise up to three days per week , two to three months prior , better prepares the immune system to fight a viral infection . <p> What if we have not exercised regularly ? Will restarting an exercise routine be good or bad ? Limited data , also obtained from mice , suggests that moderate exercise for 20 to 30 minutes a day after being infected with the influenza virus improves the chances of surviving . In fact , 82% of the mice who exercised 20-30 minutes a day during the incubation period , or the time between getting infected with flu and showing symptoms , survived . In contrast , only 43% of the sedentary mice and 30% of the mice who performed strenuous exercise -- or 2.5 hours of exercise a day -- survived . <p> Therefore , at least in laboratory mice , mild to moderate exercise may also be protective after we get infected with the flu virus , whereas a little exercise is good while no exercise -- or even too much exercise -- is bad . <p> For those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much during a flu pandemic ? It is clear that both too much exercise and exercising while sick increases the risk of medical complications and dying . <p> We conducted studies on both collegiate football players and cross-country runners , which showed a decrease in secretory immunoglobulin A , or " sIgA " when athletes competed and trained hard . SIgA is an antibody protein used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens , including viruses . <p> SIgA is also closely associated with upper respiratory tract infections ( URTI ) . When sIgA levels go down , URTI 's usually go up . We saw this relationship in football players , whereas the players showed the most URTI symptoms when their sIgA levels were lowest . This indirectly suggests that over-exercise without adequate recovery may make our body more vulnerable to attack , especially by respiratory viruses . So , when it comes to immunity , our studies show that more exercise is not necessarily better . <p> How much exercise may be just right ? <p> Here are some guidelines based on just the right amount -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise ( 20-45 minutes ) , up to three times per week . <p> Strive to maintain ( not gain ) strength or fitness during the quarantine period . <p> Do avoid physical contact during exercise , such as playing team sports , that is likely to expose you to mucosal fluids or hand-to-face contact . <p> Wash and disinfect equipment after use . <p> If you use a gym , find one that is adequately ventilated and exercise away from others to avoid droplets . <p> Remain engaged with teammates through social media , rather than social gatherings or contact .

Dated : 4/5/2020 12:21:49 AM <h> MARGINALIA <p> The chaotic conditions of Germany after the World War I became a catalyst for the rise of Hitler and his Nazi Party . The panic that was caused in 1933 by the incident of burning of the Reichstag building , enabled him to seize power . Panic , confusion and chaos are great crops for autocrats , as they enable them to seize power or consolidate control . These lessons from the rule book of the fascists are not forgotten as the world is caught in the grip of a global pandemic . While some regimes have dedicated themselves to fighting coronavirus , the authoritarian regimes are far busier using the pretext of the pandemic to exercise control . In Israel , the Netanyahu government has tightened its surveillance on the mobile phones of " suspected coronavirus patients and those close to them " . Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte threatened to shoot civilians who do n't adhere to the government 's strict lockdown orders amid the coronavirus pandemic , after protests erupted over food shortages . In USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border controls that he has long wanted to impose . Hungary 's right-wing prime minister who has capitalised on invoking the terror of immigrants has now brazenly spoken about a link between the migrants and coronavirus . India 's authoritarian regime is not to be left behind . Instead its juggernaut has been accelerated to the optimum level . It has used the coronavirus pandemic , the connected panic and the lockdown for bringing down a government in Madhya Pradesh , demonising women protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act , virtually creating a narrative that Covid-19 is a doing of the Muslims , disowning the poor and the migrant workers of the country , invoking a domicile law that militates against the popular aspirations of people of Jammu and Kashmir and starting a separate PM Care Fund for Coronavirus with no transparency or accountability mechanisms . The first coronavirus case in India was reported on January 30 and by February 3 there were three cases . All had originated from China . The transmission escalated in the beginning of March , after several cases were reported all over the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history to affected countries . On March 13 , the Delhi government forbade all gatherings of more than 200 people . On March 24 , the Indian government announced a complete country-wide lockdown for 21 days , setting a deadline of four hours and sending people , particularly the poor and the migrant workers into a tizzy . For three weeks before that when the positive Covid-19 cases began to escalate steadily , the government did not get its act together in terms of stock-piling medicines and protective gears for doctors , procuring test kits , even as India 's testing rate remains among the lowest in the world . While healthcare workers in India looking after Coronavirus patients have been facing a shortage of Personal Protective Equipments ( PPE ) , India did not stop its exports of protective equipment till March 20 , when the government banned export of surgical and disposable masks , all ventilators and textile raw material used for making masks . By then , global experiences of sudden exponential growth of Covid-19 had necessitated greater seriousness on part of the government . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown without enhancing testing rates which are imperative because many virus infected and carriers have been found to be asymptomatic and without ensuring adequate provisions of food , essentials and shelter for the poor . The reasons for this callousness are not difficult to locate . Politics has taken precedence over health concerns . The ruling BJP was more pre-occupied in rocking the Madhya Pradesh government , starting from March 9 and finally clinching the throne on March 23 . The lockdown came only a day later . After demonising the Shaheen Bagh women protestors and connecting them to Coronavirus terror , the BJP-government and its loyalist media has found a new enemy - Tableegh-i-Jamaat . Needless to point out that the religious organisation 's huge international congregation , which began on March 1 and lasted till March 15 , at a time when fears of coronavirus outbreak were becoming real was irresponsible . But the conference , many of whose participants have no tested positive , had all the clearances from the government . No efforts were made to stop it or screen the participants for Covid-19 even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than 200 people on March 13 . The right-wing hegemony , exercised through the amplifying voices of the lap-dog media , has served to create the dominant narrative of the culpability of Jamaat , even Muslims , in organizing large gatherings and endangering the lives of other people . It is a sign of the authoritarian powers using their might to give a spin to the story and singling out the Muslims as the villains . The truth is that pilgrimages to Tirupati , where thousands congregate , Vaishno Devi and many others were banned only few days before the lockdown . The Madhya Pradesh political drama that continued to descend on the roads for days and culminated in a grand swearing-in show on March 23 with leaders not just joining hands in a display of victory but also constantly hugging each other , besides BJP celebrations in many parts of the country . On March 22 , during the Janata Curfew by prime minister Narendra Modi , to his call for ' taali bajao ' , many Indians , in their moment of exuberance broke the curfew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched in processions . Pertinent also to point out that Uttar Pradesh chief minister , Adityanath , held an event , attended by VHP activists and priests , at Ayodhya a day after the lockdown.Almost eight months after Jammu and Kashmir special status was scrapped and its statehood robbed , the government brought in the contentious order laying down domicile rules at a time when there was no pressing emergency . Though the order was revised two days later , following some public criticism and opposition by some political groups including sections of BJP leaders in Jammu and Kashmir , it makes little difference the situation . Merely reserve all government jobs for J&amp;K 's domiciles , when the criteria for attaining domicile rights has been so relaxed is hardly a relief . The revised order also does not address the concerns with respect to land rights . Scrapping of Article 370 and Article 35A was a fait accompli . The domicile order simply adds clarity to what was lost on August 5 , 2019 . To issue the order at a time when people are caught in a lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vile ploy to ensure that the opposition and criticism to it remains muted . The political dramas apart , the authoritarian writ of the Indian government is also on display through the creation of a separate PM Care Fund , in the name of attracting micro and speedy donations , when a Prime Minister Relief Fund already exists and has similar provisions of attracting huge and quick donations . The transparency mechanisms of the PM Care Fund are not clear and the fund has been created as part of a trust with only three other trustees - home minister , defence minister and finance minister . Rest of the accountability has been stonewalled through press censorship , which now has the seal and approval of the Supreme Court .

If we continued at that pace for another 43 days , we 'd have 1,702,209 cases by 18 May . <p> What 's more , using the World Health Organization ( WHO ) ' s estimated fatality rate of 3.4% , more than 57,800 people would have succumbed to COVID-19 , the disease caused by the coronavirus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rate of growth has dropped off , substantially . <p> In fact , at one point only a few weeks ago the coronavirus case numbers were rising more than 25% daily , compared to low single-digit growth today . Does this mean that the restrictions put in place are working ? <h> How effective are these restrictions ? <p> This is , in large part , the result of government intervention , which has resulted in the unprecedented restrictions we are currently facing . <p> Below is a timeline of when those restrictions were put in place ( notably , this is not an exhaustive timetable -- many other restrictions , including state-specific restrictions , have also been put in place ) . <p> The chart also differentiates between new confirmed cases and new infections , assuming an incubation period of 6 days ( which is the incubation period for the median case ) . <p> As an example , while the Federal Government 's Stage 2 restrictions came into force on 24 March 2020 , we would assume that would have an immediate impact on new infections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing until 6 days later . <p> Data source : Worldometers , Chart : Author <p> This chart is by no means perfect . While I have assumed an incubation period of 6 days ( again , this is considered the median incubation period ) , the incubation period for coronavirus cases is currently estimated between 2 and 14 days . <p> But I think it does give a pretty good indication of the effectiveness of the restrictions themselves . <p> Blocking arrivals from Iran , South Korea , and Italy , for instance , likely went some way towards reducing imported coronavirus cases from certain ' coronavirus hotspots ' around the world , but others were still being imported undetected from countries like the United States . <p> The Stage 1 and Stage 2 restrictions enforced by the Federal Government , on the other hand , appear to have had a much more significant impact . These involved strict social distancing rules , and the closure of various venues such as gyms . <h> Coronavirus cases by state <p> The bulk of Australia 's coronavirus cases are located in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus cases has remained steady at approximately 45% between 16 March 2020 and 5 April 2020 , growing from 134 cases to 2,580 cases in that time . <p> Data Source : Australian Government , Chart : Author <p> Pleasingly , however , each of Australia 's states and territories are now taking more than 6 days to double their cases . The big outlier is Northern Territory , which is experiencing case growth of 86% every 6 days , although that is off a much smaller base ( it had just 26 recorded cases on Sunday 5 April , compared to 14 cases 6 days earlier ) . Victoria is experiencing the next highest rate of 6-day growth at 38% , followed by New South Wales at 35% . <p> The rate of daily growth , on the other hand , has slowed to low single digits . While that does not welcome complacency ( more on that in a moment ) , it is a very pleasing statistic . <p> Data Source : Australian Government , Table : Author <h> Testing for coronavirus <p> When we talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often overlooked is the number of tests being conducted . Without testing , a country could , theoretically , claim to have no official coronavirus cases . <p> Likewise , without testing the entire population regularly , there is no way of knowing exactly how many actual coronavirus cases there are . Hence , it is likely there are many , many more individuals who have coronavirus and are showing only very mild symptoms , or perhaps none at all , who are not included in the country 's official coronavirus cases . <p> In many ways , it is those individuals who we need to be most careful to avoid . Ironically , they are the ones who are more difficult to detect , hence the importance of the government 's strict social distancing rules ( that way , we avoid becoming infected from people who may not even know they are infected ) . <p> According to the Federal Government , 297,000 tests had been conducted by 5 April . That represents a testing rate of approximately 11.6 tests per 1,000 people in Australia , with 1 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That is a high rate of testing by international standards . According to Worldometers , the testing rate in Italy and Germany is roughly 10.9 tests per 1,000 people , while the United States has tested approximately 4.9 per 1,000 people . <p> As at 5 April 2020 , more than 56,000 tests had been conducted in Victoria , and 121,443 tests had been conducted in New South Wales . <p> On a per capita basis , South Australia and New South Wales appear to be doing the most testing ( 19.8 tests per 1,000 people , 16.6 tests per 1,000 people respectively ) . <p> Based on testing figures from the Federal Government , Victoria , Tasmania and Western Australia have conducted less than 10 tests per 1,000 population . <h> However ... <p> It is also important to note that Australia 's rate of testing has not been scaled up . In 3 of the past 4 days , between 6,000 and 7,000 tests have been conducted each day , compared to more than 10,000 daily tests which were being conducted each day late in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected each day recently may also be a function of lower testing . <p> Again , this suggests that the number of Australian coronavirus cases is likely much higher than the official number suggests . <h> No reason to become complacent <p> Indeed , there are many reasons to be positive about the declining growth in coronavirus cases , and also about Australia 's low fatality rate ( currently 0.6% ) . <p> But these positive outcomes have also raised certain doubts from some corners of the community . Namely , some people wonder : 1 ) whether the restrictions enforced by the federal and state governments were an overreaction ; and 2 ) whether things will go back to ' normal ' in the next few weeks . <p> In my opinion , the answer to both those questions is ' No ' . <p> To the first question , here 's an analogy . If you outlay for house insurance and , after 20 years , your house has n't burned down , was buying the insurance an overreaction ? <p> Without these restrictions , the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are experiencing now . In a recent interview , Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that without these measures , a further 5,000 Australians would have been infected with coronavirus . <p> By my numbers ( based on the growth in cases that Australia was experiencing ) , I would suggest that number would have been closer to an additional 10,000 . <p> At that stage , our hospitals would more than likely have already become overwhelmed , and our fatality rate would likely have been much higher ( due to many individuals not receiving the level of care required ) . <p> To the second question , growth in coronavirus cases is slowing . But as I alluded to above , there are likely still many cases that have gone undetected in the community . <p> The chart below , from the Australian Government , shows the source of COVID-19 transmission by state and territory . The light blue bars and the grey bars , which appear to add to around 600 -- 700 cases in aggregate , are either under investigation or locally acquired from an unknown source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Source : Australian Government . <p> Indeed , overseas acquired cases represented the bulk of Australia 's new cases in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak . Now that that source of infection has slowed dramatically ( due to travel bans ) , new cases appear to be mostly from within the community . <p> Hence , local transmission still represents a large threat , and could result in an increase in cases growth if individuals begin to become complacent . <p> The chart below shows a hypothetical scenario whereby all restrictions were removed today . It assumes a 3% rate of new case growth for 5 days , with growth then gradually increasing to 20% per day in 15 days . <p> Given the rates of growth experienced in recent weeks in Australia , and the rates of growth experienced internationally , that does not seem like an unreasonable expectation . <p> Chart : Author <p> The chart is shown on a logarithmic scale . Again , assuming all restrictions were relaxed , we could theoretically be adding more than 100,000 cases per day by 12 May . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too abruptly , is by no means in our best interests . <h> How is the share market holding up ? <p> The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index ( ASX : XJO ) soared last week , and has continued to recover ground this morning . At time of writing , the market has risen 127 points or 2.5% to 5,194 points . The Commonwealth Bank of Australia ( ASX : CBA ) share price is up 2.6% . <p> Personally , I feel the best way for investors to approach this market is with caution . Volatility levels have certainly declined , but that does n't mean there wo n't be more bad news , and that can certainly impact share prices . <p> Hence , perhaps the best way to buy into shares is by taking small nibbles , particularly in businesses you feel are well equipped to handle the current crisis . Strong balance sheets are a must in this climate , while those businesses that are able to continue operating mostly through remote work are ideal . <p> For instance , many cloud-based businesses such as Elmo Software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ASX : BTH ) have both adapted to remote work . <p> On the other hand , companies such as Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd ( ASX : FLT ) have been forced to make massive cost reductions and participate in heavily dilutive equity raises . With a highly uncertain outlook in the travel sector , I 'm certainly not investing in that space right now . <h> Foolish bottom line <p> A picture is worth a thousand words and whilst the charts above demonstrate that we are making progress in the fight against COVID-19 , the battle is not yet over . Scott Morrison has suggested that we get used to the idea of these heavy restrictions for 6 months . Despite the pleasing progress that has been made , you should n't expect those restrictions to be lifted any time soon . <p> This should also influence your investing perspective .

And brokerages and analysts can only agonize over when the sharp fall in stocks will stop . <p> The volatility seen in the last couple of months is expected to continue in April , and the heavy selling by foreign institutional investors and the over 42% weight of banks and financial companies in the benchmark Nifty 50 will keep any recovery in the index in check , analysts said . <p> Though governments and central bankers globally have taken stimulus measures , pouring in trillions of dollars to stem the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic , there is no clue as to how much this will help the economy , thereby making it so much more difficult to forecast and estimate GDP and corporate earnings . <p> In India , though the government has announced some relief measures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 basis points and taken steps to infuse 3.74 trln rupees into the banking system , worry over the health of the financial system remains . <p> Though these measures will reduce the impact of COVID-19 , the banking and financial sector can suffer as most of the loans to small and medium businesses can turn into non-performing assets , said J.K. Jain , managing director at brokerage Sampadha Advisors . <p> Even large corporate houses could go for restructuring of debt , which could further burden the banking and financial sector , added Jain . <p> The current COVID-19 tragedy playing out globally has led to continued exit of foreign investors from the emerging markets . In India alone , foreign portfolio investors sold close to $8 bln of stocks in March . <p> In contrast , domestic institutional investors bought just around $3.5 bln worth of shares in March . <p> Until now the COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 800,000 people and the number of deaths has risen around the world , as reported by CNN.com . The US alone has 185,000 cases , and the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser pace . <p> The last time the indices had crashed so drastically was during the global financial crisis when in the first eight months of 2008 , the Nifty 50 was down 28% . This was followed by a nearly 37% fall in the three months of Oct-Nov . <p> In Jan-Mar of 2020 , the impact of the coronavirus breakout has led the Nifty 50 to crash by over 29% to 8597.75 points as of Tuesday , and down 30.8% in just over 10 weeks from an all-time high of 12430.50 on Jan 20 . <p> It is difficult to give a range for the index as one ca n't predict the financial impact of the health crisis , and one ca n't be sure as to when the crisis will end , analysts at brokerages said . <p> Stocks are seen remaining volatile in April , with the Nifty 50 expected to move between 6700 and 10000 points on hopes that a solution is found to the crisis and the situation does n't deteriorate further , according to a poll of 28 brokerage houses . <p> Trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given that the country is in lockdown until Apr 14 , but volatility will continue as people are waiting for a solution to the pandemic , without which there will be negative global growth , said Jain . <p> Central bankers have cut interest rates and boosted liquidity , so the global economy could rebound once the pandemic ends . In the case of India , GDP for the Jan-Mar quarter is seen at 4% , but the following two quarters could see a decline , so corporate earnings could see growth only in the second half ( Oct-Mar ) of 2020-21 , said Jain . <p> A fall across assets and commodities is not all bad for India , as the sharp fall of over 61% so far in 2020 in global crude oil prices to a 17-year low will help cushion the country 's trade deficit and keep costs down to some extent for companies . <p> However , this is unlikely to lift the Nifty 50 in a hurry , and it could move in a range of 8000-9500 even if things do not go worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research at SPA Securities . <p> The Indian economy was already in a slowdown mode for the past several quarters and the current lockdown will accentuate the fall . But once the crisis ends , the stimulus given so far in terms of lower corporate tax rates and overall higher spending should boost the economy and help recovery in corporate earnings . <p> Any recovery in corporate earnings should more than compensate for the losses in the Apr-Jun period , added Avasthi . <p> Following are the support and resistance for the Nifty 50 for April obtained through a poll of 28 brokerages : <h> Other News <p> Friday , Apr 3 By Krishnadevan Vijayaraghavan The Securities and Exchange Board of India must now go one step ahead of its decision to bar company promoters and insiders from buying shares in their companies between Apr 1 and Jun 30 , thereby extending the norm on closure of trading windows for this category of individuals .

This article focuses on the disruption of economic activity on the villages of Alabujanahalli and Siresandara in Karnataka as a result of the lockdown declared on March 24 , based on telephonic interviews conducted on March 31 and April 1 . <p> Alabujanahalli is located in Mandya district of Karnataka and the major crops grown here are rice , sugarcane , finger millet , and sorghum . The kharif crop ( June to October ) of rice requires intensive irrigation , and large-scale farmers hire workers to undertake the transplantation and harvesting of rice in this period . Pre-kharif rice cultivation is usually done by small farmers with fewer irrigation facilities between February and May . This phase in the village is a lean period with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siresandara is in Kolar district . Here , farmers cultivate vegetables and finger millet between October and February . Vegetable cultivation is undertaken by large cultivators , while finger millet is grown by everyone in the village for home consumption . <p> In addition to agriculture , dairying and sericulture are important economic activities in both the villages and are primarily dependent on labour by women.In sericulture , the task of feeding leaves to worms and plucking cocoons from sericulture mountages are mostly carried out by women . Women are also responsible for most of the work related to livestock , including cleaning animal sheds , milking and depositing milk . <p> Since the lockdown on March 24 , farmers in Siresandara have been affected by disruption in transport services and in market procurement . Perishable horticultural crops can not be stored and there are no advanced post-harvest storage facilities in the village . This has led to the loss of a large quantity of cauliflowers , tomatoes , ridge gourds , and broad beans because of the farmers ' inability to take them to the market . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of February , and continued until the first week of March , after which farmers found it difficult to sell their produce . <p> Availability of labour is not a major constraint in Siresandara , as most are hired from within the village . " We are getting workers to harvest , but how will we pay them , if we can not sell our produce ? " asked respondent RC , who is a large-scale peasant in the village , and had cultivated tomatoes , ridge gourds , and broad beans on around eight acres of land . <p> Another respondent , SU , echoed similar worries , as he had to abandon two acres of his cauliflower crop because of inability to take the produce to the market . SU saideven if he had found a way to transport the produce to the first-stage market in Kolar town , he would not have been able to sell it because the prices had plunged , causing panic among large and medium farmers . <p> Both these respondents were unaware of the recent advisory from the Home Ministry exempting agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demand for the vegetables from neighbouring cities fell with the closure of canteens and restaurants . Transporting produce to markets in neighbouring states has also not been possible because of the lockdown . <p> In Alabujanahalli , sugarcane harvesting and transplantation of pre-kharif rice crop were underway when the lockdown was declared . Since the latter is done by local women workers , the work was completed without interruption . However , sugarcane cultivators had to face problems , as they enter into labour contracts with the factory to mitigate labour shortage , and the sugar factory in Mandya district sends migrant workers from Bellary on piece-rated contracts to harvest sugarcane . Around 60% of these migrant workers were sent back after being paid for the number of days they had worked . <p> The remaining 40%of the labour was accommodated in shelters in the village and the cultivators arranged for cooked food to be provided to them . The factory has been allowed to continue procuring produce until April 4 , 2020 , but it is unclear whether the sugarcane cultivators will be paid before the closure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements , if any , will be made for the remaining migrant workers . <p> Sericulture is also a significant part of the incomes and livelihoods of people in both these villages , and Karnataka is home to Asia 's second largest cocoon market ( Ramanagara ) . <p> " I had 300 kilograms of cocoons to be sold at the market , but with the lockdown , the markets for cocoons are suspended . I have offered to sell the cocoons at a lower price to households within the village , but everyone is afraid to start a new cycle given the situation " , said respondent SU from Siresandara . <p> A respondent from Alabujanahalli voiced similar concerns . " I could not sell my produce as the market is temporarily shut . I have sold some produce in an informal channel at Rs 150 per kg of the cocoon , the price of which otherwise would be Rs 500 per kg " . <p> The procurement of cocoons has ceased as exports have been temporarily suspended , which has adversely impacted those engaged in sericulture . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mitigate the crisis . <p> Dairying has also been negatively impacted . A factory worker at KOMUL ( Kolar-Chikkaballapura Cooperative Milk Producers ' Union Limited ) dairy said the milk factory was open only for pasteurising milk and preparation of curd . Other activities , such as the preparation of sweets , have ceased since the lockdown was announced . The factory is currently running with less than 50% of the workforce ; most of whom hail from nearby villages and have been paid for the month . There has been a decline in milk sales over the past couple of days because of the closure of street tea shops , restaurants and office canteens in nearby towns . <p> Although livestock owners in Siresandara continued to deposit milk at the procurement centre , there is fear that procurement might be suspended if there is a further decline in milk demand . Alabujanahalli is facing similar issues . As a respondent put it , " Money from dairying is a source of regular cash flow . Fortnightly payment by the dairy centre helps us sustain certain needs through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two days as demand has fallen . If that happens , we will suffer a major setback . " <p> The disruption in milk sales will particularly hurt small and medium peasants for whom dairying constitutes a significant share of income . Peasants have been using their already purchased stock of feed and fodder for their animals , but they are unsure of how they will replenish these . Poultry farmers have also suffered income losses from the abrupt decline in demand because of rumours that COVID-19 spreads from consumption of poultry and meat . <p> Landless Workers Worst Hit <p> Landless manual workers are among the worst affected by the lockdown . While peasants have some stocks of finger millet , landless workers have none , and the loss of employment they have faced in the past two weeks could seriously compromise their food security ( a few had sown finger millet on small patches of land in November and December last year ; this crop was harvested in February ) . <p> Women wage workers who are employed in the harvesting of crops and sericulture within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though they are willing to participate in field operations .

We do not have any money with us , " said YA , a 48-year-old woman who is a daily wage worker in Siresandara . Her husband VT , who is a tractor driver , added that he had been unemployed for the past 15 days . When asked about the free rations they are entitled to , they said that four kg of rice and one kg of arhar dal ( pigeon pea ) were distributed in the village on March 31 , 2020 . They were not aware of the quantity of rations that had been promised .

Wage workers in Alabujanahalli often find employment on construction sites . Some also contracted themselves out to sell coconuts on the Mysuru-Bengaluru highway . None of these opportunities has been accessible on account of the lockdown . <p> " Generally in this season , there are no agricultural operations . Rice transplanting got over in February . Until June , there would not be much work for us in the village . The men from the family go to towns to find some work in construction sites that also would not be workable in this situation . We have some grains to cook and eat , but the situation is extremely distressing " said one wage worker from Alabujanahalli . <p> Employment opportunities for hired workers have also fallen because , given their inability to pay hired workers . Peasants are relying on family labour , with women from peasant households harvesting vegetables themselves . <p> Little MGNREGA Work <p> In both the villages , there has been little work available under the MGNREGS ( Mahatma Gandhi National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers did get work last year , but days of work numbered fewer than 30 . Their dues were cleared between March 28 and March 31 , 2020 . The woes of the service industry have affected the livelihoods of a few in the village . Some young men in the village , who have worked as cab drivers , street vendors and plumbers , have not been paid what they were owed by aggregators/contractors . Most of them are unemployed and confined to their homes . <p> Some respondents were aware of some of the announcements made by the state government on television ; however , they were not confident about the implementation of the schemes announced . There were no mechanisms to ensure the immediate reach of free food grains to the beneficiaries . None of the households reported any information on the continuation of mid-day meals or the provision of grains instead of cooked meals . <p> Large farmers were aware of crop loan schemes , but were not informed about the implications of the current crisis on conditions of repayment and whether there would be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been assured were not yet credited to the accounts . <p> Women members of Self-Help Groups ( SHGs ) were aware of the possibility of deferring payments for three months .

The markets had strict rules in place , including timings for each village and social distancing protocols . The respondents felt that the impact of the disease was being felt more in cities , as they believed rural areas were insulated from infection . <p> There have been no instances of wage workers returning to these villages from other places . There is a functional ATM at a distance of 2-4 kilometres from both villages , but none of the villagers had stepped out to get money .

@@71850341 <p> The COVID-19 outbreak has shocked and deglobalised the international community of states . The World Health Organisation(WHO) has declared the outbreak as a pandemic , several scholars have argued that China has breached International Health Regulations(2005) ( IHR ) by not preventing the spread of the deadly COVID-19 , the IHR aims to aid the international community to prevent and respond to the acute public health risk that has the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide , the IHR works through its emergency committee and provides technical advice to the WHO Director-General in the context of a " public health emergency of international concern " ( PHEIC ) , PHEIC is defined as " an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to require a coordinated international response potentially " . The views of the world community are that China has not complied with the IHR regulations , scholar maintains that China violated Article 7 of IH concerning information-sharing during unexpected public health within its territories and Article 3 of IHR which categorically states that the IHR principles shall be respected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , this being the case one could argue that China breached human rights of its citizens by not respecting the IHR principles . The mechanism under Article 56 of IHR provides for arbitration as a means of settlement of a dispute with the consent of the disputed state , in this instance to obtain the consent of China is highly unlikely ; moreover , one of the pre-requisites for Article 56 to be put into operation is the existence of a ' dispute ' . <p> World Health Organisation and COVID-19 <p> States could invoke Article 21 and 22 of the WHO Constitution as a basis for establishing the jurisdiction of the ICJ . Article 21 provides the World Health Assembly ( WHA ) the power to establish regulations like IHR . I am of the view that the WHA and the subsequent regulation constitute the subsequent practice of the WHO Constitution ; hence the subject matter relates to the interpretation of the WHO Constitution . A State could in all probability bring multiple claims against China for violation of WHO Constitution ; firstly under Chapter XIV of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to submit a statistical report about the public health . Further , under Article 6 ( 2 ) of the IHR states " a State Party shall continue to communicate to WHO timely , accurate and sufficiently detailed public health information available to it on the notified event , where possible including case definitions , laboratory results , source and type of the risk , number of cases and deaths , conditions affecting the spread of the disease and the health measures employed ; and report , when necessary , the difficulties faced and support needed in responding to the potential public health emergency of international concern . " Similarly , Article 7 of the IHR provides for ; information sharing , therefore any state will be drag China to the ICJ could claim the breach of Article 6 and 7 of the IHR regulation . <p> Moreover , one of the salient rules of treaty interpretation is the principle of Good Faith as codified under Article 31 of Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties , with respect to the performance of the treaty mandate ; China was in blatant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 7 of the IHR being violated , States could also forward claims for the breach of Article 37 by not respecting the International character of WHO secretary-general by providing inaccurate data on COVID-19 . Notwithstanding the potential for multiple claims against China , one has ascertained the Jurisdictional compatibility of these claims . <p> Jurisdictional Compatibility in the ICJ vis- ? -vis Covid-19 <p> The basis for the jurisdiction of the ICJ is Article 75 of the WHO Constitution , which states " Any question or dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this Constitution which is not settled by negotiation or by the Health Assembly shall be referred to the International Court of Justice in conformity with the Statute of the Court unless the parties concerned agree on another mode of settlement . " <p> The State intending to drag China to the ICJ has to satisfy the criterion of negotiation to invoke the jurisdiction of the ICJ , in the Jadhav case the ICJ when interpreting the optional protocol to Vienna convention on consular relation noted that the recourse to arbitration is not a prerequisite before approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICJ would exempt the negotiation criterion in Article 75 of WHO Constitution . The fundamental problem that States would encounter while pulling China to the ICJ is a ) Establishment of a dispute , under Article 36(2) of the ICJ Statute , the function of the ICJ is only to decide international law disputes that states submit , popularly called ' non ultra petita rule ' . Also , according to Article 36 , paragraph 2 , of the ICJ Statute , the ICJ 's jurisdiction extends to all " legal disputes " that may arise between States Parties to the Statute having made a declaration under that provision . The existence of a dispute between the Parties is thus a condition of the Court 's jurisdiction , and the burden of proving the existence of the dispute falls on the applicant ( Border and Transborder Armed Actions ( Nicaragua v. Honduras ) , Jurisdiction and Admissibility , Judgment , I.C.J. Reports 1988 , p. 75 , para . 16 ) ; therefore any state contemplating to bring a claim against China has to establish the existence of a dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of the dispute , in the Marshall Island case , the ICJ rejected the argument of Marshall Island by a vote of nine to seven on this precise question . Only if the issue of ' dispute ' is settled the ICJ can proceed to the merit phrase . <p> Advisory Opinion -- The Way Forward <p> The jurisdictional hurdles in the ICJ concerning the contentious cases could prompt the WHO to request an advisory opinion to the ICJ , Article 76 of the WHO constitution provides " Upon authorization by the General Assembly of the United Nations or upon authorization by any agreement between the Organization and the United Nations , the Organization may request the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on any legal question arising within the competence of the Organization . " The sole criterion to be fulfilled for requesting an advisory opinion is that request should be a legal question within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ . In 1993 , the WHO requested the ICJ to provide an advisory opinion on the use of nuclear weapons by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its obligations under international law including the WHO Constitution . The ICJ concluded that the responsibilities of the WHO was necessarily restricted to the sphere of " public health " and therefore could not encroach on the responsibilities of other parts of the United Nations system . Since the present COVID-19 pandemic primarily falls under the ambit of " public health " , the WHO is competent to request an advisory opinion as it falls within its mandate . The advantages of requesting an advisory opinion are manifold , firstly , till date , the ICJ has rendered 27 advisory opinions , albeit advisory opinions are not binding on the States , it lays down a path to the organs of the United Nations for the subsequent course of action , in the instant case ; it can assist the General Assembly to pass resolutions condemning passivity of China concerning controlling the spread of the pandemic . Secondly , in the landmark advisory opinion " Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory , 2004 " , the ICJ observed that victims be provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ICJ to compensate for the loss . Thirdly , the advisory opinion does not require the consent of states ; this can offer scope for judicial activism and transcend the passivity that is associated with contentious cases . Fourthly , in an advisory opinion every state is provided with an opportunity to submit relevant evidence and facts , the court gets to decide on the basis all the available data at its disposal thus ensuring evidentiary propriety . <p> Conclusion <p> The present crisis can allure the states to approach the ICJ against China ; however , the probability of success is very slim because the ' question of dispute ' as pointed above would be difficult to establish . Secondly , assuming that the ICJ decides on the merits , the enforcement happens at the Security Council , China as a permanent member of the UN could veto the enforcement of the judgment as previously witnessed in the ICJ . Therefore it will be a safe bet to place the ball in the court of the general assembly for further course of action through an advisory opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advisory opinion on such a massive issue could set a right precedent by regulating the conduct of states and participate proactively in the functioning of the United Nations fruitfully . <p> Views Are Personal Only . <p> ( Author is Assistant Professor of Law at The WB National University of Juridical Sciences )

Amid the coronavirus pandemic , they 've done the mental gymnastics to somehow link the two in order to keep their misinformation topical . The result is quite dangerous . <p> Their theory rests on two pillars : that the coronavirus epicenters are places with 5G networks , and that 5G radio waves are at a higher frequency than previous phone networks . It 's not clear how these prove any link between the two things , other than somehow , mysteriously , 5G is responsible for the virus . <p> While many who perpetuate the myth think they 're exposing a huge coverup , they 're actually just causing unnecessary panic . Tim Minchin put it best : " You 're not a maverick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <h> What exactly is 5G ? <p> 5G is the latest generation of mobile network technology , just like how 4G came after 3G .

There is also no evidence for any other supposed health effects such as immune suppression , either . <p> The shorter wavelength means the signals have a shorter range , and they also have trouble travelling through buildings . In cities , this means far more mobile phone towers need to be built in order for 5G coverage to supersede 4G coverage . <h> How does 5G relate to the coronavirus pandemic ? <p> It does n't , but some people argue otherwise . <p> One claim in particular is being used by 5G truthers to hook new converts to the conspiracy theory .

This research is incoherent and not peer-reviewed . It links a bunch of desperate claims , themselves unreliable , with no real evidence . Because the 5G movement has been around since long before the coronavirus pandemic , conspiracy theorists have a huge stash of made-up research to draw from . <p> Some people are spreading maps overlaying 5G towers with large virus clusters .

India is still at the receiving end in terms of FII outflows . They continue to sell when global markets are looking better , things are stabilising , the virus spread has not been alarmingly high in India , the lockdown at least initially seems to be working , crude prices have got crushed . But foreign investors continue to throw in the towel , dump and sell and throw names like HDFC , HDFC Bank . Why is that ? Three simple reasons . To begin with , India was coming out of a weak growth backdrop and investors were worried how India 's fiscal and monetary policymakers will handle this new challenge and the policy announcement also took time to come through . Secondly , India 's selling has also been reflective of a broadbased passive selling ; probably it is not necessarily active selling , though we have seen that also . Passive selling does not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lastly , while India has had fewer cases , markets are also seeming to worry that the risk of a bigger spread in India still remains , because the testing infrastructure has not been ramped up well . So that worry is still lingering on the minds of investors . There is still risk out there , compared with other markets , where we have seen a lot of testing being done already . Investors can have some sense of when this is peaking out . These are the things we are hearing from investors . We may not agree with them but this is what we are hearing from investors . <p> How does one judge the market right now , because on one side you have got DII buying while on the other side you have got FII selling . I am talking about the near-term predictability of the market . Do you think one should not really bother about what is going to happen over the next three months or should one resign and accept the fact that India will be extremely vulnerable to FII flows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows will clearly matter . We have seen in the last couple of months that despite domestic buying , the market has corrected . Also , domestic investors might soon be running out of ammunition to keep buying as the market corrects or if the market corrects . So the dependence of the markets on foreign flows is much higher today than it was a month-and-a-half or two months back . The second thing is , we also like to draw parallels from say the GFC period , while FII selling in dollar terms was higher , in percentage terms , in market cap terms , it has been lower . If I look at DIIs , local mutual fund buying is better relatively now compared with that time , when it was much more sporadic . So this dynamic is also relevant in the context that India 's valuations despite the sharp correction have not reached GFC levels if we look at the trailing multiples , which are a fairer way of looking at the market right now . So keep that mind . <p> How do we look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our earnings framework , multiples framework , our base case for Nifty is 10,000 for March , 2021 , and downside case is 6,000 and upside case 11,600 . So the risk-reward may appear attractive here at these levels , but the big presumption here is how coronavirus pans out in India and globally , and that is something which we must remember . <p> It is very difficult for any of us to model that in as we are not medical or healthcare experts . The big difference for this market cycle versus any of the past cycles is that what we have seen is not a classical market or economic cycle ; it is linked to what is happening around coronavirus . <p> Are you saying you are making a case that Nifty in a bear case scenario could slip to 6,000 level also ? Yes . Our downside case is 6,000 , our base case is 10,000 by March 2021 and our upside case is 11,600 . If you look at these three scenarios , the risk-reward from the current levels does appear attractive . But yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely ignore the downside scenario when you are taking investment calls . <p> In the near term , do you believe a lot more clarity will come next week once we know what is happening with the lockdown in India , whether the government chooses to extend it , whether it gets lifted ? Will that sort of arrest a lot of concerns at least in the near term in the market ? Absolutely , that will help . Even this week , we will get more clarity about the big concern as to where India is seeing local transmission versus community transmission . So even this week 's numbers will matter and obviously when the lockdown gets lifted and the actions taken after that will matter . <p> In the meantime , what is the strategy ? Do you try and make that core portfolio assuming Nifty goes to 6,000 ? I hope not . Or on the way down if do try and time the market , do you just go by those core portfolio names that you want to buy ? If they are already in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is always tough to time the market even in the best of times . In that context , today 's times are possibly the most uncertain times because it is not just market and economic cycle , it is also about what is happening around coronavirus . But we look at it beyond the valuation metric , even on trailing earnings basis , and look at balance sheets whether they can sustain any further deterioration or continue to deteriorate . What is also worth thinking about are the inherent businesses , how sustainable they are beyond the disruption from coronavirus in the sense that whatever destruction we are seeing today is it plain and simple postponement of demand and , therefore , whether the demand can come back fairly strongly ? Or if the business models are relevant or cases where it can hurt now or it will take much longer to come back . <p> So you look at multiple levels and screen for sectors and stocks . That is how we come up with various scenarios for investors . There will be pockets which have worked well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in our view , are offering attractive value today , especially the top end of the financial services sector , private banks with retail liability franchise , etc . Then there are a lot of deep value utility in oil and gas stocks , where we do not see any risk to inherent business models and they are attractive at these level . Then , telecom is an obvious one . And then it becomes much more stock specific rather than big picture-specific calls . <p> While a breakthrough on the medical front of course could potentially lead the recovery , do you think we could see some amount of economic and business normalisation by Q3 or is it still a very long way off given the talks about the kind of ballooning recession that we could witness ? It all depends on how prolonged the disruption is , and how much damage the disruption causes to jobs . Because the more jobs are lost in the interim , the slower the recovery period will be . It takes time for businesses to hire and ramp up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical impact , but also psychologically , because it takes time for businesses to come back . The simple answer is if the lockdown lifts in a couple of weeks from now , and things start normalizing in terms of coronavirus data points , then yes Q3 will definitely have a good recovery . If the lockdown is not lifted completely but there is some mix and match here and there or the impact of coronavirus in terms of cases , deaths is prolonged , then it will be a much more gradual recovery . So , the pace and scale of disruption will matter in terms of pace and scale of recovery . <p> We have seen some economic relief measures from RBI , but naturally in trouble times such as this , corporate India as well as all of market participants are in need of more measures . Do you think that a huge fiscal stimulus is the need of the hour on top of the recently-announced measures by the RBI ? What more do you think needs to be done ? Absolutely . If you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GDP fiscal stimulus . And today as we speak , even if you combine the stimulus announced by the states , it is roughly 1 per cent or 1.1 per cent of GDP . Obviously as the fiscal space is much smaller today compared with what it was in 2008 , that could put things in perspective beyond what other global markets or economies are doing . <p> Clearly given the disruption , yes there is scope and expectation among investors that there will be more fiscal stimulus coming . There have been reports about what further relaxations or the government will do for SMEs . So it is quite likely that more fiscal stimulus will come . Whether they will replicate the GFC is anyone 's guess . It all depends on the scale and timing of the entire disruption . If this continues for three more months , then obviously we are looking for much bigger fiscal stimulus . If post lockdown things normalise , then we will have possibly one more round but not necessarily similar to the 2008 levels .

In an exclusive interview with Zee Business , Dinesh said that the coronavirus outbreak has led to an immediate requirement of laptops and Asus is trying to find ways to help with that . <p> " The biggest disruption caused by coronavirus is that now everybody wants laptops . We are working on how to serve this demand . For example , in case there is an emergency and a bank wants laptops , we are looking at options to help in that regard , " he said . <p> Dinesh said that the basic necessities have changed and now , in modern times , include Roti , Kapda and Mobile .

Because of this the input cost has increased . Even though we are making products in India , the components are supplied from outside in US dollars . This can impact the price of products in future , " he added . <p> Another blow for smartphone companies came in the form on GST hike .

@@71866341 <h> April 2020 : Biggest Test of Indian Healthcare Resilience <p> By Professor Ujjwal K Chowdhury . Dated : 4/14/2020 1:15:33 AM <p> Two Extreme Opinions on India 's Date with COVID 19:There are several reports on what are the likely scenarios of Coronavirus attack in India . Some are predicting an unprecedented catastrophe where it " will just rip through the population " and explaining through advanced modelling how it can directly affect 30 million people or more . And at the other end are the laudatory references to the government being successful in executing a total lockdown in the nation , and could contain the virus to barely a few thousand cases . This second school of Pundits believe that the virus can not survive in the high temperature Indian summer that has sat in and among Indians with a younger demographics and high immunity . Figures of SARS and Ebola or Nipha virus attacks globally versus India are quoted to show how India is comparatively safer . Current figure of less than 9000 cases of Corona positive seems to point towards that.We all know India is a country of more than a billion people ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cities , such as Mumbai and Kolkata , are extraordinarily dense . Since people who live in India often travel between different states for work , the lockdown also left millions of migrant workers stranded ; many of whom returned home on foot crossing hundreds of miles . Hence , all know that a major outbreak in a country with huge public-health deficiencies is likely to have devastating , far-reaching consequences.India 's Predicament Now:To try to understand India 's predicament , we need to first note that the virus struck China first ( followed immediately by Japan and South Korea , and all these nations seem to have got a grip over the situation now ) , after a month it struck Italy and several European nations ( where situation has worsened a lot , but of late the flattening of the curve has started ) , thereafter Iran , US and UK and others ( where situation is now grave with a rising curve ) , then Middle East and South Asia ( where the worst situation possible is yet to come in India , Pakistan , UAE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started since early March ( and we are at least a week late to bring in lockdown ) and that of concern for India is now over the next two to four weeks . First 1000 cases happened in 8 weeks , second one in 4 days , the third one in 3 days , and the fourth 1000 in two days , and thereafter a thousand new patients every day . Like in these other countries , it probably happened in India because of airline traffic-but not because of people coming from China , all of whom were quarantined very early , but likely because of Italians who had carried the virus , who were tourists here . And a number of the early cases actually involved Italians . So it arrived after it had fully seeded in Italy , and the testing was pretty small at the beginning . What we expect is that this is probably because of testing not being adequate , similar to what happened in the early stage of the epidemic in the United States , as well , where it suddenly catches fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes off . In India , it is not clear where it will catch up this way if at all , though the Tablighi Jamaat congregation has emerged to be one major source . There is no evidence that the temperature and the humidity are slowing down the virus.Health Infrastructure as a Challenge:And we 've got a lot of compounding problems , which are that the health-system capacity is generally weak across the country . The number of hospital beds one bed for every 2000 people is remarkably low . It 's probably a fifth of what the U.K. has , for instance . And it 's also got a population that has tuberculosis and respiratory issues and pneumonia and high rates of smoking and air pollution . So , the trajectory of the disease in this population is going to be unclear . It is to be noted here that already 63 doctors and nurses have tested positive even at this early stage of the spread of the disease in India . Also about a third of the country 's adults are hypertensive , and about one-tenth of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to compound the problem . Thankfully the Indian Council for Medical Research ( ICMR ) has ordered for large scale testing of symptomatic patients which till now has been only 30 tests for every million people.Surely some communities have got the disease and transmission has started . We 've already seen cases in the slums of Mumbai , as you know , are some of the biggest slums in the world , with millions of people living next to each other . Then the Tablighi Jamaat congregation of some 4000 people in the narrow confines of Nizamuddin in the second half of March has led to the largest spike of cases spreading to Delhi , Tamil Nadu , Telengana etc . The mass exodus of migrant labourers from Delhi-NCR mainly to UP-Bihar , the huge congregation of devotees in Tirupati and Ayodhya recently and the mass celebrations at the end of March 22 Janata Curfew are yet to be seen over the next two weeks if they were potential carriers of the disease . The virus has been seen earlier to appear where it sort of stays quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in symptomatic cases , typically the elderly . India 's population above the age of sixty-five is much smaller than that of Italy and certainly of China as well . That 's something which has a bit of a protective effect . Lockdown Revisited:The government 's shutdown order , at one level , seems sensible , though might have been a week delayed . At another level , it appears akin to a lot of what this government does , like demonetization : implemented hurriedly without notice like of two days in Australia and New Zealand or three days in Singapore , without a ton of thought about how it was going to be put into effect . The horrific human cost of this lockdown , even if it 's necessary , is already quite high . We have no idea about the rural distress , what 's happening out there . We have not seen the end of this lockdown story . Flitch says 2% of GDP growth will go down in next quarter and a business daily says 7 million jobs in organized sector will go to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proactively to prevent death is not very popular , because the public will never give credit for deaths they averted . The public will only blame them for the damage they caused . So , from that perspective , the government has been decisive on lockdown , however ill prepared one , and completely ill prepared for the economic recession setting in.The Rural Challenge:India has a really weak surveillance system for reporting diseases . So we wo n't actually get to observe rural deaths or rural cases , because if someone who is poor in a village is dying of respiratory distress it wo n't record . Only around a fifth of India 's deaths are actually certified and recorded . The health indicators differ vastly across India , largely due to the action-inaction of the state governments . For example , while Kerala has admirable health indicators , some parts of Bihar has indicators as bad as sub Saharan Africa . Then , the other part is that we do n't actually know what 's going to happen to them in terms of immediate issues which relate to hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its entire population , just from a public stock . But it 's not clear that the food is getting to those places , or that it can in such a short period of time.And , with the entire health system geared toward COVID-19 response , as it correctly should , we may also see some of the other things ( TB , malaria , etc ) get out of control , as happened in West Africa during Ebola , for instance . Even in other countries which are facing these kinds of pandemics , we see the rest of the health services take a hit for a while . A large part of the country is really in the informal economy . So they depend on agriculture . The production side is impacted in places where farmers are affected by the lockdown , and they are unable to sell their crops . Additionally , there is going to be a crush of migrants , who were previously working in cities and sending money back to villages , who are now out of work and back in villages themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will certainly take a hit in terms of health &amp; farm economy . Possible Way Out:Massive build-up of health-infrastructure is the immediate need along with large number of focused affected community-specific testing of Corornavirus . India has only tested around 130 people in every million , decidedly the least in the world , and lower than 258 of Pakistan . Protective gears for healthcare workers , half of a million ventilators , millions of masks and gloves , large quantum of necessary drugs , etc are needed . Next , India needs full insurance and travel protection for all government and private healthcare , sanitary , banking sector , essentials supplies etc.Complete deferment of all EMIs , rent and personal direct taxes for a minimum of three months and a maximum of six months to help people cross the hurdle . The 18 crores of Jandhan Accounts including PM Kisan beneficiaries must get support of Rs.5000 a month for three months minimum , apart from MNREGA workers getting three months payment upfront . Old age pensioners must get three months of pension upfront in their accounts.For all these and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its 2.7 trillion dollar economy , which amounts to around 9 lacs crores , whereas the government of India has so far allotted Rs.1.7 lac crores . This is abysmally low in front of 18% of GDP being given for Combat COVID mission in Germany , 14% in UK , 8% in USA and 4% in China . Hope we learn the lessons and before it is too late . April 2020 is a make or break month for India and it must act now . * ( The author is a media academic , columnist and television panellist , and is currently the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Kolkata based Adamas University . )

According to the study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research , there is no evidence or research to claim that these bat coronaviruses can cause disease in humans , said Dr Pragya D Yadav , Scientist at the National Institute of Virology ( NIV ) , Pune and also the first author of study . Twenty-five bats of Rousettus and Pteropus species from Kerala , Himachal Pradesh , Puducherry and Tamil Nadu were found positive for BtCoV in Kerala , Himachal Pradesh , Puducherry and Tamil Nadu .

" Bats are considered to be the natural reservoir for many viruses , of which some are potential human pathogens . In India , an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past . It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) also has its association with bats , " the objective of the study titled ' Detection of coronaviruses in Pteropus and Rousettus species of bats from different states of India ' stated . " In the present scenario of changing demography and ecological manipulations , it is challenging to have checks on the encounters of bats with other animals and humans , " the study stated , highlighting that the need for active and continuous surveillance remains crucial for outbreak alerts for bat-associated viral agents with epidemic potential , which would be helpful in timely interventions .

It is still not understood as to why only certain CoVs can infect people , " the study said . The scientists stressed on the need of proactive surveillance of zoonotic infections in bats . The detection and identification of such viruses from bats also recommends cross-sectional antibody surveys ( human and domestic animals ) in localities where the viruses have been detected . Similarly , if the epidemiological situation demands , evidence-based surveillance should also be conducted , the study said while emphasing on the need of developing strong mechanisms for working jointly with various stakeholders such as wildlife , poultry , animal husbandry and human health departments . " In conclusion , our study showed detection of bat CoVs in two species of Indian bats .

Sardhana distributors at Basvanagudi asked me to get it authenticated at Regional Office in Unity buildings and a manager there by the name of Maqqi refused to do so and abused me verbally for troubling him ! <p> The coronavirus COVID-19 is spreading relentlessly through the world creating a trail of death and destruction . The world is in danger of falling into a Great Depression , with millions of workers being rendered unemployed across the globe . The impact will especially hit the poor -- both in terms of health and economics ; many can not even afford to wash their hands because of the lack of water . What will happen to the millions who can not practice social distancing ? The slum-dwellers , the prison population and the refugees huddled in tents ? <p> Businesses are closing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distancing , and vigorously wash their hands . People are stocking up on all kinds of food and sundries that are part of daily living . Some are hoarding masks , toilet paper and other necessities , should COVID-19 linger on for weeks , months , or years . <p> While the US has just passed a 2 trillion dollar aid package , the details seem to once again point to socialism for Wall Street , in the form of bailouts , a small pay-cheque for the working poor , and little else for Main Street . Income inequality is poised to increase yet further . <p> I predict that this period of deprivation and anxiety will usher in new consumer attitudes and behaviours that will change the nature of today 's capitalism . Finally , citizens will re-examine what they consume , how much they consume , and how all this is influenced by class issues and inequality . Citizens need to re-examine our capitalist assumptions and emerge from this terrible period with a new , more equitable form of capitalism . <p> Capitalism 's Dependence on Endless Consuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the emergence of the Industrial Revolution . <p> The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century greatly increased the number of goods and services available to the world 's population . The steam engine , railroads , new machinery and factories , and improved agriculture greatly increased the economy 's productive capacity . More production inevitably leads to more consumption , which in turn leads to more investment . More investment increases production in an ever expanding world of goods . <p> Citizens delighted in the availability of more goods and choices . They could individualize their personalities through their choices of food , clothing and shelter . They could shop endlessly and marvel at the innovative offerings of the producers . <p> Citizens increasingly turned into consumers . Consuming became a lifestyle and culture . Producers profited greatly from the increasing number of active consumers . Producers were eager to stimulate more demand and more consumption . They turned to print advertising and sales calls , and as new media arose , they turned to telemarketing , radio marketing , TV marketing , and Internet marketing . Business firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer desire and purchasing . <p> From the beginning , some onlookers had misgivings about the rise of consumerism . Many religious leaders saw the growing interest of citizens in material goods as competing with religious attention and spiritual values . The legacy of puritanical values kept certain population groups from acquiring too many goods and getting into too much debt . Some citizens were particularly critical of wealthy consumers who used goods to flaunt their wealth . The economist Thorsten Veblen was the first to write about " conspicuous consumption " that he saw as a malady taking people away from more meditative lifestyles . In The Theory of the Leisure Class , Veblen exposed this sickness of status display . Had he lived long enough , he would have been aghast at the news that the former first lady of the Philippines , Imelda Marcos , owned 3,000 pairs of shoes that languished in storage since her exile from the Philippines . <p> The Growing Number of Anti-consumerists <p> There are signs today of a growing anti-consuming movement . We can distinguish at least five types of anti-consumerists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life simplifiers , persons who want to eat less and buy less . They are reacting to the clutter of ' stuff ' . They want to downsize their possessions , many of which lie around unused and unnecessary . Some life-simplifiers are less interested in owning goods such as cars or even homes ; they prefer renting to buying and owning . <p> The second group consists of de-growth activists who feel that too much time and effort are going into consuming . This feeling is captured in William Wordsworth 's poem , <p> " The world is too much with us ... <p> Getting and spending , we lay waste our powers : <p> Little we see in Nature that is ours ; <p> We have given our hearts away , a sordid boon ! " <p> De-growth activists worry that consumption will outpace the carrying capacity of the Earth . In 1970 , the world population was 3.7 billion . By 2011 , the world population grew to 7.0 billion . Today ( 2020 ) , the world population stands at 7.7 billion . The U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2050 . The nightmare would be that the Earth can not feed so many people . The amount of arable land is limited and the top soil is getting poorer . Several parts of our oceans are dead zones with no living marine life . De-growth activists call for conservation and reducing our material needs . They worry about the people in the emerging poor nations aspiring to achieve the same standard of living found in advanced countries , something that is not possible . They see greedy producers doing their best to create ' false and unsustainable needs . ' <p> The third group consists of climate activists who worry about the harm and risk that high buying consumers are doing to our planet through generating so much carbon footprints that pollute our air and water . Climate activists carry a strong respect for nature and science and have genuine concerns about the future of our planet . <p> Fourth , there are sane food choosers who have turned into vegetarians and vegans . They are upset with how we kill animals to get our food . Everyone could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit diet . Livestock managers fatten up their cows and chickens to grow fast , and then kill them to sell animal parts in the pursuit of profits . Meanwhile , cows are a major emitter of methane that heats our earth and leads to higher temperatures , faster glacial melting , and flooding of cities . To produce one kilogram of beef , requires between 15,000 and 20,000 liters of water as well as so much roughage to feed the animals . <p> Fifth , we hear about conservation activists who plead not to destroy existing goods but to reuse , repair , redecorate them or give them to needy people . Conservationists want companies to develop better and fewer goods that last longer . They criticize a company such as Zara that produces a new set of women 's clothing styles every two weeks that would only be available only for two weeks . Conservationists oppose any acts of planned obsolescence . They are hostile to the luxury goods industry . Many are environmentalists and anti-globalists . <p> The anti-consumerism movement has produced a growing literature . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , This Changes Everything , and The Shock Doctrine . Also see the documentary film The Corporation by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott . <p> How Businesses Sustain the Consumer Sentiment <p> Business firms have an intrinsic interest in endlessly expanding consumption for the purpose of higher profits . They rely on three disciplines to boost consumption and brand preference . The first is innovation to produce attractive new products and brands to enchant customer interest and purchase . The second is marketing that supplies the tools to reach consumers and motivate and facilitate their purchasing . The third discipline is credit to enable people to buy more than they could normally buy on their low incomes . Businesses aim to make consumption our way of life . To keep their productive equipment and factories going , they must ritualize some consumer behaviour . Holidays like Halloween , Christmas , Easter , Mother 's Day , and Father 's Day are partly promoted to stimulate more purchasing . Businesses want not only purchase of their goods but fast consumption so that objects burn up , wear out , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a hyper-real world of must-have products that claim to deliver happiness and well-being . Businesses refashion commodities into compelling brands that can bring meaning into the consumer 's life . One 's brand choices send a signal of who the person is and what he or she values . Brands bring strangers together to share carefully designed images and meanings . <p> How Will Anti-consumerism Change Capitalism <p> Capitalism is an economic system devoted to continuous and unending growth . It makes two assumptions : ( 1 ) people have an unlimited appetite for more and more goods and ( 2 ) the Earth has unlimited resources to support unlimited growth . Both of these are now questioned . First , many people become jaded and satiated by the effort to continuously consume more goods . Second , the earth 's resources are finite , not infinite , and could not meet the needs of a growing world population that comes with growing material needs . <p> Until now , most countries have used only one measure to assess the performance of their economy . That measure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total value of the goods and services produced in a given year by the country 's economy . What it does n't measure is whether GDP growth has been accompanied by a growth in people 's well-being or happiness . <p> We can imagine a case where GDP grows by 2 or 3 percent by workers working very hard and even at overtime . They only have two weeks of vacation a year . They have little time for leisure or renewal . They might be stressed by unexpected medical bills that hit their savings . They might be unable to send their children to college , leaving their children with lower skills and lower earning potential . Those students who manage to go to college graduate with huge debt . Graduates are carrying a college debt of $1.2 trillion . They can not buy furniture or a home , or even afford to get married . In such a case , we would guess that GDP went up but the nation 's average well-being and happiness went down . <p> We badly need to add new measures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing an annual measure of gross domestic happiness ( GDH ) or gross domestic well-being ( GDW ) . We know that citizens in Scandinavian countries enjoy a substantially higher level of happiness and well-being than American citizens and run good economies . Is our addiction to consuming , consuming us ? <p> Part of the problem of economic growth is that the fruits of gains in productivity are not shared equitably . This is obvious in a country with a growing number of billionaires and a great number of poor workers . Many CEOs are paid 300 times what their average worker earns , and some take home as much as 1100 times the average worker . The economic system is rigged . Corporations have succeeded in emasculating trade unions and leaving workers with no say in what they or their bosses should be paid . <p> Even some billionaires are unhappy with this greatly lopsided pay arrangement . Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have publicly called for raising the top income tax rate . This top rate is now down to 37% as a result of the 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70% and manage to run a good economy , one with free health care and free college education . One citizen billionaire , Nick Hanauer has spoken about this on TED . He warns his fellow billionaires that " the pitchforks are coming . " He pleads with them to pay higher wages and taxes and share more of the productivity gains with the working class . The working class should earn enough to eat well , pay rent , and retire with adequate savings . Today there are too many workers who could n't muster $400 to pay for a pressing payment they must make . <p> Capitalism Faces the COVID-19 Crisis <p> Capitalism will change for other reasons as well . If more consumers decide to be anti-consumerists , they will spend less . Their spending has traditionally supported 70% of our economy . If this goes down , our economy contracts in size . A slowdown in economic growth will lead to more unemployment . Add the fact that more jobs are being lost to artificial intelligence ( AI ) and robots . This will require capitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food stamps , food kitchens , and social assistance . <p> Capitalism will have to print more money . We see this happening with the $2 trillion outlay voted by Congress to help support desperate workers in the face of the COVID-19 crisis . And $2 trillion is only to tide over the situation in the short run . More trillions will have to be spent . This means huge deficits that ca n't be covered by existing tax revenues . To the extent possible , tax rates will have to be dramatically increased . The lives of the rich are normally not affected by the grief and hardship of the poor . But now it is time for the rich to pay more and share more . In our current crisis , CEOs and their highly paid staffs have to take a cut in their pay . Boeing 's executives recently set an example by saying they will work with no pay during the coming crisis . <p> When the COVID-19 crisis is over , capitalism will have moved to a new stage . Consumers will be more thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consume . Here are possible developments : <p> 1 . Some weaker companies and brands will vanish . Consumers will have to find reliable and satisfying replacement brands . <p> 2 . The Coronavirus makes us aware of how fragile our health is . We can catch colds easily in crowds . We must stop shaking hands when we meet and greet . We need to eat more healthy foods to have a greater resistance to germs and flus . <p> 3 . We are shocked by the inadequacy of our health system and its great cost . We need to stay out of the hospital and play safe . <p> 4 . The sudden loss of jobs will remain a trauma even after workers get jobs back . They will spend and save their money more carefully . <p> 5 . Staying home led many consumers to become producers of their own food needs . More home cooking , more gardening to grow vegetables and herbs . Less eating out . <p> 6 . We place more value on the needs of our family , friends and community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends to choose good and healthy foods and buy more sensible clothing and other goods . <p> 7 . We will want brands to spell out their greater purpose and how each is serving the common good . <p> 8 . People will become more conscious of the fragility of the planet , of air and water pollution , of water shortages , and other problems . <p> More people will seek to achieve a better balance between work , family and leisure . Many will move from an addiction to materialism to sensing other paths to a good life . They will move to post-consumerism . <p> Capitalism remains the best engine for efficient economic growth . It also can be the best engine for equitable economic growth . It does n't change to socialism when we raise taxes on the rich . We have given up on the false economic doctrine that the poor win when the rich get richer . Actually , the rich will get richer mainly by leaving more money in the hands of working class families to spend . <p> As the coronavirus crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best interest of all -- rich and poor alike . It is time to rethink and rewire capitalism and transform it into a more equitable form -- based on democracy and social justice . Either we will learn to share more like Scandinavian countries , or we will become a banana republic .

ActionFraud , the UK 's national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrimes , saw covid-19-related frauds increase by 400% . <p> Remember that it 's only rarely that you will get back the money lost to cyber fraud . Here are some recent covid-19-related frauds prevalent in India and ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hard-earned money . <p> Things to keep in mind <p> Common tricks <p> Most of the covid-19-related frauds have a simple modus operandi and are easily executed by taking advantage of the lack of awareness of the victim . <p> Loan moratorium fraud : Most banks , NBFCs and different police departments have cautioned borrowers on social media about this . Fraudsters call up gullible borrowers and pose as bank representatives . They inform the targets that their lenders are giving a moratorium on the loan and the borrower wo n't need to pay two EMIs , as per the Reserve Bank of India 's directives . In the process , they can trick borrowers into sharing their bank details . Once they convince the borrowers , fraudsters ask them to share the OTP ( one-time password ) by giving them the impression that the OTP is the confirmation code for availing the moratorium , when actually it is for a bank transaction that borrowers may be doing . Once the borrower shares the OTP , he loses money . <p> " There is only one rule to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share any details with anyone , " said Prashant Mali , a Mumbai-based lawyer and cybersecurity expert . <p> Experts said that these are typical social engineering frauds .

There were so many fake IDs that the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT-In ) also issued a warning along with banks , ministries and police departments recently . Even State Bank of India released an advisory to its customers to be cautious of fake IDs such as pmcarefund@sbi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once we came across the fake IDs , we jumped into action with partner banks in our ecosystem to act on it . We ensure that people were not able to make payment to these fake IDs , " said Praveena Rai , chief operating officer , NPCI . Most of these IDs have now been disabled . <p> Rai said that whenever a person is making a payment , the name of the receiver pops up in all the payments app , so that the sender is sure about the receiver . " This is a validation function that is a part of all apps , " said Rai . For PM CARES , the registered name is Pm Cares . For others , it would most likely be registered in the name of an individual . <p> There are also other fake donation messages sent out to help the poor during the covid-19 pandemic . Do n't donate to any social or religious organization unless you are sure where the money is going . <p> Exploiting greed : Many items such as face masks and sanitizers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made fake e-commerce websites selling such sought-after items that are in short supply .
