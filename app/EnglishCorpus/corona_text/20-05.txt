As of Monday , Los Angeles County had recorded fewer than 13,000 cases . <p> The Santa Clara County study concluded that the virus had infected 2.5% to 4.2% of residents here ; in LA , the estimated infection rate ranged from 2.8% to 5.6% . <p> The early studies set off a firestorm -- not only among academics taking to Twitter to debate sampling methods , false positives and Bayesian inferences with a furor reminiscent of the banning of @BabyYodaBaby -- but critics who believe the numbers show that COVID-19 is merely a partisan-driven flu hoax . <p> The showdown over a few percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fear of both a virus and an economic meltdown . <p> In response , on Sunday , the Stanford study 's authors said they are planning to soon release a detailed appendix that addresses many of the " constructive comments and suggestions " the team has received . <p> " This is exactly the way peer-review should work in scientific work , and we are looking forward to engaging with other scholars as we proceed in this important work , " said Dr. Jayanta Bhattacharya , professor of medicine at Stanford University , who along with colleague Dr. Eran Bendavid , also assisted with the USC study . <p> The estimate , posted on the website medRxiv , comes from a first-in-the-nation community study of newly available antibody tests of 3,300 Santa Clara County residents in early April . Like all other emerging COVID-19 research papers , the work had not been peer reviewed prior to its release . <p> Based on those tests , the authors contend that between 48,000 and 81,000 of the county 's 1.9 million residents had been infected with the virus as of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times more than the official count of cases at the time . <p> If true , it suggests that the large majority of people who contract COVID-19 recover without ever knowing they were infected .

Los Angeles authorities also peg their death rate at 0.2% based on the USC study . <p> Santa Clara County Executive Dr. Jeff Smith remains steadfast in his interpretation of the study 's findings : It suggests that asymptomatic people spread the virus , and that more than 95% of the population remains susceptible to infection . <p> " That all means that there is more risk than we initially were aware of , " said Smith , lamenting how some are using the study to challenge Bay Area health officials ' unprecedented stay-home orders . <p> Similarly , Los Angeles Department of Public Health 's chief science officer Dr. Paul Simon said Monday that the LA study " suggests that many folks out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or have mild symptoms ....

@@31814141 <h> There 's a lot riding on the success of the company 's potential treatment for COVID-19 . <p> How well Gilead Sciences ( NASDAQ:GILD ) does this year will inevitably depend on how effective the company 's antiviral drug , remdesivir , is in treating COVID-19 . If the drug proves to be a flop , the stock will fall from where it is today . However , if the treatment is effective and widespread adoption looks imminent , then Gilead 's stock is likely headed skyward , hitting new all-time highs along the way . <p> Unfortunately , thus far , there have been conflicting results surrounding whether the drug can help COVID-19 patients . Let 's take a closer look at the remdesivir results and what they mean for investors to decide whether the stock is a buy or not . <h> Here 's how the data has shaken out <p> On April 23 , the results of a remdesivir study in China were released to the public . And although the study did n't have enough patients to be completed , the initial results showed that for adults with severe COVID-19 , remdesivir " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one month , 13.9% of patients who received remdesivir died compared to 12.8% of patients in the control arm . <p> Gilead discounted the results . The company 's spokesperson Amy Flood said the study " had too few patients " to be meaningful ; just 158 patients took redesivir and 79 patients in the control group . The company also said the data suggested the drug had a potential benefit if patients used it in the early stages of COVID-19 . <p> Image source : Getty Images . <p> But not even a week later , on April 29 , the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) released data from its study which indicated more positive results for remdesivir . The study involved 1,063 patients and the results showed that using remdesivir led to quicker recovery times . Patients with COVID-19 who took remdesivir had a median recovery time of 11 days compared to 15 days for those who took the placebo . The mortality rate of 8% in the remdesivir group was also lower than the 11.6% of patients in the control group who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut , significant , positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery " and that " what it has proven is that a drug can block this virus . " <h> Why the results may be a little disappointing <p> Investors should disregard the study from China because the sample size is much smaller than the one from the NIAID , and it would be difficult to gain any strong conclusions from that data . COVID-19 has proven to be a volatile and unpredictable disease . Some people with COVID-19 have shown no symptoms , while others require hospitalization and in extreme cases , ventilators . Due to the disease 's complexity , a large sample size is needed to get a good cross-section of patients and more balanced results . <p> What 's disappointing is n't that the Chinese study showed no improvement but that the results from the NIAID were not definitive in showing that remdesivir stopped the virus . While the median recovery time did improve by four days , it 's not the slam dunk that investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop COVID-19 in its tracks and that it can completely prevent fatalities . But at the very least , the study was positive , and there 's hope that remdesivir can reduce hospitalizations and deaths from the disease . <h> More definitive answers could be coming soon <p> The good news is that there will be a lot more data coming in the weeks ahead that will provide more insight into the drug 's effectiveness . On Friday , the Food and Drug Administration gave remdesivir emergency use authorization so that it can be used to treat patients with severe COVID-19 , which the agency defined as " patients with low blood oxygen levels or needing oxygen therapy or more intensive breathing support such as a mechanical ventilator . " <p> With more patients now able to access remdesivir , it will help give medical professionals more insight into how the drug works and which scenarios it 's effective and in which it 's not . And that can go a long way in arriving at some more definitive conclusions as to how useful remdesivir can be in the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The key takeaway from the results thus far is that it 's just too early to tell whether remdesivir will be a success in the battle against the coronavirus . As more patients are treated with remdesivir , there 'll be more clarity as to which situations it works best in and which it does n't . There 's still a lot of optimism that remdesivir can help treat COVD-19 patients , and there 's potential to make the stock one of the hottest buys of 2020 . <p> But even without remdesivir , Gilead 's still a good dividend stock to own . It pays a quarterly dividend of $0.68 , which yields 3.4% annually -- more than you 'd earn from the average S&amp;P 500 stock that pays just 2% per year . Gilead 's stock is up around 25% this year , as it has also outperformed the index this year , which is down 12% . <p> At a price-to-earnings ratio of 18 , Gilead is n't a terribly risky buy today , even if remdesivir fails to live up to the hype . The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's been in the black in each of the past 10 years . In the past two years , its profit margin has been a very healthy 24% of revenue . <p> Gilead released its first-quarter results of 2020 on April 30 , which showed revenue growth of 5% from the prior-year period . And although the company 's net income was down by 21% from where it was a year ago , that was largely due to higher taxes and other expenses ; Gilead 's operating income was 7% higher than Q1 2019 . <p> Overall , there are good reasons to invest in the healthcare stock even without remdesivir , and that 's why Gilead 's still an attractive buy even if the drug fails . And if it succeeds , the sky 's the limit for Gilead.

If there 's one thing that may stop hospitals from trying to reuse masks 20 times or more , it 's the elastic bands that hold them to the face ; everyone seems to agree they break down at that point , or sooner . <p> Munster declined to comment on why the FDA is allowing 20 cleanings , while his group had only tested for three .

@@31819641 <h> Youth Observer <h> Sri Lanka 's foreign exchange woes <p> Growing pressure on Sri Lanka 's scarce foreign exchange resources , due to the spread of COVID-19 across the globe , is now more real than ever before . To ease this pressure , the Central Bank of Sri Lanka ( CBSL ) has taken many measures to attract and retain more foreign exchange in Sri Lanka . <p> On March 19 , the CBSL curtailed the import of non-essential goods , followed by the relaxation of its foreign exchange regulations on April 2 . The CBSL invited Sri Lankans and well-wishers living in the country and abroad to deposit their savings and other funds in foreign currency to the Sri Lankan banking system . <p> This invitation came with the assurance that such deposits will be accepted without any hindrance from the government , CBSL , or any other authority . More recently , the Finance Minister suspended outward remittances , other than current transactions through Business or Personal Foreign Currency Accounts , reduced the first time migration allowance to a maximum of USD 30,000 , and introduced a Special Deposit Account , which can be opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rate . <p> Yet , it is uncertain if these efforts alone would be able to address Sri Lanka 's deepening foreign exchange concerns . This blog highlights the importance of remittances to Sri Lanka and outlines how to harness the potential of international remittances to complement other efforts already taken by the CBSL . <p> Remittance economy <p> Sri Lanka is often identified as a remittance economy , due its heavy reliance on remittances . In 2019 , the Sri Lankan economy received USD 6.7 billion as remittances , which was capable of covering 84% of its trade deficit . Moreover , recent estimates show that one in every 11 households received international remittances , migrants normally remit once a month , and the average amount remitted is Rs. 40,000 per month . <p> Seasonality of remittances <p> Remittances to Sri Lanka are seasonal , and traditionally , peak in the months of April , right before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year , and in December , the month of Christmas . During the five year period from 2015 to 2019 , on average , March has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Lockdowns <p> However , by the end of March 2020 , a majority of the top destination countries of Sri Lankan migrant workers had come under lockdown , in an effort to combat the spread of COVID-19 . <p> For instance , around March 9 , all schools and universities were closed in Qatar and Saudi Arabia , followed by the subsequent closure of all restaurants , cafes , food outlets , and food trucks in popular areas . <p> By March 20 , many labour camps in Qatar -- home to migrant workers in the construction sector - were also locked down . Similarly , a large expanse of the industrial areas in Qatar employing migrant workers , was also locked down . <p> While some migrant workers continue to get paid , others in these labour camps and industrial areas were provided no pay leave , with facilities for food and accommodation . <p> Adding fuel to the flame , the rift between Saudi Arabia and Russia over the supply of oil , in the wake of declining demand for oil in the world market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since March 9 . Together with other issues related to COVID-19 in countries of destination ( COD ) , the impending global recession means less stability and job security for Sri Lankan-origin migrant workers , who under normal circumstances would remit regularly . <p> Travel bans <p> While migrant workers living abroad were locked down , new or returning migrants from Sri Lanka were temporarily banned from entering many countries of destination by mid-March . <p> Initially Qatar imposed a travel ban that restricted Sri Lankan origin migrant workers entering the country , while Kuwait and Saudi Arabia followed suit by mid-March . Subsequently , on 14 March , the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau ( SLBFE ) restricted migrant workers leaving the country for foreign employment . As such , the regular flow of migrant departures were curtailed in mid-March , resulting in a decline in the stock of migrant workers overseas , and thereby , triggering the likely decline in remitters . <p> Migrants and remittances <p> The decline in the stock of migrants and the economic difficulties faced by those in CODs translate into lower remittances to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing of the lockdowns made it harder to remit their wages via traditional methods , such as visiting a bank or a money transfer operator ( MTO ) . For those who were not paid , remitting to Sri Lanka was not even an option , especially under the growing concerns about their job security . <p> Remittance channels <p> Under normal circumstances , most migrant workers of Sri Lankan origin prefer to remit money via the banking channel , mainly as a result of information provided during pre-departure training in Sri Lanka . <p> For instance , in a sample of 602 migrant households in Sri Lankan , 81% indicated that remittances from the countries of destination were sent via banks , while another 9% used MTOs . <p> For most female domestic workers in the Middle East , the nature of work and workplace enable remittances through a bank account of the employer , often via online bank transfers . High skilled migrants are also most likely to adopt online methods for remittances . Such groups are less likely to be affected by lockdowns and curfews to remit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers other than female domestic workers are more likely to rely on traditional brick and mortar methods for remittances , and are likely to be the ones to cut back on their remittances to Sri Lanka in these trying times . <p> Informal and illegal remittance channels <p> Some migrants resort to informal and illegal channels , mainly due to the lower cost of remitting , and other reasons , such as absence of a need to prove legal status in COD and door-step delivery in Sri Lanka . Recent estimates indicate that the average cost of remitting to Sri Lanka via the banking channels is 5.4% of the amount remitted , while via the MTO channels the cost is 3.7% . There are no reliable estimates about the share of remittances sent via informal and illegal channels , or its cost . <p> The informal and illegal channels of remittances operate by the remittance service provider collecting remittances in the COD ( in foreign currency ) , and distributing the same in Sri Lanka using his/her Rupee funds in Sri Lanka , often through a partner here . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foreign exchange destined to Sri Lanka remains in the COD . <p> This is a serious concern in the current context , with the decline of foreign exchange to Sri Lanka . <p> Future scenario <p> The travel restrictions on many countries are likely to remain effective in the next couple of months , eliminating the possibility of departures for the already processed and approved job orders from Sri Lanka . On the other hand , the approaching global recession will decrease the demand for foreign workers.At the same time , migrant workers currently in CODs will undergo severe economic stress , or will be compelled to return to Sri Lanka if rendered unemployed . <p> Similarly , the migrant workers , who were able to return to Sri Lanka , especially from Italy , before the closure of borders in mid-March , are very likely to be laid off , and not have a job to return to in the future . As such , even after the travel restrictions are lifted , the availability of employment opportunities for migrant workers from Sri Lanka would be slim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stock of Sri Lankan origin migrant workers , and thereby a drop in remittances to Sri Lanka in 2020 . <p> Way forward <p> In this context , to address the growing foreign exchange concerns , Sri Lanka needs to adopt aggressive measures to increase the amount of foreign exchange received as international remittances in 2020 . In addition to the already proposed measure by the CBSL , the following are some strategies to maximise the receipt of remittances to Sri Lanka in 2020 : <p> 1 . Encourage migrant workers currently under lockdown in CODs to adopt online methods to remit money to Sri Lanka . The SLBFE and the Ministry of Foreign Employment can adopt a targeted social media campaign to reach Sri Lankan migrant workers abroad . <p> 2 . Encourage Sri Lankan banks operating in CODs to adopt doorstep collection methods to encourage remittances by Sri Lankans in lockdown .

The data from France show that all too clearly . <p> Hear hear . The free market meant there were no customers and staff were scared to go to work . All the first companies that closed did so because no one was coming through their doors - Starbucks and Apple being two of the first . That 's capitalism . It was n't forced closures at all . <p> That 's only true if you think that no clubs are going to go into liquidation .

Thus the FCC is at liberty , it would seem , to pass judgement on whatsoever it chooses , but must submit to rulings from a higher court . <p> America will only bounce back if it uses its military and intelligence might to bully others , like toppling the Shah of Iran and wondering why Iranians cry Death to America . They are so disingenuous the Americans . They happily lie to themselves and they lap up their own myth-making . Utter bullies .

America 's failure is its constant need to find an enemy and abject failure to recognise and own up to any of its many , many errors . <p> I asked you not anyone else . Beijing or LA or any where in the whole of that great country . The world loves the USA and always has . Why do you think millions want to go there ? Nobody emigrates to China .

It has no right to tell other nations what to do , when it has failed its own people and is so deeply rotten from within . Gun toting white supremacists intimidating the government and the people ? No thanks . That 's ISIS . A total fall from grace , the American dream shattered . <p> Not just because , and you know that v. well .

We 'll soon see if there is a U.S.-UK FTA &amp; what this entails . <p> My point is that the leader of Hungary responded to the Corona pandemic by seizing power and effectively ending democracy in his country . <p> First they did stop the virus . We will see in a few months whether they cjhange politics or not . <p> While Germany looks like it has dealt with its response well now that might not look the same in 2 years time . Personally I think the Sweden model is the right way forward but no one will know for a while yet . <p> That does not make sense . If you check ICU beds and do some basic maths you will find the disadvantage of the Swedish model . Herd immunity means many infected old people . Sweden has even less ICU beds per million citizens than UK . <p> Germany has the claer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds , this should in all cases give a better result , even if better means Italian like situation during next winter . <p> You seem to be extremely argumentative but lacking the ability to construct a coherent argument . A strong opinion combined with complete ignorance of the subject matter . A damning combination . Have you thought about changing to the Daily Mail ? They love that sort of thing there . <p> What is becoming clear now that we are a couple of weeks in the crisis is that Europeans are looking for solutions and Americans are looking for whom to blame . The European way is obviously more successful with the virus more or less contained . In America the virus is still spreading rapidly and reports have been leaked to the press predicting a doubling of the daily death rate by the end of the month . View from europe : it 's clear that Americans have noone to blame but themselves .
@@31823941 <p> Have you listened to the comparison between the Covid-19 pandemic and electricity generation in Ghana ? Was it a harmonious sound blended of soprano , attenuated by a bass , highly pitched by a tenor or smoothened by an alto singer ? It simply never was a harmony . Forever , I think , it remains cacophony that is a mockery of common sense . <p> The reasons are not far-fetched as might be the case . Mathematically , fractions can best be compared when there is a common denominator . Do not be confused . Simply put , it is out of common sense to have a chameleon paired with a cheetah in a race . That would not be fair . To have a good comparison , it could be a cheetah of North America with a cheetah from Africa . A better one will be , comparing chameleon from North Africa to that from South Africa in a race , because they have a common base which is the Africa continent . At best , you can do a cheetah from Tema , and that from Accra and that would be deemed most fair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling in the same environment with same climatic conditions . That is why I am amazed at comparing the Covid-19 crisis to the lack of electricity generation . Kilowatts and Watts ( Electricity ) can not be compared with degrees Celsius ( Temperature ) . <p> Coronavirus pandemic has not touched base with electricity generation at all . In fact , the two are dichotomized and highly polarized like the sky from Kalahari Desert . Coronavirus pandemic is a global situation but the electricity generation was domestic . Coronavirus and for that matter , Covid-19 had directives , guidance and indeed clear set of protocols dictated by WHO . Electricity generation had no such protocols . Per the nature of Covid-19 , a regular update is necessary as part of the solution and that is not the case of electricity generation . COVID 19 , relies on Ghana Health Service and already established hospital facilities to tackle the situation . The generation of electricity does require an immediate building of electricity generation units . Indeed , whiles there might be a need to build more hospitals , doing that immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , building electrical power and purchasing electrical power generation units were immediately needed and remained the necessary and sufficient condition to stop " Dumsor " . <p> Covid-19 could kill people in a matter of days if not hours , the lack of electricity might do so perhaps in months and years . Covid-19 requires a lockdown . Since 1957 , when Ghana attained independence as a nation , there are villages in districts that are yet to have electricity . Such villages have never suffered a lockdown due to a lack of electricity . Covid-19 requires that we wash our hands frequently , the lack of electricity generation has no such requirement . Thus , the free water and the reduction in electricity cost , are simply part of the indirect solutions to Covid-19 . Covid-19 requires all public gatherings to stop , but I remember keeping wake in social gathering for departed souls without electricity in the past in my village . Without electricity , we were still going to schools but Covid-19 will simply not allow that . I could go on and on ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 with electricity generation ? This is just a mockery of common sense ! Such a comparison is not only inhumane but an insult to the intellectual independence of voters . The comparison demonstrated the extent to which politicians could go to play the advantage even on the verge of all of us dying . In a nutshell , it is a demonstration of how politicians can stop at nothing , just to have their grip firmly . I am simply stunned !

Even before levels three and four in March , the zoo had introduced mitigation methods to prevent the spread of Covid-19 .

@@31828841 <h> You 'll Probably Never Know If You Had the Coronavirus in January <p> Editor 's Note:The Atlantic is making vital coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers . Find the collection here . <p> There is no doubt that the coronavirus was spreading in the United States in January . We can at least start with that . Recently , California 's Santa Clara County reported that bodily tissues from a woman who died on February 6 tested positive for the coronavirus . She had not traveled outside the country , and based on what is known about the virus , she must have picked it up by January 31 ; in all likelihood , she was infected a week or two before that . The virus , it turned out , had been spreading in the United States well before we suspected , and weeks earlier than previous official estimates of community transmission had accounted for . <p> Of all the things we still do n't know about SARS-CoV-2 -- how far can it travel through the air ? What treatments can tame it ? How many people will it kill ? -- the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January has held a special allure . A reliable estimate could help determine just how bad the United States ' botched early response to the pandemic was . We already know that the government failed to detect as many as 28,000 infections by March 1 , so just how late to the game were we ? Knowing more about January infections could also offer clues to the true number of Americans who have now been infected -- thanks to a shortage of tests , the official count of 1.2 million is almost certainly too low . A firm number could inform our strategies for preventing subsequent waves of COVID-19 from becoming even more disastrous than the first . <p> Curiosity about January is n't driven only by the collective good . Many Americans are eager to know whether that lingering cough or punishing fever they had back in the winter was in fact COVID-19 . It 's tempting to believe that a sizable chunk of the population secretly carried the virus in January , because then there would be hope that anyone who came down with a suspicious illness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the very least , if the U.S. dramatically increased its estimate of January infections , Americans could have some scientific backing for mourning a death in the family as coronavirus-related . <p> Unfortunately , experts generally agree that the actual number of Americans carrying the virus by the end of January was nowhere near high enough to support speculation about herd immunity and star-studded superspreader events . Beyond that , the estimates vary widely . Lauren Gardner , an associate professor of engineering at Johns Hopkins University , who created the school 's popular dashboard for tracking coronavirus cases , told me that " there could have been hundreds of cases in the U.S. in January and thousands by the end of February . " Trevor Bedford , a biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who has been at the forefront of the genetic study of SARS-CoV-2 , says that " more than 10 , less than 100 would be my guess . " Caitlin Rivers , a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security , told me that she 's " confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it 's not millions . " <p> It is scientifically possible for a country months into an infectious-disease outbreak to determine with some certainty how many of its residents were infected in the first few weeks . The challenge is that doing so would require data about the United States and the rest of the world that are currently a mystery . Many Americans ' most pressing questions -- did I have the disease without knowing it ? When ? -- will remain unanswerable forever . But with time , we 're likely to gain some limited clarity about what exactly happened at the beginning of this year . And we 're probably not going to like what we find . <h> IMPORTED CASES <p> One crucial factor for estimating how many Americans were infected in January is understanding how many sick people traveled here in the first place . The more people who carried the virus into the country -- whether they were visitors or Americans returning home -- the more chances it would have had to cause large , undetected outbreaks . <p> By mid-February , 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. There 's good reason to believe the actual number was at least marginally higher . In February , epidemiologists at both Harvard and Imperial College London estimated that the world 's disease-surveillance systems caught only about one of every three infections exported from Wuhan , China , where the virus was first identified . According to Bedford , this ratio suggests that about 20 to 50 infected people arrived in the U.S. from China or other countries in January . <p> SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious , but a few dozen imported cases would probably not be enough to spark many major undetected outbreaks . Based on related diseases such as SARS and MERS , epidemiologists suspect that the coronavirus 's spreading potential is irregular . In all likelihood , some sick people infect many others , but most infect just a handful . Alessandro Vespignani , a network scientist and public-health professor at Northeastern University , estimates that in each American city that later became a hot spot for COVID-19 , perhaps 10 to 20 " local transmission events " occurred in January . Aside from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places such as Seattle and New York , most infections that arrived from outside the country in January would have been transmitted to at most a few people , then quickly " fizzle out , " Bedford told me . <p> Establishing a more precise number of how many sick people carried SARS-CoV-2 to the U.S. early this year would require data that can be difficult or impossible to collect , especially during a major global-health crisis . For one : how many people were actually sick with COVID-19 around the world in January ( or earlier ) . The official data out of Wuhan have been unreliable from the start . And countries that have since ramped up their coronavirus-detection efforts were not looking as carefully for cases at the beginning of the year . The World Health Organization did not declare a global-health emergency until January 30 . <p> Researchers would also need to know where people traveled around the world in the early weeks of the pandemic . " One of the big challenges of looking at actual global spread of this disease is that , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gardner said . When researchers do n't have perfect travel data for a time and place they 're studying , she explained , they often substitute or extrapolate from data in the recent past . " Sometimes you can say , ' Well , I do n't have 2016 data , but I 'm using 2015 data . That 's representative . ' That does not apply anymore . " The Chinese government shut down Wuhan on January 23 ; even before then , individual people 's movement patterns might have begun to shift in ways that are difficult to track . <h> MORTALITY NUMBERS <p> When the living can not be fully accounted for , one way to move forward is to tally the dead . Testing shortages mean that some COVID-19 deaths have gone undetected , but researchers can get a better handle on just how many people the virus killed during a given time period by looking at the excess mortality : how many more people died than would have been expected to under normal circumstances . <p> Last week , the National Center for Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 , which will be updated as the pandemic wears on . Bob Anderson , the chief of the NCHS 's mortality-statistics branch , told me that it 's " the first time we 've done something like this before the data were final . " The hope is that researchers can use the gross numbers to estimate how many Americans died of COVID-19 over a particular period , and from there estimate how many Americans were infected . But picking out excess deaths in the first few weeks of this year will be difficult . Compared with the hundreds of thousands of deaths the country experiences in a typical month , a handful of COVID-19 deaths would hardly be a blip . Indeed , by the NCHS 's count , the United States did not exceed the expected number of deaths by a significant margin until the week of March 22 . <p> Even if the U.S. is able to more precisely nail down excess winter deaths a few months from now , using those numbers to calculate COVID-19 infections would depend on very accurate estimates of the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun , a postdoc at the National Institutes of Health 's Multinational Influenza Seasonal Mortality Study . Those estimates are just not there yet . Gardner pointed out that the case fatality rate of COVID-19 has been inconsistently reported , and that making reliable calculations with it will be hard until numbers from around the world start to balance out , which " could easily take through the year . " <p> Cities and states around the country could consider following Santa Clara 's lead and combing through autopsy data of people who died earlier this year . " A routine part of the autopsy is to collect various tissue samples , " James Gill , Connecticut 's chief medical examiner , told me . Those tissues -- pieces of the deceased 's lungs , heart , and so on -- might be kept for six months to a year , or preserved in paraffin wax and stored for several years . They could be tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 whenever anyone decided to look at them . <p> California Governor Gavin Newsom recently ordered the state 's coroners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been hesitant to make similar commitments . Gill estimates that less than 10 percent of patients who die in hospitals get autopsies . Combined with the small number of coronavirus deaths that likely occurred in January and February , this limited pool of autopsy data means that few COVID-19 infections are likely to be captured . Reviewing tissues from January and February autopsies could produce a few needles in the haystack , and perhaps push back the timeline of community spread in the U.S. even further . But medical examiners are unlikely to find enough infected samples to draw any meaningful conclusions about how many deaths in the first few weeks of the year were actually COVID-19 -- related . <h> BLOOD TESTS <p> A third possible approach involves evidence that the virus leaves behind in the blood . After the human body fights off a viral infection , the immune system continues to produce antibodies -- proteins that can recognize the invader if it returns . Right now , blood tests can tell you if coronavirus antibodies exist in your body at the time of testing , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were exposed to the virus . If scientists can pin down how long coronavirus antibodies stick around in the body , accurate serology tests would tell a patient the earliest possible date they were exposed . <p> During the course of any viral infection , the human body produces different proportions of different kinds of antibodies . Gigi Gronvall , an immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security , told me that with enough data , researchers could theoretically determine the antibody ratios likely to be found in the blood at different numbers of days or weeks postinfection . But , Gronvall said , individual variation in antibody ratios would be common . So even if a study like this were attempted , the best it could do is predict what proportion of many , many blood samples indicate an infection around January ; such a method probably could n't determine when exactly a specific person 's infection occurred . <p> Given that scientists have yet to settle on how long the body produces any SARS-CoV-2 antibodies , no one should be optimistic that a system like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . Just determining the immunity window of the virus could take " months and years , " according to Rivers , the senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security . " The virus has only really existed in the world , as far as we know , for a few months . And so we just have n't been able to study it over time . " <p> Bedford , the biologist who has studied genetic changes in SARS-CoV-2 , suggested a simpler way to get around the time-blindness of serological tests : Use blood from January . He explained that often , when patients have their blood drawn for testing in a hospital , the hospital keeps the sample and makes it available to researchers , who will know only the date the blood was drawn and the patient 's age . Testing a critical mass of blood drawn in January to see what percentage has antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 could help modelers infer what percentage of the entire U.S. population was infected . <p> Such a plan , though , would work only with serological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available . As Bedford explained , about 1 percent of results from the current tests are likely to be false positives . There 's some math involved , but the upshot is that until more than 1 percent of the population is infected -- about 3 million people nationwide -- you ca n't actually draw any conclusions from the results . The odds that 3 million Americans had COVID-19 in January are slim to none . <h> THE BOTTOM LINE <p> After Bedford explained to me how retrospective blood tests would work , he clarified that they " probably should n't have strong research priority . " Other experts I spoke with agreed that chasing after precise numbers from January is unlikely to bring the closure Americans might be looking for , or make a tremendous difference in what we as a country choose to do next . Even if we could wave a magic wand and drop the exact number of infections for the month into every epidemiological model we have , " I do n't know that there 's any immediate changes that we would make to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Still , there are some benefits to determining more precisely just how many infections escaped America 's detection in the first weeks of the year . Peter Hotez , a dean at the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine , mentioned that many countries in the Global South are still in the earliest stages of their own outbreaks . The more information that public-health experts in those places can get about how COVID-19 began to spread through the U.S. , along with Europe and East Asia , the better they can address local risks . <p> It 's not just other countries : In all likelihood , the United States will face more waves of COVID-19 before the disease is brought to heel by a vaccine or herd immunity , both of which are months if not years off . We will probably , in a matter of weeks or months , find ourselves at a point along the epidemiological curve that is more similar to late January than mid-March . Repeating the same mistakes would be a tragedy . " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epidemic , so that then , at the end of another four weeks or six weeks , we have to shut down everything again , " Vespignani , the Northeastern professor , told me . <p> After weeks of our political leaders offering revisionist histories and lies about the severity of the outbreak in the United States , providing a close-to-exact portrait of the beginning of the outbreak might also help quell rumors that COVID-19 has been secretly spreading through pockets of the country since the fall . These theories can lead people to think that immunity is far more widespread than it actually is , and therefore encourage them to flout social-distancing guidelines . This is especially concerning as dozens of states , against the advice of public-health experts , have eased or made plans to ease legal restrictions around nonessential businesses and travel . <p> To those of us desperate for any sort of certainty right now , January can seem like a good contender for a solvable mystery . But even if we did settle on a more precise tally of infections , it would not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already clear enough to show that , unless you traveled to Wuhan in December or January or were in close contact with someone who did , any flu-like symptoms you experienced in the first month of the year were most likely not caused by SARS-CoV-2 . More precise numbers could marginally change our understanding of who might be immune , but they will not change the reality of the nightmare we 're living through . This is a hard truth to swallow . We still have a long way to go before we can return to work and pass others on the sidewalk and hug without fear . <p> Even so , the more knowledge we have about how this crisis began , the more power we might have to shape how it ends . Despite all the barriers to deducing the pandemic 's history , Vespignani said that modeling the future is still more difficult . Modelers have to consider human behavior , policy , and testing resources , which are shaped not only by the speed of science but by political and economic will .

@@31832741 <h> Big Oil 's Reign Is Finally Weakening <p> The removal of the former ExxonMobil C.E.O . Lee Raymond as the lead independent director of JPMorgan Chase 's board is a climate-activist victory.Photograph from Fort Worth Star-Telegram / ZUMA <p> Subscribers to The Climate Crisis newsletter received this piece in their in-boxes . Sign up to receive future installments . <p> On some long-distant day when some as-yet-unborn historian sits down to write the story of climate change -- the story of the greatest crisis humans ever faced -- it 's possible that they 'll choose an anecdote from this past week as a way into the story . Amid the coronavirus pandemic , it understandably did n't get much notice , but JPMorgan Chase announced on Friday that Lee Raymond will no longer serve as the lead independent director of the world 's largest lender to the fossil-fuel industry . <p> I 've told the backstory at much greater length here , but , briefly : Raymond was a key Exxon executive from the nineteen-eighties onward -- the years when the company was one of the most profitable in the world . ( If you want a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ) Those were also the years when Exxon 's scientists discovered -- before it was publicly an issue -- that climate change was real and dangerous , and when Exxon 's executives decided to join with others in the industry to cover up that truth . Raymond gave the single most audacious speech of the era , telling a World Petroleum Congress audience in 1997 , on the eve of the Kyoto climate talks , that the planet was cooling , and that it made no difference if we acted then or waited a quarter century . <p> Raymond retired from Exxon as C.E.O. , in 2005 , having earned a reported six hundred and eighty-six million dollars ; in his retirement , his job was to help run the board at Chase . Advocates have urged Chase to remove him as lead independent director because of his climate-denying past , and last month the New York City comptroller , Scott Stringer , joined the fight , pledging to vote the city pension fund 's Exxon shares against Raymond ; he persuaded the New York State comptroller and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . One can only speculate , but this clearly put pressure on giant investors such as BlackRock , who have been making climate-friendly noises ; in any event , as the Financial Timesreported , Chase has removed Raymond from his position , though he remains on the board . <p> The effect is probably practical and definitely symbolic -- Raymond 's removal ratifies the notion that , after a decade of relentless campaigning by activists , Big Oil is no longer quite as big . It 's true that , in the same week , much of the industry got the bailout that it had been asking for from Washington . But that was scant cause for celebration : the International Energy Agency released new numbers , predicting that global oil demand would drop nine per cent this year . As economists at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis pointed out , the fossil-fuel sector really faces long-term solvency problems , not just short-term liquidity woes . Demand growth had been slowing in recent years , as regulatory pressure began to mount , as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even before COVID-19 really bit , Exxon had been " humbled , " according to Bloomberg Businessweek , becoming a " mediocre " company . Now it seems entirely likely that we have seen peak oil demand , a moment that the oil companies had predicted would n't come for decades . Here 's the energy analyst Kingsmill Bond 's precis : " If demand for fossil fuels bounces back in 2021 by half the amount it fell in 2020 , and grows at 0.5% a year , it would take 8 years to get back to where the industry started . And in the meantime , the renewable energy revolution has not stopped . " <p> This process will accelerate in places where governments rebuild their economies with Green New Deals , and lag in places where a move back to private cars combines with cheap gas prices to keep the S.U.V. era alive a little longer . But the key point is that , as the industry flags , so will its political power .

Our connection with nature is ancestral -- it 's in our DNA .

We are a community that is ready to act on the climate emergency and that wants to be a part of the solution . The challenge we face is to insure that those communities have a platform and the necessary resources and information to work on solutions and live sustainable lives . <p> What are the other issues that really draw a strong response on " Planeta Tierra " ? <p> " Planeta Tierra " shines a light on the greatest challenges we are facing today , from plastic pollution to the loss of biodiversity and deforestation . But we frame our stories on solutions . We look for the stories of people who are making a difference . For example , entrepreneurs who are rethinking their way of doing business and creating more sustainable products .

@@31832941 <p> From the living room window of her Brooklyn apartment , Alix Monteleone watched the team of workers assemble the morgue in stages over the weekend . First , they parked the refrigerated trailer along the curb , a white box about the size of a large shipping container . Then , they built a wooden ramp to allow hospital staff to wheel the bodies inside . Finally , on Monday , the workers erected a wall of panels , thin and white , to stop passersby from staring or getting too close to the dead . <p> After that , the gawkers mostly went away . But Monteleone , a 28-year-old event planner from Long Island , kept up her vigil from the third-floor window . <p> " I spend my entire day like this , " she says , propping her elbows onto the back of her couch and looking out toward the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center , the hospital across the street . " I still ca n't believe what I 'm seeing . " <p> Workers build shelves for a makeshift morgue outside Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn , New York , on March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . <p> Benjamin Norman for TIME <p> The deployment of temporary morgues across the city -- known to emergency planners as Body Collection Points , or BCPs -- marks a new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic for New Yorkers , whose city has rapidly become the global center of the crisis . By late Monday , the state 's death toll had surpassed 1,200 , with more than 66,000 confirmed infections . More than 900 of the deaths were in New York City . <p> Until now , it had been largely possible for residents to shut out the worst of this calamity , retreat into their homes and only go out for short trips around the neighborhood , all without confronting anything more grim than empty streets and people wearing face masks . <p> The arrival of the morgues and makeshift hospitals -- which have been installed in public spaces -- has thrust the pandemic into full view as it envelops the nation 's largest city , making this escapism difficult . Anyone strolling through Central Park could observe a field hospital erected on the lawns to alleviate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop-up hospital has been set up at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan , and on Monday , the Navy ship Comfort docked in New York to take on more patients . <p> Marc Kozlow , 33 , and Alix Monteleone , 28 , look out their window toward Wyckoff Heights Medical Center on March 30 . In one weekend , after a temporary morgue was erected outside , they counted more than a dozen bodies . " I want to know , " Monteleone says , referencing the temporary morgue parked nearby . " I want to know the body count . " <p> Benjamin Norman for TIME <p> The largest temporary morgue in New York City occupies a tent set up over the weekend outside Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan . " We have them at public and private hospitals throughout the boroughs , " says Aja Worthy-Davis , a spokesperson for the office of the chief medical examiner , the city agency responsible for caring for the dead . At least four had been set up as of Monday , she said : two in Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We expect to start utilizing the large tent in Bellevue soon . " <h> Related Stories <p> Keep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here . <p> Ramon Rodriguez , the President and CEO of the Wyckoff Heights hospital , says it was not his decision to deploy the refrigerated truck , but he is thankful that the office of the medical examiner was able to provide it to his facility , whose morgue can only house nine bodies at a time . " Over the last three weeks we have filled that morgue many times over , " he says of the hospital 's usual morgue space . <p> The bodies in the refrigerated truck are being picked up by funeral homes for burial as quickly as possible , adds Rodriguez . Given the distress this process was likely to cause local residents , placing the truck on a public street was not an easy decision , he says . But the hospital had no other viable place to put the trailer , which is 53 feet long . <p> " We want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left this earth and those who live across the street , " says Rodriguez . And the need for extra privacy is why the hospital put an enclosure around the wooden ramp leading to the trailer . <p> Under the New York City medical examiner 's protocols for a pandemic , the deployment of temporary morgues becomes necessary when the death toll tops 200 per day , overwhelming the capacity of hospitals to store bodies safely . New York City passed that threshold last week , triggering a new " mobilization level " in the city -- the third level on a scale of six -- according to a copy of the chief medical examiner 's pandemic " surge plan " for handling the dead , which Worthy-Davis shared with TIME . <p> Drafted in 2008 to prepare for a devastating flu pandemic , the plan envisions far more dramatic measures of " mass fatality management " if the virus continues to spread . Officials at Rikers Island , the city 's main jail , could put inmates to work burying some of the dead in the city-run public cemetery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current level of mobilization , the city must also draw up contracts with cemeteries that can accommodate temporary mass graves , which the plan describes in jarring detail : " Ten bodies in caskets are placed lengthwise in a long narrow section in the ground . " <p> Workers transport a casket-sized box near the morgue set up outside Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn on March 30 . <p> Benjamin Norman for TIME <p> By comparison , the installation of temporary morgues would seem like a measure New Yorkers could stomach . But it has been enough to unsettle the neighbors of the Wyckoff Heights hospital . Before the refrigerated trailer arrived on Friday , Monteleone and her fiance , Marc Kozlow , had gotten used to the routines of confinement and boredom that come with social distancing . They took turns walking their dog Hank around the neighborhood . She had tried doing needlepoint to pass the time . He had started baking sourdough in the kitchen . <p> But by Saturday , when they saw the first bodies taken on gurneys from the hospital and carried into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home began to dim . " If a nuclear reactor is exploding near you , you do n't stay near the hot zone , " says Kozlow , 33 . " You get out . " <p> Although they understood from news reports that the hospital across the street was quickly filling with COVID-19 patients last week , the reality only sank in after they began to see the bodies , some of them zipped into bags , others wrapped in what appeared to be white bed sheets . They counted more than a dozen over the weekend . <p> Monteleone keeps insisting they stay . " This is my home , " she says in the living room of their one-bedroom apartment . " The only semblance of control I have in my life right now is staying in my home . So we just need to adjust . We need to close the blinds .

" To have an event that we 're responding to in every county of the state , all at the same time , that 's evolving this way when there 's so many unknowns , we simply can not do this without our partners . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors in the same building , including a conference room command center where twice daily briefings are held with the leadership of each organization . <p> About 140 people now work at unified command every day , providing the state its constantly updated data on the virus , organizing the distribution of personal protective equipment across the state and cleaning and disinfecting nursing homes and other facilities that have had outbreaks . <p> Retired Col. Jim Hawkins of the Alabama National Guard came back from the private sector to coordinate the unified command structure and make sure those agencies work together effectively . About half of the people working there are in the Guard , but Hawkins said the state health department is running the show . <p> " Public health personnel are embedded across all areas , " Hawkins said . " Anything we do should look like a normal public health solution . " <p> Inside the unified command , it might look like a typical , if sparsely decorated , office suite with an unusual dress code . Each division has taken over conference rooms on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a field of cubicles . <p> In addition to the printed signs listing the occupants of each conference room or cubicle , there are a handful of motivational posters and signs to keep up morale . <p> A printed sign on the doorway of the medical operations division reminds those called there to stay on mission . <p> " I am still falling but since the parachute slowed my fall that means it 's okay to take it off now ? " the signs asks , over a cartoon Wile E. Coyote and clipart of three parachuters gliding down to safety . " You are making a difference ! ! Stay the course ! ! ! " <p> Another sign says " Keep calm what we do is hard , " in the style of the British campaign to carry on during World War II . <p> Inside the conference rooms , the walls are plastered with maps of the state of Alabama , organizational charts with contact information for the leaders of various divisions and status updates written on butcher paper . <p> In the data division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care facilities about how many beds , ventilators and intensive care unit spaces are available , providing as close to real-time information as possible to the Department of Public Health and the state . <p> " There 's a lot of different data streams , so one of the challenges is , how do you take all that disparate data and put it together in a package that enables sound discussions on policy and policy decisions ? " Hawkins said . " We 're not making policy in the unified command . We 're arming the administration with the facts . " <p> The logistics division takes requests from medical facilities and first responders around the state for more protective equipment like masks and gloves and uses National Guard or Alabama Forestry Commission to distribute material from the state 's stockpile to places where it 's most needed . <p> Procurement officer Bethany Elliott , who works for the Forestry Commission , said tracking down that PPE is getting somewhat easier , but is still a challenge . <p> " Our normal supply chains were almost non-existent , they just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we needed to go outside of the normal supply chains , " Elliott said .

" Those are lightweight gowns that you typically see in a lab setting that we could use a lot of those . If you 've got an empty factory somewhere and you want to start making gowns that 'd be perfect . " <p> Not everything is in short supply , however .

Lisa Pierce , who leads that division . " If you try to hire a company , it might cost about $10,000 to do that , so that 's a free service provided by the Guard . " <p> The unified command structure was implemented in late March , as the response to the disease was already well underway . Hawkins said the arrangement was like " building an airplane in the air .

" <p> Harris said that pulling in the strengths of each participating agency will be important in the response going forward . <p> " The most important part of this , honestly , is the relationships we 've built , with each other and with the other agencies , " he said .

" On the days when I commanded the Shaldag combat unit in life-threatening operations on enemy soil , you , Netanyahu , worked your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While I trained generations of commanders and fighters , you took acting lessons in New York . " <p> Netanyahu reacted by saying that " Gantz should be ashamed of himself , " and reminded Israelis that he risked his life and nearly lost it during his IDF service . <p> Among Netanyahu 's worst attacks on Gantz , he mocked him at a conference of the right-wing newspaper Besheva that his rival had headed a cybersecurity firm but could not even stop his own phone from being hacked by the Iranians . <p> Now that the three campaigns are all over and an agreement on a government headed by Netanyahu and Gantz has finally been signed , Israelis will be closely watching the two of them to see if they can put their past battles behind them to serve the public . <p> Among the people who know both Netanyahu and Gantz very well , opinions are divided on whether that is even possible . <p> One former politician who has worked closely with both men said the partnership is doomed to failure , and might not even be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed by May 7 , the agreement Netanyahu and Gantz reached on Monday could still end up not resulting in a new government , and even if it does , Netanyahu can force an election at any time . <p> " This deal shows the total naivete of Gantz , " the former politician said . " Whoever knows Bibi well understands that he is manipulative and knows how to get what he needs . Had he gotten a right-wing government , it could have let him strangle the Knesset and trample the Supreme Court , but half the public would have been against him , and he would have had an assertive opposition . Now that he broke the Center-Left bloc , he gained legitimacy , which is even better for him . " <p> The former politician said Gantz , with only 15 loyal MKs and his lack of political experience , would not be able to stop anything Netanyahu wants to do . He said Gantz 's decision to join Netanyahu 's government after a standoff over the Knesset speaker post does not bode well for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominate the next chief of police and decide who the next Supreme Court judges will be , " he said . " This is crazy and would n't happen in any advanced democracy . Gantz won the election , got the mandate from the president , got backing from the Supreme Court against Netanyahu and former Knesset speaker Yuli Edelstein , and when the moment for action came , he gave in to Bibi 's empty gun . " <p> Contrasting Gantz and Netanyahu , the former politician called the former " a good IDF chief of staff and a man of substance who is inexperienced and naive , " and the latter " a man who has no dissonance in lying and could easily pass a lie detector test . " <p> SOURCES CLOSE to Netanyahu and Gantz who currently work closely with them downplayed the criticism of both men and said that regardless of what has happened in the past , they are now ready to work together for the good of all Israelis . <p> " There is obviously a certain amount of suspicion between the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe the suspicion will decrease , " said a senior Likud politician who is very close to the prime minister . <p> Sources in the Likud and Blue and White expressed confidence that the coalition agreement would prevent any attempt by their party leaders to undermine the other . <p> " There are many guarantees within the legislation to make sure it will be fulfilled , " the Likud politician said . " There are suspicions about Bibi , and that 's why there are guarantees to make sure it will be fulfilled . If he stabbed Gantz in the back , Gantz would be prime minister , and we would go to elections . " <p> " I disagree that he backstabs , " he said . " He is a clever politician . I do n't think he broke his promises . Those who receive promises understand that there are political realities that change . " <p> Asked if Netanyahu 's trial , which is set to start next month , or the annexation set for July could deteriorate the prime minister 's relationship with Gantz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial will start with the reading of the charges and then will have nothing substantive for many months , and applying sovereignty is part of the coalition agreement that Gantz accepted , and even if he opposes it and votes against it , it will move forward , " he said . <p> The Likud politician concluded by saying that " after a horrible year and three very tough election campaigns , it is obvious to Netanyahu that it is time to move on . " <p> The same was said by Blue and White MK and soon-to-be-minister Chili Tropper , a former Gantz adviser who is acknowledged to be the MK closest to him . <p> " Moving on to reconciliation will be the primary challenge for all of us to face , " Tropper said . " What got the leaders together after a year and a half of war was that they saw what the public expected of them . With the coronavirus , it was no longer legitimate to deal with petty politics . It was time to start getting along . " <p> Tropper also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gantz will work together professionally . He cited clauses that would make Gantz prime minister in a transition government , Blue and White 's veto power over bills , and the party 's control over the powerful Ministerial Committee on Legislation . <p> " The legislation is unprecedented , " Tropper said . " That is why all the comparisons to Mofaz and Livni are not serious . A team of lawyers worked on the bills for months . More importantly , Netanyahu and Gantz have been building trust , too , but that will take time . " <p> Tropper -- who helped write Gantz 's first campaign speeches , presumably including the attack on Netanyahu the night he was introduced as a Knesset candidate -- said the public should notice how differently Gantz spoke in his address about the coalition agreement on Tuesday night . <p> " Over the course of recent weeks , I 've spent dozens of hours in discussions and meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu , " Gantz said . " We arrived at agreements that will restore a functional government in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Netanyahu would jointly and responsibly manage the coronavirus , enable budgets to be passed and make sure that the justice system can operate soundly and freely . <p> " Jews , Druze , and Arabs , the ultra-Orthodox , religious and secular , women and men , all of Israel 's citizens deeply wish that we could work together to the benefit of all of us , particularly in these unusual times , and I expect all of the partners to our new government to enlist in the effort to better our country , " he said . <p> Gantz concluded his address by praising Netanyahu in a way that could not have happened during any of the campaigns . <p> " I 'd like to use this opportunity to thank all the partners who allowed us to take this step for the Israeli people -- including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who has also paid , and will continue to pay , a steep personal price for this move , " he said .

@@31835241 <p> In 126 tweets on Sunday , President Donald Trump offered scattershot commentary on a range of topics , including accusing former President Barack Obama of a crime . Here 's a check on some tweets from Sunday and Monday . ( Anna Moneymaker / The New York Times , file ) <p> It was Mother 's Day , but President Donald Trump mostly had other things on his mind . In a giant tweetstorm on Sunday -- 126 tweets , the third-highest daily total of his presidency , according to FactBa.se , a website that tracks Trump 's statements -- the president offered scattershot commentary on a range of topics . He accused former president Barack Obama of committing a crime ( i.e. , #ObamaGate ) , railed about the prosecution of his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic . <p> Most of Trump 's tweets were retweets by conservative commentators . A common theme is that somehow Obama manipulated the federal " deep state " bureaucracy to set Trump up to fail in his first weeks as president , resulting in the firing of Flynn . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters at a news conference on May 11 . " Some terrible things happened . . . and you 'll be seeing over the coming weeks . " But he refused to say what Obama did wrong , saying only , " You know what the crime is . " <p> Here 's a guide through some of the president 's tweets , including some from May 11 , the day after Mother 's Day , as Trump continued having an itchy Twitter finger . <p> -- -- -- <p> " Because it was OBAMAGATE , and he and Sleepy Joe led the charge . The most corrupt administration in U.S. history ! " -- ( Tweet , May 11 ) <p> Trump 's tweet here is over an article published in the Federalist , titled " Why Did Obama Tell The FBI To Hide Its Activities From The Trump Administration ? " The article , written by Margot Cleveland , argues that Obama directed top officials at the FBI and the Justice Department to withhold information from the incoming Trump administration about an investigation of Flynn . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-ranking officials to do likewise once the new president has taken office , " Cleveland writes . " Or , rather , the only excuse is an equally scandalous one : Obama knew the Russia investigation was a hoax from the get-go . " <p> Advertising <p> The Federalist , a conservative website with murky financial backing , has long argued that the Russia probe was a " hoax , " notwithstanding the numerous indictments , including of Russians , that resulted from the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller . Central to this narrative is a meeting held in the Oval Office on Jan. 5 , 2017 . Cleveland links to another Federalist article that alleges a series of leaks were engineered after the meeting " to sideline key law enforcement and intelligence officials and cripple the ability of the incoming Trump administration to run the country . " Coincidentally or not , a number of the articles cited were part of The Washington Post 's Pulitzer Prize-winning entry in national reporting , an accomplishment that Trump 's supporters have long tried to discredit . <p> The fallacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silver platter , doled out by scheming officials . The reality is that scoops in the national security realm almost always come about only after a reporter pulls at various threads , speaking to a variety of sources to figure out what is happening behind closed doors . It 's often like assembling a jigsaw puzzle . <p> " Typically , I got my best stories in small pieces from people I had cultivated for years or discovered through a common web of trust , each contributing part of a whole that none would tell me directly , " noted three-time Pulitzer Prize winner Barton Gellman . <h> Related <p> As for the Jan. 5 meeting , a key document cited is an email that then-national security adviser Susan Rice sent herself on Jan. 20 , 2017 . Rice wrote that Obama told participants that " as we engage with the incoming team , we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we can not share information fully as it relates to Russia . " Obama was aware of intercepts of conversations between Flynn and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctions imposed by Obama for Russian interference in the 2016 election . He asked then-FBI Director James Comey to inform him if anything changes that would affect the sharing of classified information , Rice 's email said . <p> An attorney for Rice said she wrote the email on the advice of White House counsel to create a permanent record of the conversation . " We were not informed by Director Comey or the Attorney General that there was an active investigation of anybody in the Trump orbit , " Rice told House investigators in an interview made public May 7 . " We would not have asked that question because , in the Obama White House , we maintained scrupulously the firewall between people in the White House and contacts with Justice about potential or actual criminal matters . " <p> These two retweets of articles from conservative media outlets offer a similar theme , with Flynn 's attorney claiming ( without evidence ) that the alleged conspiracy against Flynn went all the way up to Obama . The second article also claims that federal officials engaged in orchestrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Despite all of their scheming and calculating , the perjury trap failed miserably . Flynn told the truth " when he met with FBI agents asking about his conversations with Kislyak , the article claims . <p> Flynn , however , has acknowledged he lied . In pleading guilty , Flynn said : " I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong , and , through my faith in God , I am working to set things right . My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel 's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country . I accept full responsibility for my actions . " <p> Prosecutors said FBI agents gave Flynn multiple opportunities to correct his false statements during the interview . Flynn testified in 2018 that he knew it was a crime when he lied to the FBI . ( One unusual thing : At Comey 's direction , the FBI surprised top officials at the Justice Department by arranging the interview when the department was still considering whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Attorney General William Barr directed the Justice Department to drop the case against Flynn , in a filing that argued the investigation of Flynn 's calls was not justified . But a former top Justice Department official says Barr " twisted " her testimony to Mueller to make the case for dismissal . <p> The testimony " does not suggest that the F.B.I . had no counterintelligence reason for investigating Mr. Flynn , " Mary McCord , former acting assistant attorney general for national security , wrote in The New York Times . " It does not suggest that the F.B.I . ' s interview of Mr. Flynn -- which led to the false-statements charge -- was unlawful or unjustified . It does not support that Mr. Flynn 's false statements were not material . " <p> In her interview with Mueller 's team , McCord said that it had seemed " logical " to her for the Russians to have conversations with the incoming administration until she read the transcripts . " After reading them , she felt they were ' worse ' than she initially thought " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she thought it is hard to forget something you raised yourself in a conversation . <p> The Mueller report says that " with respect to the sanctions , Flynn requested that Russia not escalate the situation , not get into a ' tit for tat , ' and only respond to the sanctions in a reciprocal manner . " But the transcripts of Flynn 's calls have never been released . <p> -- -- -- <p> " Barack Hussain sic Obama is the first Ex-President to ever speak against his successor , which was long tradition of decorum and decency . Should anyone really be surprised ? " -- Tweet , May 10 <p> The claim that no president before Obama was ever critical of his successor is not correct . Here 's a sampling . <p> Bill Clinton , on George W. Bush , July 19 , 2007 : " The point is , that there is no military victory here . . . . There is no evidence that , whether we have a good day in a particular community or region in Iraq , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any diplomatic process that 's got a chance to help with the neighbors . " <p> Jimmy Carter , on Ronald Reagan , Nov. 10 , 1982 : " Most of the quite radical departures in foreign , domestic and economic policy have not been good for the country . We have an unprecedented number of people unemployed ; bankruptcies are the highest in years ; farm income is at the lowest level ever ; the deficits have never been so high , and so forth . " <p> Gerald Ford , on Jimmy Carter , April 17 , 1977 : " Mr. Carter 's anti-inflation program came in like a lion . It 's going out like a mouse . " <p> Trump made this bewildering claim on a day when covid-19 deaths in the United States climbed past 80,000 , an increase of about 27% over the total on the previous Monday .

@@31838541 <p> If ( like me ) you watched too much true crime TV in the 1990s , the Unsolved Mysteries theme is enough to spark some pleasingly bizarre memories -- of aliens , psychics , ghostly phenomena , and host Robert Stack , always there to insist that you ( yes , you ! ) might be able to help solve that night 's string of cases . <p> Advertisement <p> Unsolved Mysteries ran for over a decade -- often dipping back into its own library of hundreds of episodes to update earlier segments as the years went on -- and Stack was n't its only host ; a revived version that aired after Stack 's passing in 2003 starred Dennis Farina , and there 's been talk of a new version in the works . <p> Also , it 's worth noting that Unsolved Mysteries , which was structured around re-enactments and interviews with experts and witnesses , did n't only deal in paranormal subjects ; it also offered investigations into cold-case murders , long-lost relatives , fugitives from justice , and so on .

Share your ( yes , your ! ) favorites in the comments ! <h> 12 ) Yeti ( season 4 , episode 17 ) <p> In classic Unsolved Mysteries style , the saga of a late-1950s Yeti search party that traveled through the Himalayas is stitched into an episode that also contains far more serious tales -- like that of a recently reunited elderly couple searching for the baby they 'd been forced to give up for adoption decades prior . At any rate , the Yeti segment includes an interview with Peter Byrne , one of the members of that Himalayan expedition , who discovered mysteriously huge footprints on his initial visit -- and then , on a return trip , pilfered a finger from a " Yeti hand " on display in a mountain temple . <p> Advertisement <p> Back in the U.S. , tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called Unsolved Mysteries , Stack himself gives Abominable Snowman believers a shred of hope , reminding us that " it seems impossible , but ... we must remember , it was only 70 years ago that the Giant Panda of China was first observed in the wild by Western man .

The Bermuda Triangle thus became seared into the popular imagination as a mystically perilous region -- the planes and their alien-abducted pilots a plot point in Close Encounters of the Third Kind .

There are segments covering a coastal South Carolina ghost said to protect islanders from deadly hurricanes , the story of a stockbroker who was found dead after a vision quest ( or , more likely , a nervous breakdown of some kind ) in the Southwest desert , and a feature on a psychic named " Katie " whose story is so strange that Stack insists " you be the judge " of whether or not she 's for real . <p> Advertisement <p> Katie sees ghosts , has visions of crime scenes , that sort of thing .

In the aftermath , many residents came down with the same mysterious flu . Under analysis , the " perplexing precipitation " ( some choice Stack phrasing there ) proved to contain human white blood cells , but was otherwise unidentifiable ; what 's more , nobody could figure out how it got up in the sky in the first place . Was it human waste expelled from an airliner ? The FAA was able to rule that out . Was it , as many locals believed , a secret military test of some kind ? Per usual , Unsolved Mysteries does n't make an outright judgment call , but the editing suggests that " maybe we were biological experiments of some kind ?

We meet a man who discovered the charred remains of his father in 1986 , as well as a meter reader who was making his rounds back in 1966 and stumbled upon a pile of human ashes ( and , somehow , one lonely foot ) , and still seems quite unsettled by the memory . While Unsolved Mysteries itselfremains staunchly objective , the show does bring out a believer and a skeptic to weigh in separately -- and the word " crackpottery " is used by guess which guest . <h> 7 ) Chair of death ( season 10 , episode 10 ) <p> " More than 300 years ago , a condemned killer pronounced a curse on the seat as he was led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Busby was allowed to visit his favorite North Yorkshire pub , sit in his favorite chair , and guzzle a pint before heading to his execution .

These days , the macabre artifact is mounted on the wall of a nearby museum , placed too high for anyone to actually sit in ever again . As Stack reassures us , " Its killing days are presumed to be over . " <h> 6 ) Bigfoot ( season 1 , episode 18 ) <p> The Yeti got its own Unsolved Mysteries spotlight , as did Florida 's famed Skunk Ape , but the series also devoted multiple segments to different Sasquatch sightings over the years . The man-ape 's first appearance on the show came in season one , in a story involving " 12 reliable witnesses " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few shreds of evidence ( photographs of tracks in the snow , hair caught in a screen door ) collected in the Colorado mountains . <p> Advertisement <p> The re-enactments -- picture a hulking actor in a shaggy costume loping through the snow -- are probably more memorable than any of the actual findings , though that did n't curb the show 's enduring curiosity about the creature . In a season six episode , Unsolved Mysteries accompanies a group of Bigfoot enthusiasts ( including Peter Byrne , the finger bandit from the Yeti episode ) into the Pacific Northwest forest to check out reports of recent encounters . " Even hoaxes are usually based on something , " Stack declares , but anything that could constitute proof remains elusive by the end of the segment . <h> 5 ) Mary Celeste ( season 7 , episode 7 ) <p> Any series purporting to investigate the unknown must have a ghost ship , and there 's no more fascinating tale in that realm than the saga of Mary Celeste .

But all told , Stack reminds us , " the secret of the Mary Celeste remains to this day a tantalizing unsolved mystery .

The re-enactments are particularly striking in this one , with a spectacularly glowing ghost in a flowing gown , and even though Stack warns against picking up hitchhikers around the cemetery , all the interviewees who claim to have seen Mary in the wild seem way more thrilled than terrified . <p> Advertisement <h> 2 ) Coral Polge ( season 3 , episode 11 ) <p> Unsolved Mysteries often covers similar subject matter from episode to episode , whether it 's reuniting estranged families or charting alien abductions . But once in awhile the show finds a totally unique topic , as in the case of " psychic artist " Coral Polge . To put it simply : She draws dead people . As she explains it , it 's an ability that blends intuition with a sort of spin on automatic writing , and -- as side-by-side photos of the deceased and Polge 's drawings show -- sometimes she 's alarmingly accurate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of course , Unsolved Mysteries is going to highlight her greatest successes out of " 100,000 eerie portraits , " as Stack calls them . But however she does it , it 's downright uncanny . <h> 1 ) " Rainboy " ( season 5 , episode 18 ) <p> After the death of his abusive grandfather , 21-year-old Don Decker apparently gained the ability to manifest something like a rainstorm -- indoors . The rain began at a house belonging to his friends , then somehow followed the group across the street to a pizza restaurant , then Don started levitating , bleeding from spontaneous claw marks , screaming " it burns ! " at a rosary , and generally acting possessed . Among several witnesses , the police officers present were divided on what they 'd seen , but when Don started making it rain inside the local jail , a priest was summoned to take care of what everyone had decided by then was some kind of demonic situation . <p> Advertisement <p> This entire segment has so many facets of WTF -- seriously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so specifically freakish ? -- but Stack , ever the classy host , has just the right speech on hand to put us even further over the edge : " As John Milton wrote in Paradise Lost , the mind is its own place , and in itself can make a heaven of hell , a hell of heaven .

As the pandemic 's grip on Columbia stretches past a month and into the indeterminate future , restaurants are grappling with an imperfect and necessary federal assistance program , middling take-out sales and the prospects of what a potential reopening may look like . <p> How -- and how many -- local restaurants will make it through this is a question that 's weighing heavily on the Columbia business community , and the answers are far from definite . <p> Glimpsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its memories . <p> John Carlos <h> Rock and a Hard Place <p> In South Carolina , where leisure and hospitality makes up 12 percent of jobs , the pandemic wrought heavy economic damage . <p> Per data estimates from the National Restaurant Association and the American Hotel and Lodging Association , South Carolina has lost 179,853 jobs in the hospitality sector -- 156,000 from restaurants and 23,853 from lodging . Revenue data is still unavailable for lodging businesses , yet it 's expected that the state will lose $740 million in revenue from restaurants . Overall tourism revenues in the state are projected to land 50 percent below what was expected for the year . <p> Small , independent restaurants are particularly vulnerable to the pandemic for several reasons , explains Robin DiPietro , who shared the economic data with Free Times . <p> The USC professor and director of the International Institute for Foodservice Research and Education points to the perishable inventory that eateries were saddled with when the pandemic started , materials that are bought and paid for and now extremely difficult to cook and sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finances and logistics of a takeout model work for many restaurants . <p> " Not all restaurants can have delivery or takeout , it does n't translate , " DiPietro elaborates . <p> Despite that , restaurants throughout the city have been forced to give takeout a try -- the results have been mixed and a far cry from typical sales . Attempts range from retail sales of wine , beer or house-made sauces , to family-style meals and take-and-bake options . <p> And local restaurants are in worse positions compared to corporate chains , which have more financial depth to fortify them against current conditions . <p> " You have an independent business owner that might work with their two children and two employees and those people are out of jobs , " DiPietro elaborates . <p> It 's critical for these businesses that the industry comes back online , for the sake of jobs . But that imperative flies against the precautions many health experts say are still necessary to slow COVID-19 's spread . <p> DiPietro says reopening needs to start being strategized , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empty Dining Rooms <p> A drive down Harden Street into the Five Points shows a decidedly different atmosphere than normal -- less traffic , less people and less restaurants open . <p> Patios at typically hopping restaurants like Home Team BBQ lay dormant , unable to take advantage of spring 's shift away from the winter . At the outpost of the burger-and-shake chain Cookout , one can peer through the glass and see a dining room stacked with outdoor patio furniture . Along Saluda Avenue , where a host of restaurants and businesses reside , the often headache-inducing parking situation is suddenly easy , with ample empty spaces available . <p> Just as Columbia 's hospitality scene should be coming alive , coronavirus has all but shut it down . <p> An April 16 poll of restaurant owners done by the Independent Restaurant Coalition , a restaurant advocacy group , and the James Beard Foundation paints the situation in bleak terms . The poll asked owners how much longer they can survive . Twenty-eight percent of restaurants in cities with mandatory closures said they do n't believe they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent said they believe they can only survive up to two months of closures . <p> Outside of Columbia , the industry seems to agree that , despite how bad things may be , public health needs to be a top priority . <p> In Georgia , Gov . Brian Kemp decided to allow restaurants to reopen under certain restrictions on April 27 and the Republican governor faced steep criticism . Many restaurant owners declared they would n't re-open , citing that it was far too early . <p> While a date to re-open is undetermined in South Carolina , the wheels are beginning to turn . On April 20 , McMaster launched the accelerateSC task force , which aims to " consider and recommend economic revitalization plans for South Carolina " as public health allows . <p> Bobby Williams , CEO and chairman of the local Southern food chain Lizard 's Thicket and chairman of the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association , is on that task force and tells Free Times he wants to see restaurants be able to reopen in mid-May under very specific health guidelines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases were on the downswing in South Carolina , it provides restaurant suppliers enough time to restock and allows restaurants to prepare . <p> " We would like to open the same way we closed , " he says . " We will open at reduced seating and slowly but surely get back to normal , but it might be a couple of months before we get back to normal . " <p> If that call to reopen came in South Carolina it would be a welcome one , owners say , but it would require sufficient testing capabilities and new coronavirus cases in significant decline . <p> " I would love it , if that could happen , but I do n't think setting a date at this point , for me , to open is realistic , " says Tim Gardner , owner of Main Street 's Lula Drake Wine Parlour . " For me , it 's not a question . I get the economics -- look , I 'm a small business owner . I have to make a living . However , I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictate when this is going to be over or safe . " <p> Porter Barron , owner of Cottontown 's Midlands-focused Southern restaurant The War Mouth , echoes much of Gardner 's sentiments . He says without prevalent testing he ca n't imagine opening . That comes as the restaurant is n't making enough to cover rent or afford much of its overhead . But it has been able to defer some of those expenses . <p> " I 'll say very generally we could see us going a few more weeks or months , but we need more reassurances , " Barron offers , before pausing and continuing : " Where are the damn tests ? " <p> But if opening comes at 50 percent capacity , both Kristian Niemi , owner of the popular restaurants Bourbon and Black Rooster , and Gardner are uncertain how helpful that 'd actually be . Gardner points to his 49 seat capacity being cut to around 24 and says " there 's just no way " it would work . <p> Niemi and his team have been running various scenarios at 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to make that work financially , but acknowledges they 'd still likely reopen . <p> " When you 're already talking about businesses that run 5 to 10 percent profit margin , now you 're going to cut the revenue in half ... it far outweighs everything you can handle , " he explains . <p> DiPietro , the USC professor , has helped build a set of health and sanitation guidelines , based on other states ' measures and her expertise , for the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association to illustrate what best practices might look like if restaurants reopen . These were delivered as part of Williams ' opening proposal to the governor on Friday . <p> DiPietro details that it will likely include re-cleaning and re-sanitizing at regular intervals , providing employees with protective equipment like masks and gloves , single-use paper towels , readily available hand sanitizer , no refillable drinks and more . <p> " Restaurants have always been good at food safety issues , but this is even protecting ourselves from ourselves , " DePietro shares . " We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolishly . " <p> The decision to reopen and the timing is out of her hands , she stresses , and points to the governor 's office for that decision . <p> " It 's such a fine line , is n't it ? " she says . <p> Williams says whether the governor is receptive to the idea of opening in May remains to be seen . He emphasizes that if the state is n't ready to make the move due to public health concerns , he 'd understand . <p> " You know what , if it is too soon , we will have to wait another two weeks . This is bigger than that " Williams says . " We 've already lost enough money , if we have to wait another two weeks it wo n't make a difference . If we got to wait until June for the public to feel comfortable to come in , that 's just a bottom line . " <p> Lula Drake Wine Parlour tried takeout for a time in response to COVID-19 , but eventually gave it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , as COVID-19 spread throughout China and began to make international news , Lula Drake Wine Parlour owner Gardner was having dinner with his wife at home . The two were watching the news and he recalls the moment vividly . <p> " I looked at her and said , ' This is going to change everything , ' " he retells . <p> In the weeks that followed , the virus surged in Italy . Gardner , an asthmatic , called his tight-knit staff together for an impromptu meeting . He took a serious tone . <p> " ' I 'm not trying to be Mr. Doomsday , but this is huge , ' " he recalls telling them . <p> Gardner recommended they begin to save their money and that they avoid going out . When the virus did begin to spread in Columbia , Lula Drake was one of the first businesses to close its dining room . <p> Gardner temporarily closed the wine bar on March 15 , two days before McMaster 's order officially came down , to prepare a takeout operation . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine and beer , and selling food , too . Nine days later , he decided conditions were growing too severe to justify staying open , and he shuttered the entire business temporarily -- though he continues to offer rare wines in a " cellar sale " through social media . <p> Restaurant owners were given forewarning with the conditions in Seattle and San Francisco , places with some of the earliest outbreaks in the country , says Bourbon and Black Rooster 's Niemi . <p> " If this did catch you off guard , it 's because you were barely paying attention , " he posits . <p> He says he began preparing his restaurants early on and put some money away to try and insulate them . But despite thinking ahead , they 're still bleeding money . <p> And for many , the only way to try and stem the losses is to pivot to takeout . Niemi gave takeout a shot for about two weeks and says it was n't feasible for him and that he found it unsafe as the virus continued to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did takeout for a while over at Black Rooster and it just does n't make enough money to warrant doing it . It does n't even cover costs , " Niemi says . <p> Gardner says that takeout was ultimately unsustainable for his business model , and Barnes says Yesterdays ' sales were roughly cut in half when it lost dine-in service . <p> For some , the move has forced them to adapt quickly . <p> Barron , the War Mouth co-owner , says the restaurant had little online presence before the pandemic and focused mostly on sharing posts through its Facebook page . Once the pandemic hit , it rushed to put together a website with an online ordering system . <p> He says it found some success in selling family-style meals , like mac and cheese , and casseroles of smoked pork or squash . <p> " Those things right now are really moving for us , " Barron shares . " It 's funny , we 're trying to remind ourselves that we 're not a restaurant anymore , we 're trying to hang on so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kristian Niemi closes up shop at his Main Street restaurant Bourbon back in March . <p> Thomas Hammond <h> Federal Funds <p> While restaurants have shuffled to try their hands at takeout , owners are also pursuing federal assistance through the CARE Act and its Paycheck Protection Program . <p> But some small restaurant owners in Columbia have yet to receive any of the initial $349 billion in funding . The initial funding ran out on April 16 , just 14 days after the program launched , and Congress did n't refund the program again until April 21 . <p> On its face , the PPP seems like a godsend for restaurants . It provides federally backed eight-week loans to help rehire or retain employees , and if 75 percent is used on payroll costs , the loan is completely forgiven . But the details get complicated , drawing criticism from the hospitality industry . <p> The loan requires businesses to use it within eight weeks of receipt , but restaurants may not be able to reopen in time for that to be useful . <p> And Niemi suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program may be even more ineffective . He says that it 's a situation where the amount of staff needed to man his businesses would drop in half , negating some of the hiring the PPP allows . <p> " Say we get it two weeks before we 're allowed to open , we could literally get people back in the business , get everybody trained , " he hypothesizes . " However , this is the big ' but ' : ... At the end of those eight weeks , if we were still operating at 50 percent capacity , I 'll have to lay those people off . " <p> The Independent Restaurant Coalition , with supporters in Columbia and key founders in Charleston , is lobbying for updates to the program that would better fit restaurants . It 's asking for Congress to extend the maximum loan term to three months , make the origination date of the funds the first day restaurants can legally open fully and to increase the repayment time to 10 years from two . <p> Beyond that , the loan has faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shake Shack and Ruth Chris 's , which has a Columbia location in the Vista , received large chunks of the funding and , per The Wall Street Journal , other publicly traded companies have received money , too . <p> Williams says Lizard 's Thicket received its PPP loan and that business at his restaurants has jumped about 10 percent since citizens began receiving recent direct stimulus checks from the federal government . He adds that despite concerns , the PPP should still be palatable , even if restaurants ca n't hit the criteria to make the dispensations forgivable , saying it transforms into a 1 percent interest loan . <p> " You ca n't get a one percent loan anywhere , " he states . <p> But Williams also acknowledges that the restaurant industry needs to -- and is -- advocating the federal government to update the timeframe for repaying it . <p> Despite the concerns and criticisms lobbed at the program , Gardner says that he is n't in a position to avoid the money . <p> " We need the money , but the language is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to help us , " he posits . " I 'm trying to do everything that I can to increase my chances of survival ... I think it 's foolish to not pursue anything that you can , because no one knows how all this is going to work .

@@31841441 <p> For starters , one of you was kind enough to point out that my plan to read about 40 pages a week over eight weeks amounted to roughly 320 pages -- y'know , HALF of " Moby-Dick . " Suffice to say , there are reasons I 'm a writer and not a numbers person . Sorry . So if this works and you all enjoy it , it 'll run more like 16 weeks . I also realized quickly doing readings by pages made little sense since editions are paginated differently . So this week , we are looking at Chapters 1-7 . Next week , we 'll discuss Chapters 8-16 . <p> Also , the first video chat did n't quite go as planned . I grossly underestimated how much Zoom time to book for the discussion with Flynn . <p> We touched on the Etymology and Extracts and a few opening chapters but not all seven that we 'd planned to discuss . <p> We may try to fold some of them into the next chat without creating such a long video as to burden those of you who are following . <p> Also because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address our first reader query . Reader Kathryn expressed her affinity for books with extreme adventure , from " The Hobbit " to " The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . " She made an intriguing comparison between characters in " The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn " and " Moby-Dick " -- how both Huck and Ishmael " are aware of the social attitudes about characters like Queequeg and Jim , but they are both open-minded and non-judgemental in the end . " <p> She wondered if Twain and Melville had any interaction or expressions of admiration for one another 's work . And she had another query about Melville 's subtle use of humor , and thought the " use of names to evoke the characters " reminded her of Dickens ' work . <p> So first , thanks to Kathryn for our first query , which I 'll address as two separate entries that -- I hope -- end up twisting together . <p> I checked " Autobiography of Mark Twain : The " but found no reference to Melville . That said , the book also bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book does n't necessarily mean anything . But it does bring up the well-documented connection between Hawthorne and Melville . Hawthorne was 15 years Melville 's elder . Roughly 10 years separates their first significant published works . But Melville met Hawthorne in 1850 and exhibited a extravagant devotion for the writer he said , " Dropped germinous seeds into my soul . " " Moby-Dick " was published a little more than a year later , so those were quite some seeds . Notable , also : The book is dedicated to Hawthorne . <p> Hawthorne saw something critics and readers did n't . He wrote admiringly of " Moby-Dick , " but the book was n't as well regarded as it has become in the years since . It sold poorly during Melville 's lifetime . <p> Twain would 've been a teenager when the book was published . His " The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County " short story was published in 1865 , 14 years after " Moby-Dick . " But Twain 's renown blossomed as Melville 's turned cold . <p> That said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor . There exists a belief among some readers that Melville 's work was humorless , but on the contrary , I find humor flecked -- not laced , but flecked -- throughout the book . We encounter it in our first seven chapters , particularly as Ishmael argues with himself about how to spend a night , whether to bunk up with a harpooner he 's not seen . Ishmael does n't revel in the comedy of his sleeping situation , but these pages do play out with a certain comedic rhythm as he endures and later reflects upon Queequeg " on the whole " as " a clean , comely-looking cannibal . " <p> The accompanying video includes a little discussion about Melville 's sense of humor . We also touch on the seemingly endless metaphors for death throughout the book starting early and continuing through to its end . We have an innkeeper named Coffin . We have a visit to an African-American church , where Melville/Ishmael lay it on thick with " a black Angel of Doom " in the pulpit whose text is " about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , our era : The book was published in 1851 . I do n't recall a specific time indicator within these first seven chapters other than the marble tablets in Chapter 7 . The most recent of them dedicated to the six men killed on The Ship Eliza who were " towed out of sight by a Whale " on Dec. 31 , 1839 , which I believe is about a year before Melville 's first major trip to sea . <p> We should n't get ahead of ourselves , though ... <p> In the video we touch on the first page of " Moby-Dick . " Flynn reads from a compressed re-done version of the book designed likely for a young reader . It implies our narrator takes to the sea out of a sense of adventure . I 'd love to hear your thoughts on this , as the first paragraph sounds instead to me like a description of depression , and a rudderless Ishmael throwing himself into this story not out of restlessness , but because of some darker impulse : <p> " Whenever I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a damp , drizzly November in my soul ; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses , and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet ; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me , that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street , and methodically knocking people 's hats off -- then , I account it high time to get to the sea as soon as I can . " <p> Doubling back to Kathryn 's email : I read an account that suggested Melville began dark and arced toward a brighter tone , whereas Twain 's career started with a lighter tone and then arced toward darker writing . <p> I just do n't see that arc in Melville 's work . He enjoyed some success , wrote his opus , which hit the shore like a dead whale -- large and unwanted . I believe the figure sits at about 3,000 copies sold during his lifetime . His work that followed was regarded with even less enthusiasm . He dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's star was rising , Melville was dealing with a stalled career , a dead son and big questions of faith . <p> So I feel nearly certain the two did n't cross paths physically or even via correspondence . I feel like correspondence would 've been made public . Which leaves the vaporous notion of influence . And here , I 'll direct you to the video . Flynn discusses the format of the book and how it influenced his memoir , " Another ( Expletive ) Night in Suck City . " Flynn 's commentary in our conversation shows just how broad a writer 's influence can be on another . I 'll try not to paraphrase him here : There 's no point since you can hear him talk about it in the video . But when he was struggling to find a format for his story , he found inspiration in Melville 's novel : Its short chapters ; its diverse tonal forms within the short chapters , some of which in " Moby-Dick " are driven by events , some are driven by history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Twain were n't separated by that many years -- in fact , roughly the same number that separated Melville from Hawthorne -- and were writers familiar with traversing bodies of water . I 'd say Twain 's work drew from folklore and Melville 's more from mythology . Both knew their way around a good allegory . And I do think both had a working sense of humor , but Melville 's feels rarer to me . <p> And I think that question is a good point of entry into our first week of reading . Because some of the humor is here , particularly as our narrator bumbles his way toward this adventure , finding a most unlikely roommate . <p> It starts almost with an incantation ( more on this in the video ) . Or a request for an audience . " God will hear " . . . that 's the origin of " Ishmael . " <p> The first sentence -- " Call me Ishmael. " -- is among the most famous ever penned . We discuss it some in the video . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> I feel like I may have short-changed some of the later chapters from this first block of text .

@@31841541 <h> Share this story <h> ShareAll sharing options for:The post-disaster artist <p> On Aug. 7 , 2015 , hours before his $150 million comic book reboot Fantastic Four opened on 3,995 North American screens , director Josh Trank smashed the self-destruct button . " A year ago I had a fantastic version of this , " he tweeted in blind rage . " And it would 've recieved sic great reviews . You 'll probably never see it . That 's reality though . " <p> Provoked by a review suggesting that Fantastic Four be " studied in film schools as an example of what not to do , " the writer-director fired off 138 vicious characters without so much as a reread to catch his typo . The responses were immediate . He had champions who praised the gall it took to slap back against The Man , and detractors who thought the whole episode was maybe a little gauche . Drowning in a sea of notifications , Trank finally picked up the phone when his manager called . <p> " He was afraid of what was gon na happen to me , " Trank told me of the dizzying moment . " I was messing with one of the most powerful corporations in the world . " <p> Trank was the obvious candidate to reinvigorate Fantastic Four for 20th Century Fox . In 2010 , the studio plucked the then-26-year-old filmmaker from obscurity to direct the microbudgeted Chronicle . The story of three high schoolers who gain , and are torn apart by , superhuman power gave Trank the chance to rewire the " found footage " style with untethered psychic velocity . Critical praise , combined with a new title -- the youngest person ever to open a movie at No. 1 at the box office -- imbued the filmmaker with the aura of an action auteur . When Chronicle finished its theatrical run with a $123 million worldwide gross , studios scrambled to tap Trank 's energy . Sony attached him to the Spider-Man-adjacent Venom ; Warner Bros. wanted him for the spy thriller Red Star ; he worked to adapt the beloved video game Shadow of the Colossus ; he got a Star Wars movie . At the top of his world , Trank quit drinking , bought a car , and met the love of his life , whom he married six months later . <p> The race to book Trank ended in late 2012 with an offer from Fox to direct Fantastic Four . In the mid-2000s , a pair of lighthearted Fantastic Four films led by Jessica Alba and Chris Evans failed to break through in a zeitgeist captured by Christopher Nolan 's gritty reinvention of Batman . Fox hoped that a modern sensibility could take the property in a new direction , despite veterans like I Am Legend writer Akiva Goldsman and the team behind 2011 's Thor being unable to make it work . Trank voiced his interest , and though Fox executives offered him the chance to pursue something original , the Marvel movie " felt like the most rebellious thing to do , " the director said . His take on the material made him confident . A company buying into his hype made him bullheaded . Fox did n't want to make another Fantastic Four movie -- it wanted to make Josh Trank 's Fantastic Four movie . <p> The movie was a multitiered bomb . On top of critical pans and a worldwide gross of $167 million , just a third of what the first Fantastic Four made 10 years earlier , the lead-up and fallout of the film saw Trank caught in behind-the-scenes drama . Insiders told The Hollywood Reporter at the time that the director had been erratic , reclusive , and absent-minded enough to allow his three dogs to do $100,000 worth of damage to the Louisiana home rented for the shoot . The first time I spoke to Trank , eight months after the release of Fantastic Four , he pushed back on the details in the report . His disposition was harder to defend . " There have been a lot of times when I 've been told , ' This is how you should handle this , ' and I handle it in a different way and it turns out in my favor , " he said . " And then there have also been times when I 've been wrong , and it has only resulted in complete disaster . " <p> Trank 's tweet , a last-ditch effort to shape history in his favor , made him a bigger target . Headlines from The Daily Beast to Defamer and every geek blog under the sun aggregated his words as more gossip thickened the plot . The public autopsy sent the director into hiding . In the silence , he spiraled . Fury smoldered into numbness . His relationship was dissolving . Days liquefied into weeks , then months . For some reason , he looked at what people on Twitter had to say . " I felt dead inside , " he said . <p> Novelist John le Carr ? once called moviemaking " the enforced bonding of irreconcilable opposites . " Unlike painting or songwriting , cin ? ma often begins with a 120-page script in need of someone else 's money . In the mainstream lane , the money comes with a promise of story notes , waiting games , phone calls about " likability , " economic debates , actor concerns , union laws , scheduling issues , and post-production pipelines . A director becomes the CEO of a miniature corporation , and creativity is just one of the managerial subtasks . The job demands relentless ambition , but not so much as to threaten the disparate end goals of those supplying the cash . There are fights , depending on what 's worth fighting for , and reasons to back down , just to get it all done on time . As one studio executive put it to me , victories in the movie business are often validated by chance . A handle on emotion , in the end , has as much to do with survival and longevity as knowing where to put the camera . <p> On May 12 , Trank returns with Capone , the story of the Prohibition gangster 's final days intended as a new beginning for the 36-year-old director . Written in the irradiated remains of Trank 's career , the film finds The Revenant star Tom Hardy grunting , hissing , and shitting his way through an impressionistic death march . On the page , Capone reads more like Twin Peaks than Scarface . The final cut is , in Trank 's words , such a " pure and truthful and shocking " distillation of his own being that he regards it as his real " first movie . " The self-seriousness faded away on set ; on a brisk spring night in 2018 , I watched the director , in full period clothing , run out to a Louisiana marsh to rework a scene with cinematographer Peter Deming that only had a few hours to shoot before the sun set . Later , we stood on a knoll to watch an edited sequence loaded on his iPhone , in which Capone chases a flock of kids around the yard to the docile tones of " Nessun Dorma . " " Is n't this amazing ? " he asked , beaming . <p> " If Josh Trank is not in Movie Jail , " one critic tweeted after the announcement of Capone , " does Movie Jail even exist anymore ? " Trank does n't believe it does . Hollywood has sentenced directors to careers in TV or general obscurity , but to Trank , escaping the metaphorical lockup is about writing and directing one 's way out of it , doing the work . There 's undeniable privilege to the perspective , considering the struggle marginalized groups face in breaking into the industry , yet little to argue with , logically -- the best way to get a movie made , if all you want to do in the world is make movies , is to write a movie to make and go get it made . <p> I spoke to Trank off and on for four years as he reeled from Fantastic Four and set out to make Capone . And while he sidestepped Movie Jail , there may be no escape from the larger requirements of the industry and his own personal hang-ups . There are costs to every step of the process , and some personalities are more susceptible than others . <p> " Whatever I 'm sacrificing just has to be sacrificed , " he said . " It 's worth it for me ... I 'm just here to do this . " <p> In the spring of 2017 , with Fantastic Four behind him and Capone on the horizon , I met the filmmaker at his temporary home : a two-bedroom apartment in Santa Monica , California , kept up like a college dorm room . Outfitted with inflatable beds , an enormous television wired with an Xbox One , enough mac and cheese to fill a doomsday bunker , and a makeshift editing suite , the only signs of thriving life beyond the walls were the faint sounds of boardwalk crowds and ocean waves coming in from the porch door . For Trank , his assistant John , and Trank 's Boston Terrier Eugene , this was where the magic happened . If they were n't sniping 12-year-olds ' digital avatars in endless rounds of first-person shooters , they were building a storyboard animatic for Capone . Trank was not one for scenery ; he never left home , he said , preferring to work through the days and nights . He did n't have much of a social life , unless buying replacement cartridges for his vaporizer counted . <p> Trank on the set of Fantastic Four.Photo : AF archive/Alamy Stock Photo via Polygon <p> " I 'd say if you have five good friends , you 're good -- and I have five good friends . Do I see them often ? No . But it 's been a struggle for me because it is depressing . My obsessiveness rules out everything . I do n't really know how to date . I do n't know how to do anything like that . The relationships that I get into are more like , just really intense and straightforward . And I do n't know any middle ground in terms of just , like , living life . One day I hope to . " <p> In our early phone calls , Trank spoke with the cadence of a hyperventilating man on the run . Nondisclosure agreements turned his immediate past into a minefield , and though there was plenty to say about what brought him to this moment , " omert ? , " the mob slang for a code of silence , was dropped on more than one occasion in reference to his work on Fantastic Four . But even in person , soothed by deep inhales of strawberry-scented mist , the filmmaker spoke at a clip . Trank is absolutely the adult version of his disaffected , Vans-wearing , Liberty-spikes-sporting , NOFX-adoring teen self ( " People will argue , ' NOFX is n't real punk rock , ' to which I would say , ' Fuck you ' " ) , yet he 's a natural showman . At every turn , the director has a tangent or a theory or 100,000 words on HBO 's Generation Kill that made sense of the bizarre industry he chose to endure . As we sunk into his black leather furniture , Trank swerved from a treatise on the Coen brothers ' A Serious Man to a rundown of every movie blogger who ever dragged him on Twitter . His tone was extreme yet polite as he spun in a constant state of Extremely Online galaxy brain . " I could probably be on medications for my obsessions and my OCDs , but at the end of the day , like , it drives me , " he said . " I do n't want to be the guy to make the movie that somebody 10 years from now goes , ' You know what , that was a pretty good movie , but we could remake that . ' I do n't ever want to have a movie remade . " <p> Born Feb. 19 , 1984 , Trank grew up a lifelong Los Angeleno in the shadow of the studios . His schoolteacher mother and Holocaust documentarian father settled him and his younger sister in Culver City , with no ambitions to break into the business . Hollywood still enveloped them ; Trank 's earliest memory is of playing by a lake near his grandparents ' house , known to MGM backlot employees as the man-made lagoon constructed for movies like 1981 's Tarzan , the Ape Man . On a guided tour of his old stomping grounds , Trank giddily pointed out his childhood hangouts , go-to restaurants , and , in an ironic twist , the Fox studio lot in Century City , a landmark just off the course from his childhood home to high school . He drove by it every week . <p> Trank can name his formative favorites -- Edward Scissorhands , Star Wars , Fargo , and the left-field Truffaut films his dad would slip into the mix -- but has a deeper sense of how his own memories have shaped him . He vividly recalled watching from his doorstep as the National Guard marched down the street toward the Rodney King riots . The 1994 Los Angeles earthquake decimated his family 's home , leaving the Tranks in debt for years . When he was 12 , an older counselor at sleepaway camp " felt up my bitch tits , " and left him painstakingly aware of his own weight through his teen years . When he was 13 , his parents split up after their fights reached a vicious , logical endpoint . His mother 's new ZIP code afforded him a spot at Beverly Hills High , where he slacked and developed a chip on his shoulder over his classmates ' wealth . " I got my shoes at Payless , " he said . " When you 're at a friend 's house and they have , like , every fucking Air Jordan , it shocks you . You feel like a loser . " <p> When Trank was 14 , his dad struck up a relationship with Judy Toll , a veteran of The Groundlings with a reputation for cracking up the comedy world . Toll regularly sang karaoke with pals like Kathy Griffin and Jon Lovitz , and while the introverted Trank thought it was " the dorkiest , lamest thing in the world , " he felt the pull of performing . " Part of me deep down really , really , secretly wanted to just get out there and shut the house down . " When Toll discovered that her future stepkid did a dead ringer Louis Armstrong impression , the act was locked . The two sang " Let 's Call the Whole Thing Off " in front of a crowd of Toll 's pals , and Trank " never turned back from that . Like that chant , that experience , changed me . I shut the house down with Judy . " Toll went on to marry Trank 's father in the early 2000s , but a few years later , died of skin cancer . " I think about her still , like , every day , and I miss her tremendously . " <p> Trank fed his love of film with a steady diet of video rentals and Rolling Stone profiles . By the time he graduated high school , he not only admired the legends of the 1960s and ' 70s , but saw himself working within and against the system like they did . Terry Gilliam 's well-documented battle for final cut over the 1985 film Brazil was " for me , as a young rebellious teenager , was like a war cry in my head , " Trank said . " That 's how radicalized I had to be if I 'm going to take my shit as seriously as somebody like him . " He was also a millennial coming up in the age of middle-class privilege and overnight success . The culture that produced Mark Zuckerberg also convinced Trank to give himself a near-impossible task that would keep him up at night . After he graduated from high school , he had one goal : to beat Steven Spielberg 's legacy . <p> " I wanted to go make my dreams come true , " he said . " So I made a deal with my parents that if I did n't get my first movie by the time I was 27 , that I would quit . And the reason I picked 27 is because that 's when Spielberg started working on Jaws . I felt like if I could n't get it at that age , then I 'd probably be really depressed or something and then move on . " <p> Formal training was not in the cards for the reluctant student . After two and a half semesters at Brooks Institute of Photography , Trank ducked out to write scripts , schlep from guest room to guest room , and pick up work running 35mm dailies to labs . He told his parents he had a backup plan if he came up short . He did not have a backup plan . And as he insisted in our long car ride down memory lane , he refused to ask for help . <p> Trank worked menial film jobs early on ; he did know people . After befriending Clueless director Amy Heckerling 's daughter in high school , he worked a short stint as the director 's assistant at the age of 18 . Through Toll , he became close acquaintances with Arrested Development producer Jim Valley -- and an occasional occupant of Vallely 's couch . ( Trank would later cameo on Arrested Development , serving Tobias a lawsuit over the rights to a Fantastic Four musical . ) Through Vallely , Trank became an active participant in the storytelling comedy show Sit ' n Spin , and in the mid-2000s , he met and briefly dated one of the group 's most active members : Six Feet Under writer and future Transparent creator Jill Soloway . Trank 's brush with LA professionals gave him the confidence of a storyteller . The Sit ' n Spin stage turned his dark memories into crowd-pleasers , and gave the young Jewish man a reason to dress up as Hitler at least once . <p> But the actual work was menial , with most of his early 20s spent on production assistant work and futzing around with his computer on lessons like " How to Make a Lightsaber in Adobe After Effects . " Naturally , Trank found a reason to make a lightsaber in Adobe After Effects : Shot in his friend 's apartment in Echo Park for $100 , the clickbaity " Stabbing at Leia 's ( Uncensored ) " finds a beer-soaked college rager interrupted by the accidental ignition of a light sword . One minute later , a squad of stormtroopers arrives to break up the mess . Trank edited the video in a day , then posted it on YouTube . " No one watched it , " he said . Glued to the view count , Trank shot an IM to a friend clued in to the 4chan scene , hoping they 'd seed the video into the community . Without instant results , Trank finally went to sleep . <p> " To this day , nothing was as surreal as the feeling of when I woke up the next morning and had 100 emails in my inbox , " he said . " It had racked up 300,000 views . It went viral . It was on the front page on Yahoo . It was fucking crazy . " <p> Paramount Pictures . Warner Bros . MTV . All the emails were the same : " Are you in LA ? " Trank took his first professional meeting at the age of 22 , and a few days later , wound up with a contract at Spike TV to write , direct , and edit a webseries spinoff of John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg 's bank heist thriller The Kill Point . The network flew Trank to New York with a budget of $50,000 and a request for 30 pages of material . He had meager goals going into the project : " All I wanted was to do a dolly shot . " By the wrap of production , he had directed dolly shots and blown stuff up . <p> After The Kill Point aired in 2007 , Trank had the kind of high-gloss reel that every film school graduate would burn Citizen Kane print negatives to have their name on . Except his name was n't on them ; to exploit loopholes and avoid union issues , Spike TV ran Trank 's webisodes without credits , considering the videos to be more like commercials than spinoff content . ( A few months later , the Writer 's Guild of America would strike for 14 weeks over contract clauses that would directly address the future of streaming royalties and the shady limbo of web content ) . The Kill Point shorts prompted The Wrestler writer Robert Siegel to hire Trank to help produce and edit his low-budget directorial debut Big Fan , but when the tiny indie wrapped , the next assignment was n't there . <p> As cash dwindled , Trank moved back to Los Angeles and inundated himself with work , using any leftover oxygen to tap away at his own scripts . He spliced together cinematographer reels for cash . He edited an HBO documentary on sportscaster Marty Glickman . He sold and shot a Fox TV web pilot called McVenge , about a Dirty Harry-like cop whose reckless abandonment has put him on permanent suspension . None of it went anywhere , and the clock was ticking . " I knew I needed to be making one of these movies by the time I was 27 , or I was fucked . So I needed to be like , ' I die if this does n't happen . ' It was all I thought about day and night , and my 20s were not really fun . " <p> The idea for Chronicle came to Trank in high school , but it took input from budding screenwriter Jeremy Slater and a reasonable amount of psychotropics to morph the idea into an actual movie . " Josh had just moved to town , and I was one of the only people he knew here in LA , " said Slater , who would go on to be the showrunner for Fox 's The Exorcist series . " We were developing one of my spec scripts that ultimately went nowhere , but mostly just hanging out and smoking a lot of weed and playing video games . Chronicle definitely emerged from some of those hazy nights . " While Trank came up with " 70% of the beats , " Slater said , " the writer sprinkled in elements that would make the story of three fickle teen personalities into popcorn entertainment . The three friends need to obtain superpowers ? Slater suggested some glowing crystals at the bottom of a cave . " I loved it , " Trank said , " because it just did n't need to be explained . " <p> On advice from his agents , Slater passed on writing Chronicle to tackle a promised actual paycheck . Having never completed or sold a feature-length script , Trank felt insecure about pursuing the project alone . " When you 're writing a movie that you 're going to make , as personal as it is , you still have to be a bit objective about it , " he said . " I do n't think I was mature enough to be , at that point . " So he did what any 26-year-old in 2010 would do : He logged on . <p> " I started looking through names on Facebook for someone in LA who I knew , who would tell me that what I was doing sucks . " He landed on Max Landis , the son of writer-director John Landis . " I 'm like , ' Oh , this dude will definitely blow my shit out and be rude about what I did . ' " <p> A feedback session with Landis snowballed into an entire writing session . In Trank 's version of the script , Steve ( Michael B. Jordan ) would get hit by a plane and die halfway through the movie . Landis suggested that , instead , Andrew ( Dane DeHaan ) should save him . " That solved the entire second act , " Trank said . Two days after the meeting , Landis called Trank , begging him not to get mad -- he had just pitched Chronicle to some producers , who wanted a full script . Trank was pissed , but was not in a position to object . Three weeks later , Landis pumped out a draft of the screenplay that was then distributed to the major studios . " Everyone wanted a piece of it , " Trank said . Within 24 hours , Trank 's managers were barking at him to do his laundry and prepare to visit every executive office in the greater Los Angeles area . It was the viral video all over again , except this time , Trank was desperate . " I was like , ' Fucking get me out of this existence . ' " <p> Though Trank and Landis would revise bits of the script before shooting , executives at 20th Century Fox saw Chronicle as a fully formed project and , if produced , a daring play to attract a younger audience . The studio was not in the business of making low-budget films -- at the time , it was also gearing up to prequelize the Alien franchise with Prometheus -- but the confidence on the page and in the room was worth gambling on . Fox gave Chronicle the official green light in January 2011 , a few weeks before Trank 's 27th birthday . <p> Right after Trank sold Chronicle to Fox , someone smashed his car window and lifted 15 hard drives , loaded with scripts and edits . " I had a whole trunk full of dreams , " he joked . But by then he was already laser-focused on getting his directorial debut made , and his champions were rooting him on . Trank cites Fox executive Steve Asbell as a big believer in his skill set and the possibilities that the newcomer could deliver a hit for the studio . Fox 's then-chairman Tom Rothman -- notorious for grappling with directors over the X-Men franchise , but also for adoring film artists ( he co-produced Jim Jarmusch 's Down by Law ) -- " loved the script , but detested the way that I wanted to do it , " Trank said with a laugh . But he could be convinced . <p> Trank hoped Chronicle could break the found-footage mold by using his characters ' telekinetic powers to keep the camerawork always on the move , an approach " so risky and interesting that it 's something that either would be revolutionary in a way or it would be a complete piece of shit . " To appease the skeptical Rothman , Fox bankrolled a test shoot for $10,000 to see if Trank could prevent the movie from devolving into shakycam nonsense . The director started small , orchestrating a proto-version of a scene in which the psychic pranksters move cars with their minds and cause havoc in a diner . The test was enough for Fox to move forward with Trank 's more ballistic dreams . " I thought by the end of the movie , when I 'd have 5,000 cameras floating around the fucking Space Needle , that it would be so ridiculous and over the top that it was almost like the movie screaming at the rest of the world to stop making found-footage movies , because you ca n't do it after this . " <p> Chronicle 's relatively low budget kept Trank insulated from oversight . To keep costs down , executives insisted that he shoot the movie in Cape Town , South Africa , and as he would discover on set , very few Fox executives actually wanted to travel . The found-footage style also prevented later interference ; because each shot was designed around precise actor blocking , action , and special effects , there were few ways for anyone to make editorial changes in post-production . Trank had absolute control , and in the end , it was exactly the movie he wanted to make , down to a murky tone that perplexed the Fox marketing team . <p> " They did n't know exactly what the genre was , " he said . " Genre is such a formulaic , stupid , robotic way of thinking about things . You 're selling a vibe . The trailer cutting houses , on the other hand , were like , ' This is gold . ' " Moviegoers vindicated his work ; Chronicle hit American theaters on Feb. 3 , 2012 , and earned Trank a record-breaking hit . <p> A 17-year-old Josh Trank walked up to the plate with the gait of Babe Ruth and called his shot . A 28-year-old Trank did n't know how to process hitting the home run . A press tour for Chronicle whisked him around the world and left him unsettled . The cigarette habit he picked up on night shoots during the movie intensified . A three-hour meeting with Tom Cruise was surreal in a bad way . " All I felt was anger toward things , " he said . " Anger toward kids that I grew up with . I did n't feel any happiness from that . I did n't know how to embrace happiness . But I was having meetings with Margot Robbie and Emma Stone and Amber Heard . " Two weeks after Chronicle 's release , Trank , who had " beaten Spielberg " and felt adrift , punched through a wall in his house and cracked his hand on a steel beam . <p> Trank had a problem he did n't know how to solve or who to ask to help him solve it . After the wall incident , he called the most notable director in his phone : Sin City and Alita : Battle Angel director Robert Rodriguez , whom he met during the press tour for Chronicle . They were n't chummy , but Trank said Rodriguez was still " Yoda-esque , " talking through success with the young filmmaker and sending him a box of self-help guides . " I 've always had a feeling in anything that I 've ever done in any stage of my life as a post-18-year-old that I 'm in hell , but I 'm crawling out of it . I 'm always on a path , crawling toward the light . " <p> The work , as always , was a way to cope without healing . In the maelstrom of post-Chronicle dealmaking , Trank pitched Sony on a hard-R Venom in the vein of The Mask . Over two weeks in New York , he and his Big Fan director Rob Siegel worked on a treatment for the film , which Amazing Spider-Man producer Matt Tolmach " hated . " And that was the end of that . " I did n't like how Matt Tolmach was coming at me in that situation , because it felt very kind of authoritative , " Trank said . " Well , if you do n't like what I 'm doing , and you 're telling me that I have to do something along the lines of what you want , and you 're going to tell it to me in this way -- sorry , but I have other things I can be doing . " <p> Trank 's stint on Shadow of the Colossus was short enough that he can barely remember the story , though he recalled his writer delivering " one of the most awkward , squirmiest pitches I 've ever seen before . " He would n't return to the film , even today . " I 'm in a very different place now , where I could n't give a fuck about any good video games or turning any property into anything else . " <p> Chronicle 2 , meanwhile , was a never-would for Trank . Landis , who has since been accused of sexual and emotional abuse by eight women , penned a script , focused on a young girl obsessed with the surviving character Matt ( Alex Russell ) who builds her own Iron Man suit . Trank described it as " fine " and having " nothing to do with why I wanted to do " the first movie . When the sequel picked up steam , the director did everything he could to stall progress . " I made it difficult for them to set up meetings . I was dodgy about stuff . I did a lot of shitty things . Because I really did n't ever want to see Chronicle 2 happen . That was my worst nightmare . First of all , I 'm not doing it . Second , if somebody else does it , then you know it 's gon na be a piece of shit . " <p> There are 30-something millennials like Trank who have made it in the business . Greta Gerwig started in " mumblecore " indies before acting in studio movies ( remember the Arthur remake ? ) and finding a groove directing . Black Panther director Ryan Coogler mounted his blockbuster career step by step , clocking time at the Sundance Labs before making Fruitvale Station , then stepping up to make a midbudget sequel he 'd been dreaming about his whole life : Creed . Uncut Gems co-director Josh Safdie , just a few months younger than Trank , has only flirted with studio films , and when it was time to direct an Adam Sandler movie , he did it on low-budget terms . Life catapulted Trank to the studio level on his first movie , and to him , the only way up was to go even bigger . Fantastic Four was that movie . <p> Carrying the mental baggage of Chronicle and a promise of creative control from Fox , Trank entered the development stage of Fantastic Four on the defensive . His first move was to hire Jeremy Slater as his writer . Slater knew comic books , he knew story , and he knew how the director 's brain worked . The two would work together in a vacuum . " There was n't really any sort of traditional pitching process , " Slater said of his first days on the film . " Josh just said , ' Jeremy is writing it for me , ' and Fox nervously said , ' Uhh ... sure . ' " They began work in the spring of 2012 . <p> Again , Trank came to Slater with a skeleton idea : His Fantastic Four would be the opposite of every other franchise kickoff . " The end of the Fantastic Four was going to very organically set up the adventure and the weirdness and the fun . That would be the wish fulfillment of the sequel . Because obviously , the sequel would be , ' OK , now we are superpowered forever and it 's weird and funny and there 's adventure lurking around every corner . ' But the first movie was going to basically be the filmic version of how I saw myself all the time : the metaphor of these characters crawling out of hell . " <p> Developing the script was a similar clamber . Slater was a badge-carrying nerd ready to convert comic book lore into bombastic , CG-ready set-pieces . Trank was the opposite , having seen a few episodes of the Fantastic Four cartoon from the mid- ' 90s and having a general distaste for comic book movies . " The first Avengers movie had recently come out , and I kept saying , ' That should be our template , that 's what audiences want to see ! " Slater said . " And Josh just fucking hated every second of it . " <p> " The trials of developing Fantastic Four had everything to do with tone , " Trank said . " You could take the most ' comic booky ' things , as far as just names and faces and identities and backstories , and synthesize it into a tone . And the tone that Slater was interested in was not a tone that I felt I had anything in common with . " <p> In an effort to creatively engage his director by any means necessary , Slater loaded Trank up with comics from his personal collection -- the greatest Doctor Doom stories , his favorite Ben Grimm moments -- but nothing sparked . Trank was more interested in the early moments , digging into Reed Richards ' character development and traumatic arc . The screenwriting pair would try to find common ground , watching movies for inspiration . What was the Inception version of Fantastic Four ? The Saving Private Ryan version ? The Cronenberg body horror version ? Once the team got its powers , that 's where it started losing Trank . Galactus , Annihilus , Herbie the Robot , time travel , multiple dimensions , old teams fighting young teams -- everything was on the table , and any sequence or character could get tossed out at a moment 's notice . " It did n't matter if they were fighting robots in Latveria or aliens in the Negative Zone or Mole Monsters in downtown Manhattan ; Josh just did not give a shit . " <p> " I feel like I get Mole Man , " Trank said in his defense . " He 's angry and undermined by the system . " <p> Slater estimated that he wrote nearly 18 drafts and 2,000 pages of material during his time on Fantastic Four . Only two of those drafts made it to the studio . In an effort to retain control , Trank acted as the messenger between Fox and Slater , leaving certain studio notes out of their conversations , and only delivering certain drafts to the studio for feedback . " Right from the start of the process , Josh told me I was n't allowed to speak with Fox without him present , " Slater said . " I never saw 95% of those notes . " <p> Slater departed Fantastic Four after six months and , in typical megablockbuster fashion , a handful of Fox-approved screenwriters came on board to knock the script into shootable shape . Simon Kinberg , who had proved himself to Fox by guiding the X-Men franchise with Bryan Singer , would stick around to see the entire production through . At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con , Kinberg admitted he was burned out on superheroes , but one call with Trank convinced him to help make the movie . The two worked well enough together , but as the beginning of production crept closer and closer , and a hard release date hovered over the entire operation , the project moved forward in less than desirable fashion . The script did n't have a third act , and life was compounding the intensity of the situation for Trank . " The only two weapons a movie has are its script and its director , " a source close to production told me , " and this had neither . " <p> The first time I talked to Trank about Fantastic Four was also the first time he slowed down . After a deep breath ( of vape ) , he recounted the details of the shoot like Robert Shaw delivering his Jaws monologue . <p> " There are two emotions when you 're at the helm of something that will represent you : dread or excitement , " Trank said . " There 's not a lot of in-between . There 's so much at stake . You want to be mostly excited , but how will the movie affect my life ? Did I make a mistake on a shot that could hurt me ? " <p> Trank faced immense pressure as he worked on the script , storyboards , previsualized set-pieces , and casting , and much of it was born from his own anxieties . The director came from behind with Chronicle , and was suddenly in charge of something that everyone expected to be a huge success . " That requires a degree of experience that we often underestimate , " one source close to the production said . Trank took bold swings where he could . Early on , he insisted to Fox that Chronicle star Michael B. Jordan was the guy to play Johnny Storm , a character traditionally depicted as white . " For the world I grew up in , a racially intense Los Angeles where we were used to seeing white superheroes , some of my friends who were black should have seen a black superhero ... so I felt that while being in a position of power , I could change the system a little bit . " Miles Teller ( Whiplash ) , Jamie Bell ( Jumper ) , and Kate Mara ( Shooter ) , as Johnny 's adopted sister , rounded out the cast . <p> Stanley Kubrick and David Fincher are lauded by film buffs for obsessing over the minutiae , but Trank 's particulars led to issues on a giant studio movie like Fantastic Four . In preproduction , the editor-brained director clashed with his team of previs artists over the flavor of the movie 's action scenes , despite them all being trained in the art of alien invasion choreography . Likewise , on set , not everyone had the time or interest in hearing from the guy who made one pretty good movie . <p> " In a studio scenario , you 're basically being surrounded by veterans who are going to do a hell of a job doing exactly what it is that they do , " Trank said . " Because it 's not your movie . You did n't come up with it . You did n't create these characters . You did n't create this property . This guy was fucking nominated for Oscars . This guy has fucking made 20 movies with Robert Zemeckis . It 's a fucking science-fiction adventure movie . What the fuck do you need to tell them other than the direction of the agreement between you and the studio ? All Zemeckis ' production designer needs to know is whether this is the take , yes or no . " Of course , that type of " yes " or " no " still needed producer and studio approval . " I was aware of the protocol , but I was n't really asking . " <p> Fantastic Four was filmed over the summer of 2014 . Trank did not recall receiving a complaint from the studio during the 72-day shoot , and refuted most of the tiny grievances that came out after the fact . Teller 's I'm-a-movie-star-now approach to acting , which involved questioning even the most low-impact performance requests , caught him off-guard , but a tussle that " nearly became physical , " according to an Entertainment Weekly story from August 2015 , was a moment of miscommunication between two Type-A personalities . As for The Hollywood Reporter piece that suggested " he built a black tent around his monitor " and " cut himself off from everybody , " Trank said that was a traditional video village , and sometimes " you ca n't actually be out standing next to the camera because the camera 's on a fucking dolly . " <p> But Trank 's capacity for juggling the workload and his personal life was tense enough that there was at least momentary consideration over pulling the plug on the movie . Trank likened his eventual on-set correspondence with Fox then-president Emma Watts to reports out of the Demilitarized Zone in the Korean Peninsula : There was never bad news , per se , but the general feeling was that war could erupt at any moment . The intensity existed , Trank said , and life had a way of exacerbating the situation . Early in production , Trank learned from the set that one of his dogs was at the vet after chewing up some vitamins . By the next morning , the dog had died , and the director had the " most emotionally aggressive cry I ever had in my life . " <p> Trank , who has never been one to unplug , picked up on a vocal minority protesting the film over his casting of a black man as Johnny Storm . The uproar became loud enough that Jordan penned an essay on Entertainment Weekly begging people to hear Stan Lee , who endorsed the casting , and move on . " I was getting threats on IMDb message boards saying they were going to shoot me , " Trank said . To find some level of ease , the director kept a loaded .38 Special on his nightstand . <p> " I was so fucking paranoid during that shoot , " said Trank . " If someone came into my house , I would have ended their fucking life . When you 're in a head space where people want to get you , you think , ' I 'm going to defend myself . ' " Trank returned the gun after wrapping production . <p> It did n't help that throughout the making of Fantastic Four , Trank had a second job . A few months before production , Kinberg , who , on top of producing superhero movies for Fox , was a consultant at Lucasfilm , asked Trank if he wanted to make a Star Wars movie . Kinberg knew that Trank had met with Kiri Hart of the Lucasfilm story group after Chronicle , and now the company was interested in hearing his pitch for a spinoff movie . <p> At the time , Trank rented a house in Benedict Canyon just a few blocks from where George Lucas lived with his editor and wife Marcia Lucas when he wrote the first draft of Star Wars . With a few days to mull over Kinberg 's offer , Trank walked up to the Lucas house and basked in its glow . He called it one of the most surreal moments of his life . " The visions that I had in that moment were just out of this world , " he said . He walked back to his home with a three-act pitch for a Boba Fett movie . <p> Trank presented the idea to Hart , Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy , and Disney chairman Alan Horn . Up until that point , only J.J. Abrams had been approved to play in the Star Wars sandbox , and granting permission for a filmmaker to forever impact the moneymaking mythos was a monthslong process . But the guy who made his name with a lightsaber-themed viral video came out the other end with a Star Wars movie deal . <p> The next June , in the middle of production on Fantastic Four , Lucasfilm announced the director as part of the family . " He is such an incredible talent and has a great imagination and sense of innovation , " Kennedy said . " That makes him perfectly suited to Star Wars . " Nearly a year later , Trank would bow out of the movie . " I quit because I knew I was going to be fired if I did n't quit . " <p> The first cut of Fantastic Four caught studio executives off-guard , Trank said . They told the director the movie was n't the marketable romp anyone hoped for . It " was n't for fans . " The morose tone would make people uncomfortable . It made them uncomfortable . " That was the goal , " he told me . At least for him . <p> Reshoots and pickups are standard for modern studio blockbusters , but for Fantastic Four , they were urgent : The movie did n't have an ending . Trank claimed that before production took place , Fox slashed the budget by nearly $30 million , and cut a majority of the spectacle-filled finale , with the idea that one could be filmed in the second round of shooting . But changes to Fantastic Four would become more drastic , and a difficult scheduling process that involved bringing in actors on weekends ( and outfitting them with notable wigs ) made cobbling together a third-act set-piece all the more difficult . According to Slater , most of the finished film turned out to be an expanded version of his initial 40 pages , minus all of the superheroics . <p> Much of the scramble to " save " Fantastic Four remains shrouded by NDAs and Trank 's own lack of participation . Fox hired other writers to generate script pages to be shot during reshoots , though Trank never met them . He wrote pages himself in hopes of putting his voice back in the film , and the pages were dutifully ignored . The director eventually confronted producers over Director 's Guild union rights that " were not being recognized , " and the studio complied . Trank said he negotiated a new deal in which he would reedit the movie while Fox worked on its own cut , and both versions would screen for test audiences . <p> The studio hired editor Stephen Rivkin , whose credited work includes Avatar and the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies , to prepare Fantastic Four for the runoff . Rivkin ultimately chose different takes for every single scene in the movie , and became " the de facto director , " Trank said . And in the director 's mind , Rivkin chose the bad takes . " There are some editors , from my point of view , who prefer using takes for pacing over performance . So they 'll say , ' He moved out of that quicker , ' or , ' He did this quicker . ' It 's about a certain kind of a rhythm that they are looking for . " There are moments in the finished film that Trank appreciates -- Doctor Doom blowing up security guard heads as he strolls down a hallway , the scene in which Tim Blake Nelson 's head explodes , the shriek-filled introduction of mutated Reed Richards ' elastic body ( in which no heads explode ) -- but the director found Rivkin 's ultimate decisions to be cheesy . " I maybe saw a couple of shots that really resonated . " <p> Unfortunately for Trank , the two versions of Fantastic Four were never in a faceoff . In January 2015 , he realized that " there was no path out of hell , " and that the studio had already spent three months , plus millions of dollars , for planned rewrites and reshoots that would fit Rivkin 's cut . A teaser trailer that month supposedly inspired new directions for the film , which by then was out of Trank 's hands . " They really do pay attention to what people are saying on Twitter . They look at that and they say , ' Shit , people are freaked out about how it 's not going to be funny . So we need to spend $10 million to do a comedy rewrite . ' " Trank edited his version anyway , hoping Fox would pluck select scenes and drop them into Rivkin 's cut . Maybe critics would see those moments and give him the benefit of the doubt . Maybe . <p> A sense of loss sank in during reshoots . The contention left Trank defeated , and his new goal -- to appease the producers , who might incorporate as many chunks of his personal cut into the finished product as possible -- went against his artistic tenets . " It was like being castrated , " he said of being on the set , which was overseen by Kinberg and producer Hutch Parker . " You 're standing there , and you 're basically watching producers blocking out scenes , five minutes ahead of when you get there , having editors hired by the studio deciding the sequence of shots that are going to construct whatever is going on , and what it is that they need . And then , because they know you 're being nice , they 'll sort of be nice to you by saying , ' Well , does that sound good ? ' You can say yes or no . " This time , Trank said yes . He wanted to keep his job . <p> Whispers of the turmoil reached Disney and Kathleen Kennedy at Lucasfilm . No one had seen the cut of Fantastic Four that would arrive in theaters ( including Trank ) , but the he-said-she-said dispute was enough to shake her confidence . Trank said he and Kennedy agreed that the director should sit out his scheduled appearance at the 2015 Star Wars Celebration in April , but even then , he could n't pick the conversation back up . Fantastic Four , the Star Wars spinoff that was n't , all the other development deals -- they were the end of something . Shortly after bowing out of the convention over a case of the " worst flu of my life , " as he tweeted , Trank told his managers he would n't do Star Wars and would n't look for more blockbuster work . Days later , the trades announced that the director was " fired " off his Star Wars movie . <p> Trank tried to keep a straight face through the summer of 2015 . He promoted the marketing of his ill-fated blockbuster on Facebook and Twitter . He played hype man on the Jumbotron of San Diego Comic-Con 's Hall H. In interviews , he defended against the finger-pointing with level-headed messaging . " It 's been a challenging movie -- for all of the right reasons , " he told the Los Angeles Times . The tweet , as he sized up in retrospect , was spitting in the face of every person who attempted to make his version of Fantastic Four work . It offended his collaborators and silenced the friends he had in the industry . He went out swinging to defend a " fantastic version of Fantastic Four " -- a version of the movie that no one , including Trank , can really say existed . <p> Before Fantastic Four , Trank woke at 6 a.m. on the dot . After the release , he found himself falling asleep by then , oozing out of bed around noon , and not knowing what to do with himself until he eventually crashed again . " I had been exposed to a permanent version of reality where I had no reason to live because there was nothing that I desired , " he said . " I did n't want to be a big filmmaker anymore . That 's all I ever wanted . I did n't know what I was anymore . " He had no interest in going back to where he was before Fantastic Four , either . <p> Trank combated insomnia and , in therapy , coped with the feeling of wanting " to fucking die . " His breakthrough happened after three months of " utter silence , " when he began self-critiquing what he saw as a streak of arrogance and misplaced ambition in the form of lengthy journal entries . The exercise drew a line in the sand : That was then , and this was now . " When I realized that I could start over , that was the first moment that I suddenly felt something again . Starting over began with writing the first page of Fonzo . " Starting over also meant moving on from his one stable relationship ; in May 2016 , Trank and his wife separated , and a year later they formally divorced ( He declined to discuss the fallout in detail , due to his ex-wife 's own involvement in the business and what he said is now an amicable relationship . ) <p> Fonzo ( later retitled to the more marketable Capone ) emerged from the back of Trank 's head . As a kid , he fell down the Al Capone factoid vortex , reading up on everything he possibly could about the gangster bootlegger . In the void of work , when he " suddenly was n't fielding a thousand calls a day and having a hundred emails in my inbox , " the mental biography archived in the back of his brain bubbled back to the surface . Trank would close his eyes and sit for hours at a time , stewing on the humiliation and confusion and going wherever his mind took him . " It felt like such a different reality , all of a sudden , " he said . David Lynch might call the practice transcendental meditation . Trank resisted the formal label ; he just saw them as " trips . " Whatever it was , out of those swirling dream sessions came a tone poem update on classic Edward G. Robinson and Jimmy Cagney movies . Trank wanted to examine the gangster 's life after imprisonment , when dementia melded his violent past with everyday life with family . The filmmaker related to the sweaty blur . <p> A post shared by Josh Trank ( @joshuatrank ) on May 21 , 2019 at 5:14am PDT <p> Trank was ostensibly in Movie Jail , but for the director , it felt more like an occupational round of Let 's Make a Deal . Behind doors No. 1 , 2 , and 3 were the fates of Capone , which Trank would either direct into a movie or watch collect dust in a pile on some executive 's desk . There was also the cash prize : directing TV and work-for-hire gigs . Months after Fantastic Four , when the need for income started becoming a reality , he discussed genre projects stuck in development -- someone will eventually direct the Pumpkinhead reboot -- and episodic work with networks . " They 'd all say , ' Movies are the worst places to be . Let 's make something dark here ! ' " Trank passed . <p> Between the emerging thesis of the 2016 election and the acerbic commentary on his Fantastic Four experience , Trank felt more aware of his place in the show business cosmos . " I looked at myself and saw the whole white privilege thing , " he said . Incredible directors have made careers out of pilot shoots and EP credits , but Trank was stubborn . He saw accepting a director job as failing up to the path of least resistance , and by his own admission , he was still hung up on the art of it all . " Market-driven creativity is about just coming up with shit , " he said . " I think the product is a creation , but it 's not necessarily creative work . " So Trank pointed to the sky and called his shot yet again : He 'd only come back if he wrote a script that someone would let him direct . <p> For eight months , Trank tore through drafts of Capone as his life leveled out . Reminders of his failure slipped through his blinders . On Feb. 27 , 2016 , Fantastic Four won the Razzies for Worst Picture , Worst Director , and Worst Remake of the year . It would n't have hurt as much if a production assistant had n't accepted the award on no one 's behalf . ( " The dude saw me chain-smoking , and probably heard me crying a few times . That 's petty . " ) That June , The Hollywood Reporter 's Kim Masters , who originally reported on Fantastic Four the year prior , took the opportunity to ask Kathleen Kennedy and Steven Spielberg about the director . " So when you look at young directors , how do you know you 're not hiring another Josh Trank who directed the Fox bomb Fantastic Four ? " she asked . " Who is that ? " Spielberg wondered . In a text at the time , Trank shrugged off the viral shade . " At least I know he watched Chronicle , " he wrote . <p> By early 2016 , he had producers and name talent nipping at the script . Conversations were ramping up with Tom Hardy , who was vocal about playing Capone at some point in his career . Then in May , Trank separated from his wife of three years . The two had met in 2013 , just as Trank quit drinking , juggled multiple development deals , went to work on Fantastic Four , and was at the top of the world . Six months into a courtship , they were married . " I was so certain that I knew exactly all of the answers in life because I succeeded in a way that went against the advice of everybody older than me . So I assumed that anything I felt passionately about , it was important for me to take it all the way to its most conclusive state . " He declined to go into specifics about the relationship , though he had no regrets . " If you feel it strongly in your heart , it 's better to be proven wrong than to not ever know if you 're right . " <p> As he and his producers courted Hardy for Capone , Trank floated from his sister 's guest room to Joe Carnahan 's desert vacation home ( the Narc director bonded with Trank over their mutual habit of calling out bullshit on Twitter ) to his dad 's place to the no-frills Santa Monica apartment . Trank , in full hustle mode , took directing and editing pay cuts to make the budget work , and flew himself to London to palaver with his actor of choice . He and Hardy hit it off : They were both prone to long , abstract conversations about art . They were no-bullshit about the industry . They loved vaping . Hardy signed on to the film in the summer of 2016 , and by October , Trank 's name was back in the trades as the movie 's producers courted foreign buyers who 'd put up the money for a prestige star vehicle . <p> Self-realization and healing does not guarantee a third-act triumph like in the movies . Though Capone got the green light in December 2016 to shoot the following March in New Orleans , Trank and his assistant John , who quit his writer 's assistant job to join the director on his journey , found themselves in a holding pattern due to scheduling conflicts with Hardy 's next film , Triple Frontier . With John having given up his apartment to move to Louisiana , and Trank back in his dad 's basement , the two moved into the bleak two-bedroom in Santa Monica , and rode out the downtime by storyboarding and playing video games . After five months of sleeping on blow-up mattresses and playing Ghost Recon with Hardy came the promise of a fall 2017 start for Capone . That went out the window when Triple Frontier did n't happen and Sony wanted Hardy to play Venom in the same time frame . Could Trank squeeze in his movie over the summer ? Everyone agreed it was possible . A few weeks later , Trank and John loaded up the director 's Tahoe with their minimal possessions and drove to Georgia to finally begin preproduction . <p> At the time , Trank was dealing with a souring , maybe-relationship , and the departure was both stressful and a relief . Thankfully , the future was in Savannah . After six days of road tripping , the pair arrived in in Georgia , where they celebrated with a late-night dinner . Then , at around 5 a.m. the next morning , John woke up to the sound of Trank screaming . To accommodate Hardy and Venom , production on Capone would be delayed until 2018 . They had their hotel rooms for the week , so waited to go back , John walking the dogs and Trank stewing inside . <p> On the way home , the two picked up some KFC drive-thru to calm their spirits -- but the cashier forgot utensils . After pulling over at a gas station to find a few spoons , John came back to find Trank sobbing and shoveling mashed potatoes in his mouth . " That was the darkest day , " John told me on the set of Capone . " There was no certainty that it was going to happen or not . It was all Tom 's word . ... The whole year was a weird limbo year . We did n't end up doing anything . " <p> Photos : Greg Williams/Vertical Entertainment <p> ( L to R ) DP Peter Deming and Trank ; Tom Hardy as Fonzo ; Kyle MacLachlan as Karlock ; Trank in a cameo and Jack Lowden as Crawford <p> In the spring of 2018 , I stood on the Covington , Louisiana , set of Capone , a movie that actually happened . The 18-acre mansion property , tucked alongside the Bogue Falaya River and standing in for Capone 's Florida compound , bustled with old-timey picture cars and heavies in trimmed suits . Matt Dillon , with slicked-back hair and a snug vest , sat by a lake waiting for rehearsal . Off to the side , Tom Hardy danced to a hip-hop track , a pair of blaring headphones adding some anachronistic quirk to his decaying-gangster makeup . Trank sat by the monitor , visibly giddy as his crew placed a giant sun-diffusing flag above his actors to meet the demands of legendary Twin Peaks : The Return cinematographer Peter Deming . Despite the harsh midday sun , there was no black tent -- just the shade of a giant oak tree . <p> The three days I spent on set -- which faced typical , life-draining production snags , from Hardy 's Venom press schedule to smearing the proper amount of poop on a bed where Capone has accidentally soiled himself -- were the most alive I had seen Trank , and every moment felt like wish fulfillment . On the first night , the head of makeup gave her director a clean shave , and a costumer outfitted him with a weathered overcoat so he slid seamlessly into a scene with the electric Kyle MacLachlan . Two days after his cameo turn , Trank sat with Hardy in the wee hours of the night , taking a little more time than his assistant director would have liked for a scene in which Capone wakes up his wife Mae ( Linda Cardellini ) with a bellowing moan and a foul bedtime accident . The director personally dressed his main actor in fake diarrhea for the scene , much to the chagrin of his continuity-checking script supervisor , who exclaimed , " There was n't that much shit in the last scene ! " <p> The shame of Fantastic Four was not present on Capone . The on-set Trank was an entertainer , spending his in-between moments as he would behind closed doors : talking about movies and sharing anecdotes from the trenches of Hollywood . Only 34 at the time , he spun yarns like a grizzled veteran without a trace of Kubrickian darkness . The energy was the reason producer Russell Ackerman , who started as Guillermo del Toro 's assistant and saw his fair share of movie studio hurdle-jumping , did n't overthink the trade reports when he teamed with the director to make Capone . " I went in having heard about the Josh Trank stories , but I also went in not caring , necessarily , " Ackerman told me on set . " I connected with him as a person . He pitched me this idea , and I just got it . His manager said , ' It 's kind of a crazy idea , ' and it was n't . It sounded genius . " <p> During the shoot , Trank lived in a guest house off of Hardy 's rental home . He had his own place , but retreated behind to the safety of the actor 's gated compound -- after everything that happened in New Orleans on Fantastic Four , he wanted to lie low , and Hardy had security . But the minute he stepped on set , the perpetual punk-rock teen shook off the anxiety to schmooze his own cast and crew . Between takes , he told stories of the ups and downs of Fantastic Four that would 've made an executive twitch . The rigorous work of a traditional film set was in full swing , but as I roamed the halls of this preserved manor , and struck up side conversations with producers , PAs , and other below-the-line crew , there was a sense that people enjoyed the shaggy , oddball tenor of this particular set . They wanted to help Josh Trank make his movie . <p> Trank on the set of Capone.Photo : Greg Williams/Vertical Entertainment <p> Trank had high hopes for where Capone might go . Considering its Euro edge , the director hoped to debut the film at the Cannes or Berlin film festivals , or maybe Sundance , if the time was right . Though he completed the film at the end of 2018 , grand premiere plans hit a snag when major theatrical and streaming distributors saw , and passed on releasing , the film . Trank chalked it up to an industry wary of challenging art . Whatever the case , it was a business issue . Bron Studios , the company behind the production , asked Trank to find a new editor who could tailor the film for a wider audience . Trank swallowed his pride and accepted the deal without a tweetstorm . <p> Trank and his producing team delivered more cuts , and waited for answers . Unlike on Fantastic Four , patience paid off . Vertical Entertainment eventually picked up Capone , promising the director to release his original version in a theatrical run . When the coronavirus hit , plans changed and concessions were made . <p> " I think I 'm in a good place mentally , " Trank said a few weeks before his film 's video-on-demand release . " There 's nothing you can really do . " <p> During two years of release limbo , Trank floated back to Brooklyn , then to upstate New York , then back to Los Angeles , where he could " be physically closer to the business . " That was a necessity ; to make Capone at his preferred budget level , Trank took a pay cut of upwards of $40,000 , " to the point where I just ended up , like , broke . " He returned to LA to land a paying gig . In the interim , he made money rewriting scripts , including a Theodore Roosevelt biopic , and penning Blown , a limited series about the early days of the CIA after World War II , in which Hardy is intended to star . In the filmmaker 's mind , writing for hire maintains the sanctity of his art , which still matters . <p> Trank likened directing to a pilot seat . He wants to make movies where he 's in the cockpit of an F-15 , clutching the controls and maneuvering like the Maverick of mise-en-sc ? ne . In his mind , jumping into a giant blockbuster is more like buckling into the Peter Pan ride at Disneyland : " It 's a simulation , but it feels like the magic of flying . " He respects those who do it , but he ca n't . " I have to direct my own scripts , " he said in a familiar tone . Critical reaction and an evolving market will ultimately decide whether that 's possible . <p> Since the debut of Fantastic Four , the studio release strategy has experienced a full continental drift , cracking open a wide chasm between billion-dollar blockbuster bets and everything else . Corporations have moved in the opposite direction ; in 2019 , The Walt Disney Co. acquired 21st Century Fox , with most of the old Fox regime drifting away . It 's unclear how the coronavirus will reshape the way movies are made and released , but any concessions will warp storytelling , too . Navigating it all will be an emerging set of artists -- more and more from diverse backgrounds , genders , and groups long overlooked -- who live and breathe cinematic art . Those writing the checks , gambling on the industry 's survival , will demand every ounce of those filmmakers ' ingenuity . They 'll also scrutinize every move , every choice , and find someone new if it does n't work out . Moviemaking is the enforced bonding of irreconcilable opposites , and beyond 2020 , it 's poised to be more polarized . <p> As a child star of the directing track , Trank is no longer one of the industry 's new and promising voices . There will be more like him , and his contemporaries who incrementally built up careers are on steadier ground . Now he needs to move forward , move on , and make good on the myth of his early success . He seems to understand all this , and as he prepared to put Capone out for public scrutiny , he emphasized that it 's only winding him up to work more . <p> " I 'm overly aware of how fortunate I am to do this for a living , and because of that , I forced myself to work 10 times harder than what seems normal , " he said . " I have to do something unique . I wo n't allow myself to sit back and lap up the luxury that comes with being able to do this for a living . Like , that will never be me . " <p> No matter how many times Trank quit then logged back on to Instagram , or deactivated then reactivated Twitter , he could n't cold-turkey quit the internet and really move on . Last November , the filmmaker created an account on Letterboxd , a moviegoers haven in which users track their viewing habits with informal reviews . Now he was back online , reviewing Fantastic Four , saying he " expected it to be much worse than it was . " In just a handful of words , the director praised the actors and curtailed any talk of #ReleaseTheTrankCut . At the end , he wrote out the mantra he 's been telling himself for four years : " I do n't regret any of it . " <p> Capone arrives to VOD on May 12 . <p> Correction ( May 6 ) : A previous version of this article misstated that Trank rewrote a version of Leonardo DiCaprio 's upcoming biopic Roosevelt . Trank worked on an adaptation of the biography The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt that reps have clarified is separate from that project . We 've edited the article to reflect this .
@@31841641 <p> I 'm a 55-year-old woman who 's been married to a 56-year-old man for nearly 30 years . We have sex at least twice a week , and it 's better than ever ! However , I 've noticed now that when I get in positions where I twerk a lot -- like on all fours , cowgirl positions , 69ing , etc. -- my lower back is tweaked afterward and hurts for a day . It goes away until the next time when I 'm fine during sex and do n't feel the back pain until afterward . I know if I lost some weight that would help . Is there any exercises I can do to strengthen my back so I can still twerk on him when he drives me crazy ? I have no idea where to find exercises for strengthening my back for twerking ? I 'm not ready to be relegated to side-only positions and activities . <p> -- Twerk Out <p> Dear Twerk Out , <p> I had an inkling that core work was the way to solve your problem , so I reached out to Olive TuPartie , a glamorous staple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven years of experience as a Pilates instructor . Here 's what she had to say : <p> Women tend to be more flexible and sometimes overextend their low backs , and we just need to do a little maintenance to keep our low abdominals , low back , and pelvic floor strong and working together . First , let 's talk posture : In general , you want a nice " s " shape , so that if you were to lie against the floor , your head , ribs , and tail bone would be heavy in the floor , and there would be space between the floor and your low back and neck . This is how you want to walk around in the world , too ! <p> From here , let 's talk exercise to prep you for your positions . Lying on your back , bend your knees to have your feet flat on the floor , and then exhale and press your belly button into your spine , squeeze your butt , squeeze the pelvic floor ( that feeling of squeezing like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scoop your tail bone up to the ceiling . Hold for three breaths , and release back to neutral . You want to feel like you are pulling your hip bones to your ribs and really curling the tail bone to the sky . Do this five times , starting to move with your breath and connecting your low abs , low back , pelvic floor , and inner thighs . After these five breaths , heal and roll your spine up as you lift your hips to the ceiling . Think about your spine and rib cage here : You want to roll up like your spine is a strand of heavy pearls being lifted from the floor , your ribs are knit together in the front , and your low belly is still working with your glutei to keep the tailbone reaching forward and not down ! Take a breath , squeeze your butt to lift your hips higher , then exhale to roll down , ribs to tail . Repeat 10 times , and then do the whole sequence again from the top ! <p> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should be feeling pretty fabulous . Then stretch at the end by just putting your right ankle over your left knee and pulling your left knee toward your chest , hold for a minute , and then repeat on the opposite side . Make sure you do n't let your low abs go during sex , they work with your back muscles to support your low spine , and the better you get at connecting them and strengthening them , the better for all activity ! <p> I 've been seeing this guy romantically for nine months , but we have been friends for at least four or five years . I 'm a Muslim and he is not . For Ramadan , I told him that I ca n't do anything sexual , so for this month I need him to hold off . Just until Ramadan is over . I 'm pretty easygoing , so I do n't demand much , but I told him I 'm taking Ramadan seriously and that this is one thing that I do demand , to respect my boundaries . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was having a hard time . And I was truly appreciative of his effort , despite his struggles ( he has a high sex drive ) -- until one night that I slept at his place . I was extremely tired that day , so I fell asleep as soon as I lay down in his bed . As I 'm sleeping , I feel his hands groping my boobs . And though that made me slightly uncomfortable , I was OK with it . But then he starts going near my vagina area . Usually when I get extremely overwhelmed , I freeze up . So at that point , I was frozen . I could only hope that he would n't actually go down there . He 's known about my past experience with sexual assault , and yet he kept going , slowly building up to it until he stuck his fingers down and started to finger me . <p> At this point I was shocked and in disbelief . After he took his fingers out , he started pulling down my pants . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . I was still frozen . After a couple of shakes , name calling , and tapping on the face , he stopped and hugged me . I waited until I heard him snore to get his hands off me . He immediately woke up , and I told him I 'm going home , so he walked me out . I could n't believe he took advantage of me . He then proceeded to call me and explain that he did not know I was asleep , and that he was trying to be spontaneous and flirty , but when he realized that I could possibly be asleep , he stopped . He was truly sorry and disgusted with himself . And when I brought up the point that he knew my boundaries and that I had made it clear I did n't want to do anything sexual , he said he knew , but he was n't thinking when it was happening and thought I was OK until he realized maybe I was n't OK . Now I 'm very conflicted on how I should feel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out and decided to still continue our relationship . Apparently , it 's eating him alive , which I do believe . But at the same time , just because it 's true , that does n't mean it did n't happen -- he disregarded my wishes . Which was what led to it in the first place . And I keeping going back and forth with anger and forgiveness . I just want an outside view . I ca n't tell my friends because my friends are also his friends , and I still care about him deeply . I 'm just extremely conflicted at the moment . <p> -- Violated <p> Dear Violated , <p> You told your boyfriend that you had chosen to remain celibate through a certain period of time , and he started touching you sexually before that period of time ended . That alone would have been inappropriate and shown a clear disregard for your desires and boundaries . Whether he thought you were awake or not , his actions were not OK . Whether he saw you freeze or not , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his actions were against your stated wishes . Depending on where you live , this may legally be considered sexual assault . <p> It sounds like your only friends are also friends of your boyfriend 's . That 's also a red flag . If your boyfriend somehow came between you and friends you had before you met this group , I 'd be more concerned than I already am . Reconnect with people you have n't seen in a while , and make some new friends who have nothing to do with this guy . <p> The conflict you 're saying you 're experiencing makes sense . Many people report a similar reaction . You 've been violated by someone close to you , and that breach of trust can be disorienting . You absolutely can feel forgiving and angry at the same time . Even during this COVID pandemic , many mental health providers are able to see you digitally . And if that 's out of your budget , or you do n't want to wait until an appointment can be made , you can call organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevention program 's hotline . There 's another organization called HEART that might have some resources for you if you 'd prefer a faith-driven organization . They have a section on their site where you can contact a counselor . <p> Take care of your body . Make sure you 're eating properly and staying hydrated as best you can with Ramadan occurring . And make sure you 're getting enough sleep . Keep up your spiritual practice . Take up breathing -- even if it 's only a handful of breaths . Generally , be kind to yourself . <p> Forgiveness does n't have to mean the relationship continues . If you want to give your boyfriend a second chance , that 's your decision , and I will nervously wish you all the best , but you can absolutely forgive and still move on . I suggest you do just that . <p> Help ! How can I support Slate so I can keep reading all the advice from Dear Prudence , Care and Feeding , Ask a Teacher , and How to Do It ? Answer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> My husband and I have been quarantined for seven weeks in a small two-bedroom house with a toddler . We make a weekly trip out for errands , and that 's it , aside from exercise and sanity walks . We are thankfully still working and doing it from home . Our families are safe , though I worry about my older mom . But like I said : mostly fine . The problem , if it is one , is that the pandemic has made my husband wildly horny . We both have fairly high libidos , but this is not like ever before , even when we first started dating . He 's all over me whenever we 're in the same room -- which is , you know , a lot . The kid goes down for a nap , he 's trying for a quickie . Then he wants to stay up late to do it again , or for a third time , if we did it in the morning .

He 's an empathetic guy and would never pressure me intentionally . <p> -- Lust Overload <p> Dear Lust Overload , <p> Your husband 's higher interest in sex probably is at least partially a reaction to the COVID situation and associated stressors .

Share your emotions and ask him to navigate this with you together . <p> Think about what you enjoy -- for instance , the increased flirtation and flattery . So you might tell your husband that you appreciate that but do n't always feel like escalating into physical contact .

When I first began watching porn on VHS , anal was not very common . I remember in Randy West 's " Up and Cummers , " he vehemently insisted that there be no mixture of vaginal and anal sex . I even remember him in the shower instructing that if there was to be vaginal sex after anal , a thorough dick-cleaning needed to proceed in order to prevent an infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In today 's porn , not only does it seem that anal is featured significantly , but that the old rules have been thrown out the window . <p> How do today 's porn starlets not have problems when they regularly get penetrated both anally and vaginally in the same scene ( you can clearly see there is no break in the action ) ? Ass to mouth also seems to be a requirement . This is repulsive to me , and that 's a problem , because it means more women are expected to do these things in bed . <p> -- Anal Inquiries <p> Dear Anal Inquiries , <p> We have a serious public health problem where people are using pornography as sexual education . If people cited The Fast and the Furious as the reason they 're driving recklessly , we would reject that excuse .

You can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can watch some of the material pornographers produce that is intended as education , like Jessica Drake 's Wicked Sex series or the Nina Hartley 's Guide to ... series . You can take classes at your local sex shop , swingers club , and -- thanks to COVID requiring that we all move our events online -- you can even take digital classes from the comfort of your own home . You can read books . " I saw it in a porno " is no justification for acting inappropriately , any more than " I saw it in a romance movie " is an acceptable reason to stalk someone . <p> " Because it means more women are expected to do these things in bed " particularly irks me . The sentiment that one woman did something once so all women should allow it is backward and vaguely -- if not fully -- coercive . If you 're having sex with people who think that them seeing something in a porn clip means you should participate in it , rethink your dating choices . While we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something once yourself in no way means you have to participate in it a second time . <p> As for how today 's performers deal with the ramifications of ass-to-pussy , well , we rinse our orifices out pretty well beforehand and hope for the best . We also tend to shower immediately after the scene . Generally speaking , porn performers are more like stuntpeople , or professional wrestlers . We 're taking physical risks and performing athletically for an entertainment medium . Stopping to wash implements in between orifices often kills the momentum of the scene , making the experience more difficult for the performers and reducing the appeal of the product for most consumers . <p> Oh , and yes : Touching a vulva or mouth after touching an anus , without washing first with soap , is totally unsanitary . <p> -- Stoya <h> More How to Do It <p> I have some strange and severe allergies as well as moderate asthma . There 's a sweet guy I have my eye on , but he 's an avid smoker . Even if he switches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and semen ? I usually get a contact rash when I 'm near smokers and it gets on my clothes , so I have to shower immediately upon returning home before the rash gets itchier . I do n't want to end up in the hospital by direct experimentation , so I thought to check the internet first -- and all I 'm getting is a possible connection of nicotine in semen to a greater risk of cervical cancer . Everything else is erectile dysfunction -- related material for the smoker himself . Nothing about allergic reactions . I do sometimes have an asthma attack after sex , so I use my rescue inhaler . I do n't recall this one being covered under standard allergen testing . Should I stay in the nonsmoking section , or is there a way to safely check for possible reactions before PIV sex ? Full-body latex ? Abuse of Bubble Wrap ? Dueling dildos at 50 paces ?
@@31841841 <p> Colorado recorded a nearly 20% increase in deaths in March and April as the novel coronavirus swept the state , according to state data that provides an early glimpse of the broader impact of the pandemic . <p> The data from the state health department shows deaths in Colorado are on the rise from 2019 levels , largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 respiratory disease . However , medical and public health experts cautioned it 's still too early to measure the pandemic 's full toll . <p> " That 's something that will be argued and debated undoubtedly for a generation , " said Dr. Leon Kelly , El Paso County 's coroner , who also has served as deputy medical director for the county 's public health department during the coronavirus crisis . " What price did we truly pay as a society for the pandemic ? " <p> Overall , deaths are on the rise in 2020 , as January and February also saw slight jumps .

In 2019 , 6,761 people died in Colorado during those two months , but this year the number of deaths in that same time frame increased by 1,341 to an estimated 8,102 deaths . But there 's a lag in death certificate data , meaning the number of deaths in April could still rise further . <p> Kirk Bol , manager of the state health department 's vital statistics program , said the increase in deaths this year can be attributed largely to the coronavirus , as well as Colorado 's growing and aging population . <p> The most recent death certificate data shows there were 644 COVID-19 deaths in Colorado in March and April . That 's more than the 461 individuals who died in Colorado from influenza or pneumonia in all of 2019 , according to the death certificate data . <p> Unlike that breakdown of coronavirus fatalities in the death certificate data , the Department of Public Health and Environment 's tally includes more recent information , and shows the number of deaths reported into May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with COVID-19 in Colorado since the virus was first confirmed in the state in early March , according to the agency . <h> Pandemic altering mortality rates <p> The additional numbers also could include those who died indirectly from the outbreak , such as people who did n't seek needed medical treatment . <p> The pandemic is affecting every part of society , meaning it could alter mortality rates in multiple ways , said Dr. Lisa Miller , professor of epidemiology at the Colorado School of Public Health . <p> For example , she said , has there been an increase in domestic violence as more people stay home ? Or are there fewer heart attacks or severe asthma attacks because the air is cleaner from fewer cars on the road ? <p> Tracking the number of people who died either directly or indirectly as a result of the outbreak is complex , and therefore , the numbers from public health officials are more of an estimate , according to the experts . <p> Even with influenza , a disease that has been around for decades , the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because public health officials know that they ca n't capture them all as not everyone is tested for the flu , Miller said . <p> With COVID-19 , testing has been limited since the start of the outbreak and there are far more cases of COVID-19 in Colorado than have been confirmed . It 's also widely believed the novel coronavirus likely was in Colorado as early as January . <p> As a result , it 's possible there are COVID-19 deaths that were missed and classified as something else . Likewise , there are deaths that could be counted as COVID-19 that were caused by another illness , according to medical experts . <p> " You 've got a brand new disease and to think that this is a straightforward issue would be naive , " Miller said . " It 's not straightforward .

" It 's undoubtedly , in some places , undercounted deaths . " <h> Overall toll of the pandemic <p> There are concerns about the indirect impact of the pandemic . If there was a surge in coronavirus cases , more police and firefighters could become sick and that could lead to more deaths if they are n't able to respond to potentially life-threatening situations . Or if sanitation workers become sick , then it makes it more difficult for cities to manage their waste . <p> Physicians increasingly are worried that patients are not seeking care when they become sick because they are afraid of contracting the new coronavirus . <p> So far , the medical examiner 's office in El Paso County , which also serves 20 other counties , has not yet seen a large increase in individuals dying from heart attacks , other preventable deaths or suicides , Kelly said . <p> In fact , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as social-distancing policies first rolled out earlier this year . It 's in the last three to four weeks that those deaths have started to increase , he said . <p> There were no big changes in the number of homicides in the state until April , when the number of such deaths dropped from 17 in March to eight in April . That is down from 24 homicides in April 2019 , according to the death certificate data . <p> Likewise , Centura Health has experienced a decrease in trauma cases across its health system . <p> Since March 1 , the system 's doctors have treated about 99 patients for injuries from car crashes , down from 169 patients during the same period last year . Another 91 patients were treated for injuries from skiing and other winter activities , a decrease from 289 patients last year , according to data provided by Centura Health . <p> " It truly is premature to draw any conclusions about what we know of the true mortality rate , " Cobb said . <p> Jessica joined the Denver Post as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including mental health , hospitals and health care costs .

@@31844541 <h> Douglas Rooks : A federal judge in search of the truth <p> With Donald Trump 's statement that he was " surprised " by Dr. Anthony Fauci 's comments before a Senate committee that the nation could run undue risks by reopening too soon , we 've closed the circle on how this president intends to deal with the coronavirus crisis . <p> No one could actually be surprised , since the many unknown variables for this pandemic form the reality of our days , and our nightmares as well . <p> That Trump pretends to be surprised only confirms what we already knew : that a president who has yet to come up with a plan for anything is not going to come up with one here , either . To the nation 's governors , the message is clear : You 're on your own , and do n't expect any further help . <p> It 's eerily similar to earlier Republican attitudes , fully adopted by Trump , about global warming . First , it 's a " hoax " concocted by his adversaries , then it 's a problem too big to do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only thing that really matters to him : maintaining power by winning re-election in November . Coronavirus may even be useful , in that it may distract attention from other outrageous behavior . <p> Take the Department of Justice 's attempt to dismiss two guilty pleas entered by Michael Flynn , Trump 's first National Security advisor , for lying to federal investigators -- the one criminal case brought by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller before turning things back over to the DOJ , which quickly shelved the Russia investigation . <p> Flynn pleaded guilty more than two years ago , but has never been sentenced because he 's tried to withdraw the pleas , in which effort he was encouraged and celebrated by the president , using his other favorite word : " witchhunt . " <p> Trump has spoken of pardoning Flynn , but perhaps decided that might be a bridge too far , and instead prevailed on Attorney General William Barr to request dismissal . Barr , who 's become Trump 's personal attorney in all but name , had to work pretty hard to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one from St. Louis to make the necessary recommendation . Withdrawing a plea without giving an even plausible reason is not something prosecutors do , but Barr was more than willing . <p> The administration plan encountered what the New York Times called an " astonishing " roadblock when Judge Emmet Sullivan refused to dismiss , and instead brought in a former prosecutor and federal judge , John Gleeson , to investigate the reasons for the dismissal request . <p> Gleeson , who 's put notorious mobsters behind bars , should be up to the task , and while he 's at work , it 's doubtful the president can return to the pardon idea . What was " astonishing " was not the judge 's decision , but the Attorney General 's move to dismiss in the first place . <p> Not since Watergate has an Attorney General so signally failed to uphold the law , and Barr 's performance may yet make John Mitchell -- who served 19 months in prison -- look like a mere co-conspirator . It 's worth recalling that Maine 's Sen. Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sen. Angus King voted no . <p> The Flynn maneuvering was part of a larger attempt to convince voters that , not only was Trump 's impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his November rival , Joe Biden , a " witchhunt , " but the earlier Russia investigation -- originated after Vladimir Putin 's well-documented interference in 2016 on Trump 's behalf -- was also baseless . <p> That this narrative has gotten this far is alarming , but it may have met its match in the person of one low-ranking federal judge . In this , too , it recalls Watergate -- the last time a president was held accountable for illegal and unconstitutional actions . <p> John Sirica was presiding over the trial of five defendants in what the Nixon administration termed a " third rate burglary attempt , " and was unsatisfied that their connections with Republican operatives had been revealed . By keeping the case open , and encouraging prosecutors to keep digging , this federal judge did as much to bring a president to justice as congressional investigating committees . <p> No one imagines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; expectations for this administration have fallen below anything Richard Nixon could have imagined , and a certain " base " will stick with Donald Trump no matter how little he does to protect the health and safety of his fellow citizens . <p> Still , it 's what we might call an " inconvenient truth . " How significant it turns out to be will depend on the actions of others at many levels of the judiciary , and the rest of the government . <p> This is yet another test for our democratic system , and the rule of law , facing existential challenges with no clear outcome in sight . And that 's almost as scary as the virus . <p> Douglas Rooks , a Maine editor , reporter , opinion writer and author for 35 years , has published books about George Mitchell , and the Maine Democratic Party .

But Beale wanted an answer to the question that Mayor Lori Lightfoot has so far refused to answer . <p> How big a hole has the pandemic blown in Lightfoot 's precariously-balanced , $11.6 billion budget ? How much revenue will reluctant aldermen have to find -- either by cutting the budget or raising taxes ? <p> " We know that it will be several hundreds of millions of dollars .

@@31845741 <h> The Ecology of Disease <p> THERE 'S a term biologists and economists use these days -- ecosystem services -- which refers to the many ways nature supports the human endeavor . Forests filter the water we drink , for example , and birds and bees pollinate crops , both of which have substantial economic as well as biological value . <p> If we fail to understand and take care of the natural world , it can cause a breakdown of these systems and come back to haunt us in ways we know little about . A critical example is a developing model of infectious disease that shows that most epidemics -- AIDS , Ebola , West Nile , SARS , Lyme disease and hundreds more that have occurred over the last several decades -- do n't just happen . They are a result of things people do to nature . <p> Disease , it turns out , is largely an environmental issue . Sixty percent of emerging infectious diseases that affect humans are zoonotic -- they originate in animals . And more than two-thirds of those originate in wildlife . <p> Teams of veterinarians and conservation biologists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and epidemiologists to understand the " ecology of disease . " It is part of a project called Predict , which is financed by the United States Agency for International Development . Experts are trying to figure out , based on how people alter the landscape -- with a new farm or road , for example -- where the next diseases are likely to spill over into humans and how to spot them when they do emerge , before they can spread . They are gathering blood , saliva and other samples from high-risk wildlife species to create a library of viruses so that if one does infect humans , it can be more quickly identified . And they are studying ways of managing forests , wildlife and livestock to prevent diseases from leaving the woods and becoming the next pandemic . <p> It is n't only a public health issue , but an economic one . The World Bank has estimated that a severe influenza pandemic , for example , could cost the world economy $3 trillion . <p> The problem is exacerbated by how livestock are kept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals . A study released earlier this month by the International Livestock Research Institute found that more than two million people a year are killed by diseases that spread to humans from wild and domestic animals . <p> The Nipah virus in South Asia , and the closely related Hendra virus in Australia , both in the genus of henipah viruses , are the most urgent examples of how disrupting an ecosystem can cause disease . The viruses originated with flying foxes , Pteropus vampyrus , also known as fruit bats . They are messy eaters , no small matter in this scenario . They often hang upside down , looking like Dracula wrapped tightly in their membranous wings , and eat fruit by masticating the pulp and then spitting out the juices and seeds . <p> The bats have evolved with henipah over millions of years , and because of this co-evolution , they experience little more from it than the fruit bat equivalent of a cold . But once the virus breaks out of the bats and into species that have n't evolved with it , a horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural Malaysia . It is likely that a bat dropped a piece of chewed fruit into a piggery in a forest . The pigs became infected with the virus , and amplified it , and it jumped to humans . It was startling in its lethality . Out of 276 people infected in Malaysia , 106 died , and many others suffered permanent and crippling neurological disorders . There is no cure or vaccine . Since then there have been 12 smaller outbreaks in South Asia . <p> In Australia , where four people and dozens of horses have died of Hendra , the scenario was different : suburbanization lured infected bats that were once forest-dwellers into backyards and pastures . If a henipah virus evolves to be transmitted readily through casual contact , the concern is that it could leave the jungle and spread throughout Asia or the world . " Nipah is spilling over , and we are observing these small clusters of cases -- and it 's a matter of time that the right strain will come along and efficiently spread among people , " says Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York-based organization that studies the ecological causes of disease . <p> That 's why experts say it 's critical to understand underlying causes . " Any emerging disease in the last 30 or 40 years has come about as a result of encroachment into wild lands and changes in demography , " says Peter Daszak , a disease ecologist and the president of EcoHealth . <p> Emerging infectious diseases are either new types of pathogens or old ones that have mutated to become novel , as the flu does every year . AIDS , for example , crossed into humans from chimpanzees in the 1920s when bush-meat hunters in Africa killed and butchered them . <p> Diseases have always come out of the woods and wildlife and found their way into human populations -- the plague and malaria are two examples . But emerging diseases have quadrupled in the last half-century , experts say , largely because of increasing human encroachment into habitat , especially in disease " hot spots " around the globe , mostly in tropical regions . And with modern air travel and a robust market in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large population centers is enormous . <p> The key to forecasting and preventing the next pandemic , experts say , is understanding what they call the " protective effects " of nature intact . In the Amazon , for example , one study showed an increase in deforestation by some 4 percent increased the incidence of malaria by nearly 50 percent , because mosquitoes , which transmit the disease , thrive in the right mix of sunlight and water in recently deforested areas . Developing the forest in the wrong way can be like opening Pandora 's box . These are the kinds of connections the new teams are unraveling . <p> Public health experts have begun to factor ecology into their models . Australia , for example , has just announced a multimillion-dollar effort to understand the ecology of the Hendra virus and bats . <p> IT 'S not just the invasion of intact tropical landscapes that can cause disease . The West Nile virus came to the United States from Africa but spread here because one of its favored hosts is the American robin , which thrives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which spread the disease , find robins especially appealing . " The virus has had an important impact on human health in the United States because it took advantage of species that do well around people , " says Marm Kilpatrick , a biologist at the University of California , Santa Cruz . The pivotal role of the robin in West Nile has earned it the title " super spreader . " <p> And Lyme disease , the East Coast scourge , is very much a product of human changes to the environment : the reduction and fragmentation of large contiguous forests . Development chased off predators -- wolves , foxes , owls and hawks . That has resulted in a fivefold increase in white-footed mice , which are great " reservoirs " for the Lyme bacteria , probably because they have poor immune systems . And they are terrible groomers . When possums or gray squirrels groom , they remove 90 percent of the larval ticks that spread the disease , while mice kill just half . " So mice are producing huge numbers of infected nymphs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When we do things in an ecosystem that erode biodiversity -- we chop forests into bits or replace habitat with agricultural fields -- we tend to get rid of species that serve a protective role , " Dr. Ostfeld told me . " There are a few species that are reservoirs and a lot of species that are not . The ones we encourage are the ones that play reservoir roles . " <p> Dr. Ostfeld has seen two emerging diseases -- babesiosis and anaplasmosis -- that affect humans in the ticks he studies , and he has raised the alarm about the possibility of their spread . <p> The best way to prevent the next outbreak in humans , specialists say , is with what they call the One Health Initiative -- a worldwide program , involving more than 600 scientists and other professionals , that advances the idea that human , animal and ecological health are inextricably linked and need to be studied and managed holistically . <p> " It 's not about keeping pristine forest pristine and free of people , " says Simon Anthony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Columbia University 's Mailman School of Public Health . " It 's learning how to do things sustainably . If you can get a handle on what it is that drives the emergence of a disease , then you can learn to modify environments sustainably . " <p> The scope of the problem is huge and complex . Just an estimated 1 percent of wildlife viruses are known . Another major factor is the immunology of wildlife , a science in its infancy . Raina K. Plowright , a biologist at Pennsylvania State University who studies the ecology of disease , found that outbreaks of the Hendra virus in flying foxes in rural areas were rare but were much higher in urban and suburban animals . She hypothesizes that urbanized bats are sedentary and miss the frequent exposure to the virus they used to get in the wild , which kept the infection at low levels . That means more bats -- whether from poor nutrition , loss of habitat or other factors -- become infected and shed more of the virus into backyards . <p> THE fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Predict . EcoHealth and its partners -- the University of California at Davis , the Wildlife Conservation Society , the Smithsonian Institution and Global Viral Forecasting -- are looking at wildlife-borne viruses across the tropics , building a virus library . Most of the work focuses on primates , rats and bats , which are most likely to carry diseases that affect people . <p> Most critically , Predict researchers are watching the interface where deadly viruses are known to exist and where people are breaking open the forest , as they are along the new highway from the Atlantic to the Pacific across the Andes in Brazil and Peru . " By mapping encroachment into the forest you can predict where the next disease could emerge , " Dr. Daszak , EcoHealth 's president , says . " So we 're going to the edge of villages , we 're going to places where mines have just opened up , areas where new roads are being built . We are going to talk to people who live within these zones and saying , ' what you are doing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to people about how they butcher and eat bush meat or to those who are building a feed lot in bat habitat . In Bangladesh , where Nipah broke out several times , the disease was traced to bats that were raiding containers that collected date palm sap , which people drank . The disease source was eliminated by placing bamboo screens ( which cost 8 cents each ) over the collectors . <p> EcoHealth also scans luggage and packages at airports , looking for imported wildlife likely to be carrying deadly viruses . And they have a program called PetWatch to warn consumers about exotic pets that are pulled out of the forest in disease hot spots and shipped to market . <p> All in all , the knowledge gained in the last couple of years about emerging diseases should allow us to sleep a little easier , says Dr. Epstein , the EcoHealth veterinarian . " For the first time , " he said , " there is a coordinated effort in 20 countries to develop an early warning system for emerging zoonotic outbreaks . "

Quick fix ' workarounds ' set up before the level 4 lockdown may have got your team online ... but is your team as productive as they were before ? <p> To improve efficiencies and restore workflows you often need to find new ways of doing tasks : for example , digitising activities normally done on paper , implementing e-signatures , or finding a different tool to track employee output . <h> Inability to effectively communicate <p> If staff are used to working in the office with an internal phone system , or desks near to one another , moving to remote working can mean all these communication processes ( between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some companies get stuck using multiple communication systems . For example , they may use cell phone calls for some clients , calls to the main offline line for others , and calls to DDIs for the remainder . This is scattered and inefficient . <p> The worst case scenario is when clients or customers are unable to reach staff through the main office line and resort to using mobile phone calls . If a client phone call is sent to a personal mobile voicemail , the company appears less professional . Mobile phone calls also are not easily transferred between team members . <p> The best solution for these communication and presence issues related to remote working is a unified communications platform . A unified communication platform enables all communication between clients/customers and staff to go through a centralised platform -- including voice calls , chat , conferences and screen sharing to enable integration with outlook calendar meetings and your CRM . ( We made an explainer video here to show how this works ) <h> Security concerns <p> When staff are working remotely ( especially if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own personal devices -- this is called ' Bring Your Own Device ' or ' BYOD ' . <p> BYOD is inherently difficult to manage in terms of security . It 's also hard for businesses to manage their employee 's hardware due to privacy issues . <p> You should be asking your staff : <p> * Do you have professional anti-virus protection installed ( and maintained ) on your devices ? <p> * Do you use a secure password ? <p> * Will other people be using the device ? <p> If a business expects staff to work on personal hardware to complete work tasks , a robust BYOD policy is essential to mitigate risks . This BYOD policy should cover : <p> * The tools or applications that employees may access on their personal devices <p> * The employer 's rights in respect of access to data contained on personal devices <p> * Resetting home router passwords ( because these are usually insecure ) <p> * How the various risks associated with the use of personal devices are shared and mitigated . <p> There are still extra security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too -- and remote working is always less secure than working within a more secure network as you would in the office . <p> Unsuitable infrastructure for remote work <p> A general reliance on on-site infrastructure can present significant challenges when working remotely . If this is the case for your business , you may need to change your IT infrastructure . <p> For example , you may have a set-up where : <p> * Your CRM ( customer relationship management ) systems are available only from in the office <p> * You ca n't access files remotely , as all are stored on desktops and local hard drives <p> There are several cloud-based storage solutions that enable easy storage in the cloud , including Dropbox , OneDrive , or Google Drive . If you 're already using Office 365 or Microsoft 365 , you may actually be paying for a license that includes a suitable product ! <p> It is key to review all the functionalities of your current subscriptions to see whether there is a viable solution in there to solve your infrastructure issues . <h> Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up perfectly , if your home/remote work network is not , there will be speed and staff productivity issues . Poor network infrastructure may even mean staff are unable to access company tools and data . You may need to upgrade your staff to ultra-fast broadband . <p> Another issue is that using a VPN connection from home to tap into the work server ( a common remote-work solution ) can give you a slow experience , whether or not you have ultra-fast broadband ! <p> If you have ultra-fast broadband installed but still suffer from slow internet speeds , you may require a signal boost , which can be achieved with an enterprise-quality wireless access point or physical cabling improvements . <p> Stay connectedas a team <p> Staying connected with staff is essential . It 's important to keep touchpoints with the team when they are working remotely so they have similar experiences as in the office . <h> H2 : Get the right advice <p> Clearly , there are a lot of moving parts when it comes to optimising business infrastructure and operations for remote work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to make the right decisions around software , hardware , cyber-security , communication platforms , and cloud solutions . <p> Understanding what needs to be changed in your IT infrastructure , and what systems and products will work best for your business , can be time-consuming -- and if you make the wrong decisions it can be a costly exercise . <p> If you are going to move to the cloud and set up a robust remote work plan , you 've got some complex decisions to make . Do n't rush the process , get the right advice , and do it thoughtfully ; you can implement step-by-step instead of making broad sweeping changes .

It incorporates some of what it outlined in its More Roads roadmap of two years ago , but now focuses more on key markets and products that drive the bike maker 's profitability and growth potential . <p> While Harley-Davidson is n't giving up on its electric motorcycle dreams , noting it will continue to advance their development , the plan calls for the company to return its focus to what made its brand great while narrowing where it makes investments . Notably , it calls for " building on Harley-Davidson 's strong position in the U.S. " <h> Going back to basics <p> That seems like a marked departure from the vision former CEO Matt Levatich had guided the company toward , as he saw international growth as Harley 's future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " profitable iconic motorcycles to excite existing customers , " even as it remains committed to its new middleweight bikes , the Pan American adventure touring bike and the Bronx streetfighter motorcycle . <p> The investments call for focusing on the markets that offer the most potential and the motorcycle models that can sell , and creating a corporate structure that once again takes into account its dealers , which have long been the heart of the company 's sales efforts , but which were often seemingly ignored under Levatich 's more top-down managing style . <p> The Rewire strategy is certainly no magical elixir to change what 's been ailing Harley-Davidson , and Zeitz 's earnings statement acknowledges that " COVID-19 has dramatically changed our business environment and it is critical we respond with agility to this new reality .

We expect the retail segment 's same-store sales growth to pick up from 2HFY21 once the curfew imposed at end-March 2020 is relaxed to a larger extent . The majority of RICH 's supermarkets , which are in the Western Province , were closed till 11 May due to the curfew . RICH conducted its sales through online , and call and order channels in the Western Province but sales were around 30% of normal levels . Stores have been allowed to reopen , but footfall may not normalise immediately due to continued social distancing requirements . <p> We expect consumer spending patterns on essential items such as food and beverage , grocery items and personal and homecare to regularise starting 2HFY20 resulting in a gradual normalisation of foot fall and basket sizes . <p> However the supermarket chain will continue to see weakness in certain product categories such as furniture and electronics as consumers defer such purchases . <p> Retail revenues should also benefit from new store openings in 2020 which will start contributing meaningfully from 2HFY21 . Recovery in Plantation : We expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover in FY21 , benefitting from better volumes across all crops and pricing improvements in tea and palm oil . Demand for tea has been rising in the past few months amid consumer preference for hot beverages since the pandemic and supply disruptions in India . <p> This , together with local currency depreciation , has led to a material price increase at the Colombo tea auctions . RICH 's tea volume should also improve in FY21 due to the resumption of the use of pesticides and weedicides , which were banned for a few years . Volatility in global demand and prices remains a significant risk to our forecast for the sector . <p> RICH 's palm-oil volume should benefit in the medium term from an increasing number of trees entering the higher yielding age bracket . The local palm-oil sector benefits from tariffs on imports and local palm-oil prices are rising due to increased import tariffs and the weakening local exchange rate , which offsets our expectations of a decline in global palm-oil prices . We expect the plantation sector to contribute around LKR600 million in EBITDA in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Exports : RICH 's export segment ( 20% of group EBIT ) will face a significant revenue impact from the COVID-19 . In FY20 , the segment derived a majority of revenue from North America and Europe , which are severely affected by the pandemic . <p> Consequently , we expect demand for RICH 's premium-priced latex mattresses to remain weak for a prolonged period . RICH is planning to shift some of its sales to the fast-growing Chinese market , but we expect demand to remain sluggish even in China despite early signs of economic recovery . The export segment also derives modest revenue from rubber rings used in the food business , and we expect this revenue to be resilient during the downturn . <p> Turnaround in Tyre Sales : RICH 's retreading business 's market position has improved further due to the exit of its main competitor last year .

This should drive demand for retreading in the short-to-medium term . Customers in the transport and logistics sectors that account for the majority of RICH 's retreading sales should continue to spend on fleet maintenance to support their livelihoods . <p> However , RICH was able to move to a leaner cost structure in FY20 by adopting cost effective sourcing strategies and rationalising some of its fixed costs , which should help defend margins in a downturn . Its export , plastic and tyre segments have variable cost structures and around 30% of fixed costs such as electricity can also be contained when plant-utilisation levels are low . The company is also <p> introducing cost-cutting measures at the group level , including pay cuts , which we estimate will amount to around 1% of FY21 revenue . <p> Leverage Increase Manageable : We forecast RICH 's leverage , defined as net adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR ( excluding its finance subsidiary ) , will rise to 3.0x in FY21 amid the weak operating environment . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes steps to preserve cash .

We expect net leverage to fall to around 2.7x after FY21 on stronger cash flow generation across all segments . Our forecasts factor in capital injections into RICH 's finance subsidiary in FY21 and FY22 to meet its regulatory capital requirements . <p> DERIVATION SUMMARY <p> RICH is a diversified conglomerate with exposure to both defensive sectors and growth markets . The company is rated two notches below domestic healthcare and consumer company Hemas Holdings PLC ( AA-(lka)/Stable ) , and Lion Brewery ( Ceylon ) PLC ( AA-(lka)/Stable ) , the country 's leading brewer , to reflect RICH 's higher exposure to cyclical end-markets and the capital infusions required at its weak finance subsidiary , which increase its business risks . <p> Sunshine Holdings PLC ( A-(lka)/Stable ) , another domestic conglomerate , is rated one notch below RICH to reflect its smaller operating scale due to competing in somewhat niche markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pharmaceuticals , which more than offset Sunshine 's lower leverage . <p> KEY ASSUMPTIONS <p> Revenue decline of 17% in FY21 , driven by a 50% decline in exports , 30% in plastics and 17% in supermarkets , mitigated by a 10% increase in plantations .

For the most part , things have been going very well , meaning no one has murdered anyone yet , although I am sure one of them is plotting my demise as I type this . <p> At first , I had grand plans for how we might pass the time in convivial and entertaining ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightly meal , followed by movies , games , or Bordeaux-fueled charades by the fire . Things did n't quite work out that way . Instead , here 's what our typical day looks like . <h> 7 a.m . GMT <p> Within moments of Felicity and I awakening , our 5-year-old is in our room . It 's not clear how he knows we 're awake . For all we know , he has a monitor like the one we use to listen to his 2-year-old sister . He waltzes over to my wife 's side of the bed , completely ignoring me as usual , and begins to chat with her about nothing and everything . ( His usual topic is dragons , as he is obsessed with the book series How to Train Your Dragon and its various cinematic spin-offs . ) Felicity and I head to the bathroom , and he follows and perches himself on the bidet to regale us with plot points from the novels and observations about the seemingly endless variety of dragons and their specific attributes . He will carry on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we head to his sister 's room , where she has been " singing " in her crib and perusing the shredded remains of her extensive Peppa Pig book collection . When she sees us enter , she inevitably covers her face with a book and pretends to be asleep . She thinks this is funny . She is right . I change her nappy and she kicks me in the groin a few times for my trouble . <p> We all head downstairs for breakfast . For me , this consists of a double espresso , orange juice , and a bowl of cereal with a banana and almond milk . I also choke down a handful of vitamins , including D3 , K2 , C , B12 , curcumin powder , and joint supplements so my knees do n't crack like a melting glacier every time I bend down to pick up a rogue Lego . Felicity has her tea and the children have toast , cereal , fruit , the occasional egg , or whatever else their little hearts desire . Most of their food ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep clean of the day . <h> 8 a.m . <p> I tidy up their mess , empty the dishwashers ( yes , we have two ) , scour the counters , wipe down the cabinets and their handles , and organize the contents of the fridge , discarding anything past its due date . I also sweep the floor , but after summoning considerable willpower decide to delay the mopping for after lunch . <p> As you might glean , I am a very tidy person . I actually like to clean , as I find it soothing . But I have gone a bit above and beyond during lockdown . The other day , it occurred to me that I might be able to strap a vacuum to my back like a leaf blower so that it could be with me at all times . <h> 8:45 a.m . <p> Felicity and I do an online workout with a friend of ours who is a Pilates teacher . The night before , we asked one of the older children to come down this morning and babysit . Seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face still swollen from sleep , and grunts a " Good morning " as we flee to the living room for a fitness-filled escape from reality . During this time , I think about what we might cook that evening for eight people yet again . <h> 9:45 a.m . <p> When the session ends , Felicity and I go over what food items need to be restocked . With four people ages 18 to 20 , the amount of food , beer , and wine consumed is staggering . If there is a shortage of avocados at the local stores , it 's because we 've eaten them all . If there is no Kerrygold butter left in the United Kingdom , it 's because it 's either in our freezer or we ate it . All of it . Just fucking ate it . Probably without even spreading it on anything . I saw a neighbor hungrily eyeing our cat yesterday and it occurred to me that the woman probably had n't eaten meat in a week , because my gluttonous family had devoured all of the fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pork , rabbit , and game in Southwest London . Still gasping for breath from an unnecessarily grueling workout , I rummage through the fridge . <p> Given our short supplies , I decide to make something simple tonight : pasta alla Norma and saut ? ed lamb chops . I reckon that these two dishes should satisfy everyone 's palate and nutritional needs . However , I know that my middle daughter will eat only the pasta dish , as she is now a vegetarian . What timing . <p> In a very large frying pan , fry the garlic in some of the oil for about two minutes . Add the eggplant and cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes , until it is slightly golden . Salt to taste . When the eggplant is cooked , add the marinara sauce and cook together for about five minutes . Drain the pasta , reserving ? cup of the water . Stir the reserved pasta water into the pan mixture and sprinkle with the basil . Remove four cups of the sauce and put it into a serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of the sauce and gently stir it all together . Serve and sprinkle with grated ricotta salata or pecorino. <h> 10:30 a.m . <p> After doing some homeschooling with the 5-year-old , Felicity heads upstairs to shower and begin her remote workday from our bedroom . She is a literary agent and carries out her endless meetings via Zoom . With the exception of finishing voice-over work from my studio for a CNN series I recently completed , I have very little to do these days , as film and TV production have shut down . As far as I know , this has never happened since somebody first called " Action ! " more than 100 years ago . <p> So I do the laundry and play with the kids -- often made-up games such as Mean King , in which I affect a very posh British accent and they come to me to " pay their taxes " and then " steal " them back when I " take a nap . " I like this game because I get to sit on my " throne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seating device ever designed . I try to drag the game out for as long as possible so I do n't have to get up , but the 2-year-old is beginning to reek and I realize that I have been neglectful in my nappy-changing duties . <p> When this wrestling match has ended and she has accused everyone in the house ( besides herself ) of pooping , I change them both out of their pajamas and into the outfit of the day . Although the 5-year-old can dress himself , today he insists that he is incapable of doing so . I therefore talk him through each stage while the 2-year-old hurtles herself through the room , screaming with laughter and jeering at me . I finally catch her , body-slam her to the sofa , and stuff her into her first of many outfits of the day , like sausage meat into a casing . My glasses are nowhere to be found , and therefore I ca n't see well enough to work the minuscule fucking buttons on children 's clothing , so I leave part of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She does n't . But I do and it plagues me for the rest of the day. ) <h> 11 a.m . <p> Once the children are dressed , I usher them into the garden , where they bounce on the trampoline and beg me to allow them to play with the hose . Sometimes I will bounce or " wrestle " with them for a bit , and this makes them very happy . It has the same effect on me as well . After a while , I finally relent and allow them some water play , with a hose , buckets , and a miniature plastic kitchen set . <p> With the kids sufficiently distracted , I head inside and begin cooking , keeping an eye on them from the kitchen window . I first decide to make chicken stock with leftover carcasses . <p> SIMPLE CHICKEN STOCK <p> 1 chicken carcass and a whole chicken without breast meat , or two of each <p> 10 mixed peppercorns <p> 1 yellow onion -- cut in half , skin on <p> 1 red onion -- cut in half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on <p> 2 celery stalks -- quartered <p> 2 carrots -- quartered <p> A handful of parsley <p> 2 bay leaves <p> A fair amount of salt <p> 1 sprig of rosemary <p> 2 sprigs of thyme <p> Break down the chicken , place in a stockpot , and cover with water . Bring to a boil and skim off the scum that rises to the top . Add the other ingredients and cook slightly covered for as long as you want , at least two hours . Strain through a sieve into some sort of vessel and refrigerate or put into freezer bags and freeze . <h> 12:15 p.m . <p> The older generation of children awakens . They enter the kitchen and make quick work of an entire loaf of bread , two pints of cherry tomatoes , four avocados , six eggs , two pints of blueberries , four bananas , 20 rashers of bacon , one liter of almond milk , six Nespresso pods , and a liter of orange juice before retreating to the TV room or their bedrooms , where they tell me they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I do n't . Felicity comes down and serves the little ones lunch after I have changed their waterlogged clothes . I am off to clean a bathroom or two , do some more laundry , or vacuum something that I just vacuumed three hours before . <h> 1:45 p.m . <p> Felicity puts the 2-year-old down for her nap , the 5-year-old listens to his audiobook , and I make marinara and prep the eggplant for the pasta alla Norma. <h> 3 p.m . <p> When all is prepped and the kitchen is cleaned once again , it is my intention to write something , read , or catch up on emails . Instead I pick up the New York Times crossword puzzle to clear my head , and promptly fall asleep . <h> 3:30 p.m . <p> I awaken with spittle on my chin and too few clues answered . Glancing at my watch , I rush upstairs to awaken the 2-year-old from her nap . When I arrive , Felicity is already changing her while doing a conference call . I know she wants to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person than that . I take the child , finish the diapering , redress her , and head downstairs . I give both children a snack and we play together in the garden . We bounce on the trampoline , do chalk drawings on the patio , look for slugs , and maybe do some drawing or painting . It is at once lovely and exhausting . We are laughing one moment and the next someone is weeping and I am adjudicating , saying things such as : <p> " Let her have it for a few minutes and then you can have it . " <p> " What 's a few ? " <p> " A few is three . " <p> " Three minutes ? " <p> " Yes , three minutes . And then you can have it . " <p> " Will you time it ? " <p> " Yes , I will time it .

Pour into a coupe . Garnish with half of an orange slice . Drink . <h> 5 p.m . <p> The older children have now come downstairs to eat an entire fucking meal before dinner . Thankfully , as penance , two of them take the little ones up for their bath . Felicity enters the kitchen and begs for a Negroni . I gladly make her one , as I hate to drink alone , although I have been known to make near-daily exceptions . And anyway , one is never really drinking alone . Someone else is drinking somewhere .

Remove the lamb chops from the pan and set them aside on a platter . Add a splash of white wine to the pan , and perhaps a little water , and deglaze .

This is the last time . " <p> And it is . Until tomorrow . <h> 7:45 p.m . <p> Felicity and I cook dinner for ourselves and the four other human locusts , and eat standing around the kitchen island because we ca n't be bothered to set the table anymore . We eat , drink wine , and comment on the food , but this past week we barely spoke with one another . This makes me sad , as I know it 's because we are all lost in our own anxieties .

Only a couple of miles away in any direction there are hospitals chock-full of ill and dying patients who are being attended to by overworked and overwhelmed National Health Service doctors , nurses , and support staff .

The camp is perhaps the first Jewish camp in the country to announce , in detail , how it plans to open . ( Courtesy of Camp Modin ) <p> ( JTA ) -- Here 's a story that would have been unremarkable until just a few months ago : A Jewish camp is planning to open this summer . <p> Camp Modin in Maine has announced that it will open July 9 -- two weeks later than originally planned -- despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic . And it has set out a detailed plan to make it happen . <p> " COVID is something that 's going to be with us for the foreseeable future , " said Howard Salzberg , the camp 's co-director with his wife , Lisa Wulkan Salzberg . " The children have lost in-person learning and they have lost art and they have lost sports and being part of a team . How long is that acceptable for children ? We felt we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to normalcy and to mitigate the risk as best we can . " <p> Dozens of Jewish summer camps across the country have announced that they will not be running this year because of the danger of spreading the disease and the challenge of navigating murky regulations . But Maine has allowed overnight camps to open beginning July 1 and plans to release detailed instructions for them on May 20 , and other camps in the state have also said they will open . <p> Modin is perhaps the first Jewish camp to tell parents definitively that it will open , and to specifically describe how it will keep campers and counselors safe . <p> Modin plans to test every camper for the disease via at-home test kits before they arrive , and again throughout the summer . The camp has consulted on its measures with epidemiologists and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and will expand its medical staff this summer . And it has laid out a list of measures aimed at ensuring campers ' safety -- from abolishing a buffet line for meals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday said the camp relied on " facts not emotion " while making the decision , and said the disease " does not adversely affect children and young healthy adults .

" Staff will be there and wo n't be leaving the camp . They wo n't be leaving the camp to do outside activities , so everything will be happening at camp .

Modin serves around 300 campers each summer -- a number that Salzberg said will stay the same this year . <p> The camp 's decision runs counter to those made by large American Jewish camp networks , which have announced -- or are in the process of announcing -- summer cancellations either because their states do not allow them to open or they are afraid that the coronavirus will spread in their camps and endanger campers , staff and others . <p> Modin 's list of measures to ensure those things do n't happen include holding campwide gatherings in large open areas , where groups of campers can socially distance ; serving meals table by table rather than having campers line up at a buffet ; using only disposable plates and silverware ; and closing communal bathrooms . <p> Staff will be tested before they arrive and will be at camp " well in advance of the campers , " according to the email to parents . <p> The email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight arranged by the camp , whereupon camp staff would pick them up at the airport . Should parents drive their kids to camp , they will have to drop them off at a staging area outside the camp gates . Buses or vans will be available only from the nearby city of Boston . International staff also will be working at the camp . <p> Also , the email said the camp would consider sticking to bunk activities for the summer and smaller outings as opposed to full camp trips to outside locations like an amusement park . <p> Is social distancing possible in the freewheeling atmosphere of camp ? <p> Salzberg said that kids would be safer in the contained environment of camp than they would be running around a public park or beach . Even so , he said , the camp will have to impress on kids that they ca n't be nearly as uninhibited as they are in a normal year , and will have to emphasize that no plan is foolproof . <p> " We have said to families , no matter what procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Salzberg said . " You 're going to have to have an understanding with your campers and staff that it 's going to be a different summer . I do n't think there 's a parent that can guarantee you that their child , from now until they go back to school , there 's going to be no slip-ups . " <p> Salzberg added that if everyone tests negative for COVID-19 multiple times after a few weeks , the rules could be relaxed . He even floated the idea of a socially distanced bar mitzvah party for the kids who had to celebrate the coming-of-age ceremony virtually this year . <p> The camp has managed outbreaks of other diseases in the past , Salzberg said . Most recently , in 2009 , more than 130 Modin campers were infected with swine flu . It also experienced outbreaks of measles in 1992 and meningitis a few years later . <p> Salzberg recognizes that the risk of exposure to COVID-19 is more dire for those who are older than their 20s -- a group that includes himself , his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60s and has been working at Modin for decades .

@@31848341 <p> This brutal spring , the U.S. faces two great crises . Over the past 14 weeks , 84,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 . <p> That 's 28 times the death toll of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , more than the U.S. combat deaths in the Vietnam War , and one-quarter of the total global casualties from the coronavirus pandemic . At the same time , the national lockdown designed to halt the spread of the disease has pushed 33 million Americans out of work , forced hundreds of thousands of small-business owners to board up their shops and left 1 in 5 children uncertain where they 'll find their next meal . It 's the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , and with some economists forecasting unemployment to soar past 20% , a second one is a real concern . <p> As the death toll has rung out against a crescendo of economic despair , Americans have had no time to mourn . Instead , we have been pulled into an increasingly heated debate that pits those twin tragedies against each other . In exchange for our jobs , our livelihoods , the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear ? How many tens of thousands of lives are we willing to sacrifice so that the rest of us can work and live outside our homes ? Eager to juice the economy before the November election , President Donald Trump is pushing hard for businesses to reopen . But public-health officials are raising the alarm . On May 12 , infectious-disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci , a key member of Trump 's own coronavirus task force , told a Senate panel that easing social-distancing restrictions too swiftly risks " multiple outbreaks throughout the country " that will " result in needless suffering and death . " <p> It did n't have to be this way . There 's no reason the wealthiest country in the world -- the nation that re-built Europe , that went to the moon , that claims exceptionalism as its birthright -- should have to choose between economic resilience and protecting the lives of its most vulnerable citizens . Countries that acted more quickly to curb the spread of the virus have limited the damage on both fronts . In the early days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switzerland tested their populations at nearly 40 times the U.S. rate , per capita , and now have one-fifth the death rate . <p> Having failed in its initial response , the U.S. now risks risks making matters worse . Despite roughly 1,800 deaths per day of late , and rising infection rates in parts of the country , at least 41 states are easing restrictions or preparing to do so . In many cases , governors are plunging ahead with reopening despite failing to meet key benchmarks established by public-health officials . As a result , draft projections provided to the Federal Emergency Management Agency included a revised forecast for the virus 's toll , estimating some 3,000 Americans could be dying per day by June 1 -- a 9/11 every day . <h> Related Stories <p> To avoid these shocking death rates , Americans should look at what has worked elsewhere . Industrialized nations in Europe and Asia have begun opening up their economies by relying on continued social distancing , widespread testing , and a network of contact tracing to identify and contain new outbreaks . South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every new coronavirus case within its borders . Germany set the standard for preventative testing and an incremental , staged plan for reopening . <p> Experts at the American Enterprise Institute , Johns Hopkins University and elsewhere have laid out detailed steps like these . Together , they would help the U.S. track the spread of the disease in our communities ; clamp down on new outbreaks ; and arrive at data-driven decisions to facilitate a safe reopening . For now , our leaders are following their recommendations haphazardly at best . If we ca n't identify our missteps and learn from other countries ' successes and setbacks , we risk an even more catastrophic fall . <p> Illustration by Edel Rodriguez for TIME <p> We are making progress on some fronts . On May 11 , Trump declared that America has " prevailed " on testing . That 's not yet clear . But the U.S. is now conducting some 390,000 tests a day -- a major jump after a sluggish start . Admiral Brett Giroir , the federal official overseeing coronavirus-testing efforts , told lawmakers in May that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests every month to provide basic surveillance on the spread of the disease in this country , but it will take us at least until September to reach those numbers . So we are months behind . But still , the results of ramped-up testing bring cause for cautious optimism . Usually , the more people you test , the more confirmed cases you see , since you catch people who would n't normally be tested , including those who are asymptomatic or have just mild symptoms . But in recent weeks , we 've seen the opposite : the number of confirmed cases nationwide is declining . <p> Yet different areas are at different stages in the pandemic . New York and New Jersey are seeing declining numbers , but states in every part of the country , from California to Maine , have watched their infection rates climb . What 's more , the main reason the U.S. has begun to slow the spread of the virus is that most of the country has been under stay-at-home orders for nearly two months . Rolling back precisely those policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As states reopen , public-health officials insist that the only way to contain future outbreaks is through dogged disease surveillance . Officials must identify not only people who have been infected but also who they 've come in contact with . Yet the U.S. has so far failed to develop a comprehensive contact-tracing program . Despite congressional funding of $23 million per year since 2016 for biosurveillance and authorization last June of 30 positions for disease surveillance , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has yet to even hire for those roles . The pandemic " went beyond the capacity " of the agency 's contact-tracing program , CDC director Robert Redfield told lawmakers May 11 . <p> In the absence of a meaningful federal effort , state governments -- in partnership with universities , researchers and the National Guard -- have taken up the slack . California is now conducting contact tracing in 22 counties and plans eventually to deploy a force of 10,000 state employees . Maryland is partnering with the University of Chicago and a research organization to quadruple its contact-tracing capacity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning on their National Guards to help with similar efforts . <p> Still , these efforts are meager compared with those of other advanced nations . South Korea 's tech-powered contact-tracing program involves GPS-tracking of all new positive cases and wristbands for scofflaws . As a result , South Korean officials were able not only to immediately notice a new outbreak this month in Seoul , but to rapidly identify its source ( a 29-year-old man with COVID-19 had visited a series of nightclubs ) , determine the number of newly infected ( 102 ) and deduce the total number of possible new cases that had been in contact with the infected individuals ( 5,500 ) . The cluster was a setback for the nation of over 51 million , which is preparing to reopen its economy and schools . But it also marked something of a success story : officials demonstrated they can react rapidly to contain the virus and limit new outbreaks . <p> Germany , which has earned praise for its ambitious surveillance testing program , likewise offers a potentially useful road map . In recent weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain types of shops and restaurants to reopen with additional hygiene measures , like installing protection screens for staff and removing salt and pepper shakers from tables . " We can afford a little audacity , " Chancellor Angela Merkel dryly observed on May 6 . Limits on social contact will remain in place nationwide until June 5 , and even then citizens must wear face coverings and maintain roughly 5 ft. between one another . Meanwhile , public-health officials are randomly testing households and tracing new infections . <p> So if the way forward is clear , can the U.S. simply copy what 's working elsewhere ? The straightforward answer is no . Unlike in places like South Korea , there 's no national reopening plan in the U.S. Instead , 50 governors are charting their own paths . The White House and the CDC have released bare-bones guidance for reopening , but neither entity can dictate what states do ; they can only hope that governors choose the right course . <p> As of early May , that was n't happening . More than a dozen governors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very loosely , the Trump Administration 's nonbinding reopening guidelines , according to an Associated Press analysis . At least 17 states that are in the process of reopening , including Georgia , California , Florida , Massachusetts , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island and Texas , failed to meet the White House 's key metric for reopening : a downward trajectory of new cases or positive test rates for at least 14 days . <p> Much of the blame for that disarray falls on Trump himself . The President has repeatedly undermined the guidance of his own public-health officials , fomented antiquarantine protests on Twitter and politicized cautious positions taken by some governors . On May 7 , the AP reported that the Administration had " buried " more detailed CDC advice to states on how to safely reopen . <p> Trump 's erratic political response to the public-health crisis reflects his own leadership style , but also the larger challenge of America 's cultural idiosyncrasies . Americans are uniquely attached to our civil liberties . It 's difficult to imagine South Korea 's contact-tracing program -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movements of every citizen -- flying on U.S. soil . The same is true of Chinese officials ' reopening of Shanghai Disneyland . While the first day back at the Happiest Place on Earth was successful , attendees willingly scanned QR codes on their phones , allowing the government to monitor their exact where-abouts in case of future outbreaks . <p> It 's equally difficult to imagine Trump , with his disregard for science , embracing an incremental , data-driven approach to reopening . As Germany 's Merkel , a trained scientist , drew praise for her clear-eyed explanations for social distancing , Trump was publicly suggesting Americans might inject disinfectant . Merkel 's government has repeatedly urged wearing a mask in public ; Trump has refused to wear one at all , even during an outbreak in his own White House . Asked on May 6 whether reopening rapidly could lead to an explosion of new infections , the President was sanguine . " Hopefully that wo n't be the case , " Trump said , adding , " It could very well be the case . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome if its reopening is careful . The American mass testing program is just now getting off the ground , and many states ' contact-tracing programs are still in their infancy . We need time to get those programs up and running so that we can find new infections and halt outbreaks . <p> Taking it slow wo n't be easy . Americans will have to watch as the Germans and Australians and Japanese enjoy many of the freedoms this summer that we 're desperate to reclaim . And an incremental approach will come at an economic cost : the rosiest market projections require that Americans flee their houses the moment stay-at-home orders are lifted . <p> But that seems to be O.K. with most of us . Three out of four Americans say the U.S. should continue trying to slow the spread of the coronavirus , even if it means keeping many businesses closed , a recent Washington Post/Ipsos poll found . Even as America 's leaders call for an economic revival , there are signs citizens wo n't rush back to public life . <p> Which may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapple with the twin tragedies before us , perhaps America can , as it always has , forge its own path . <h> Thank you ! <p> For your security , we 've sent a confirmation email to the address you entered .

This is known to be the best route to language fluency . <p> To date , most applications of artificial intelligence ( AI ) that we 've seen emerge have been based on the approach of learning rules and exceptions to rules , using supervised machine learning .

Closing down data flows ( not communicating ) is not an option . Global businesses and , particularly in today 's pandemic , social interactions , require Internet-based communication . <p> So given that all data is connected and , to some extent , vulnerable to compromise , the challenge boils down to identifying malicious activity amid all the legitimate activity .

You can find copies of our SEC filings and earnings release , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call on our website at www.shpreit.com . <p> Thanks , Adam , and thank you all for joining us today for our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call . Yesterday , we reported first quarter results in our press release , including all standard comparable operating measures and financial metrics , which have been rendered largely irrelevant by the dramatic falloff in demand we saw in the middle of March as widespread closures were implemented to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus . <p> Therefore , we 're going to spend our time today , reinforcing the many proactive measures we took to combat the effects of the virus on our business , provide an update on the current operating environment , balance sheet , and look ahead to how we envision leading in the future . <p> Over the past two very challenging months , we have prioritized the health and safety of our guests , our brand and management company associates , and our own employees , and I 'm quite pleased with the resolve demonstrated by our team managing through this unprecedented crisis . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks and are genuinely grateful for both the concern for our well-being and the interest in our business . <p> As the depths of what is certain to be a historic downturn became apparent in March , we swiftly began implementing hotel-level contingency plans focused on right-sizing staffing levels and adjusting service amenity offerings to an exceptionally low occupancy environment . Fortunately , the efficient nature of our operating model has allowed us to keep all but six of our 72 hotels open with another nine hotels effectively consolidated into adjacent , typically dual-branded hotels . <p> The hotels that remain open are operating with very limited staff and providing only the very basic service and amenity offerings . We have suspended all nonessential capital expenditures for the remainder of the year , along with common dividend distributions , which combined , will preserve over $100 million of cash on an annualized basis . We have also taken additional measures at the corporate office , implementing temporary base salary reductions for the majority of our employees and furloughing approximately 25% of the staff . <p> We were very pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jon will provide more details on the agreement shortly , but this amendment provides us with an additional $150 million of undrawn funding capacity , a full financial covenant waiver for 12 months and a modified covenant package beyond those initial 12 months that creates considerable flexibility and runway for our business to recover . <p> As I mentioned , the majority of our hotels remain open today , and despite the incredibly challenging conditions , we are pleased to have found some level of stabilization over the last few weeks . Preliminary April results for our portfolio point to RevPAR declining approximately 89% compared to last year , including results from hotels that were closed or consolidated during the month . <p> However , occupancy levels were four full percentage points higher in the second half of the month compared to the first as certain brand initiatives , including first responder rate programs and our own internal revenue management strategies , prove successful in capitalizing unlimited opportunities . While high teens occupancy levels may seem trivial , I would remind you that even with 90% year-over-year RevPAR declines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn rate from $15 million to $11 million per month . <p> With nearly $300 million of current liquidity , we have well over two years of capital to survive very draconian and thankfully , highly unlikely operating scenario . While we are all facing what is undoubtedly an uncertain future in road recovery , we also believe this will ultimately provide unique opportunities for value creation . We generally share in the emerging consensus that leisure travel broadly and drive to leisure demand more specifically will be the first and fastest segment of business to recover . <p> We stand well positioned to benefit from such a recovery as our efficient operating model has afforded us important flexibility to remain open at the vast majority of our hotels and a clear pathway to relatively quick reramp of business . Approximately 50% of our pre-crisis business mix was leisure oriented , while group business , particularly large groups and international demand , make up a disproportionately small portion of our customer base . <p> Before I turn the call over to Jon , I would like to make a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they have responded in a constructive manner . As you are probably well aware , the major brand companies have implemented several measures to help support owners through the crisis , including the postponement of brand-mandated capital plans , access to and utilization of FF&amp;E reserve funds for operating expenses , fee relief and the suspension of some brand standards and quality control audits . <p> More importantly , we have collaboratively begun the very important process of addressing the future operating standards of our business , one in which cleanliness , hygiene and sanitation will undoubtedly take on a more prominent role . Our belief is a watershed event like this gives us a rare opportunity to address meaningful shortcomings and implement important changes to the day-to-day operations of our hotels . <p> While we are in the very early stages of redefining our model , we remain committed to finding solutions that enhance the long-term profitability of our hotels and delivering on guest evolving and likely elevated expectations . <p> Thanks , Dan , and good morning , everyone . In yesterday 's press release , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which includes our $600 million senior credit facility as well as two $225 million term loan facilities that are governed by the same set of financial covenants , and thus were modified in essentially identical ways . <p> Importantly , these amendments allow for the outright waiver of testing of financial covenants through the first quarter of 2021 and modified covenant thresholds , along with annualized testing mechanisms in the last three quarters of 2021 to accommodate what may be a more gradual recovery in our business . We have an ability to draw an additional $150 million under the revised terms of our revolving credit facility , giving us nearly $300 million of total liquidity , including approximately $145 million of unrestricted cash currently on hand . <p> This gives us not only considerable capacity to survive an extended period generating extremely limited revenue , but flexibility to operate in a potentially longer downturn and slower recovery scenario . We also broadly preserved our ability to continue making preferred dividend payments and retained flexibility to renovate hotels in a manner more consistent with our past cadence once demand begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexibility , the credit facilities are now secured with pledges of equity from our borrower-based assets and includes certain restrictions on uses of cash during the waiver period , including investments , common dividend distributions and share repurchases . The amendments to these facilities address more than 80% of our current debt balance , and when combined with an absence of debt maturities until November of 2022 , position our balance sheet well to withstand the financial ramifications of a severe decline in revenues . <p> Today , our weighted average interest rate is 3.4% and weighted average term to maturity of nearly four years . We are truly grateful for the support we received from our bank group and proud that our many strong relationships allowed us to work through this process efficiently and successfully . As Dan mentioned , our cash burn rate in a zero revenue scenario is approximately $15 million per month , which is split roughly evenly between covering operating losses at the hotel level and funding corporate cash needs , including all principal and interest payments , corporate G&amp;A , preferred dividend and nondiscretionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in occupancy levels in recent weeks , which is reducing our cash burn rate by over 25% and in turn , adding considerable runway to our liquidity profile even in this historically low demand environment . As our attention turns increasingly towards a recovery in demand and evaluating reopening the few hotels that are currently closed , we remain focused on adding back labor , services and amenities gradually and prudently . <p> Less than 10% of the total rooms in our portfolio are closed today , and the majority of those we are planning to reopen over the next 30 days , pending any further changes to local market conditions . Thankfully , our operating model has always relied on relatively less labor , and we believe there 's an opportunity at a minimum on an interim basis to operate with fewer FTEs at more normalized occupancy levels . <p> While revenues have declined dramatically across the industry , we have continued to gain market share despite the lack of traditional demand . Even before we begin to feel the effects of broad travel restrictions , we improved our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and February . Our 7.6% RevPAR index gain in March is likely somewhat skewed by hotel closures in certain markets , but nonetheless , we have been successful capitalizing on opportunities that currently exist , which speaks highly of our revenue management team and augurs well for our ability to reramp quickly . <p> Finally , we formally withdrew full year guidance ranges in the middle of March in response to the COVID-19 pandemic , and given the continued uncertainty in our business , we are not in a position to provide updated ranges for the remainder of the year . We will evaluate reinstating guidance as the operating environment continues to evolve over the coming months and quarters . <p> Do you guys have an estimate of maybe what percentage of the portfolio is drive to , fly to ? I know it 's not something you typically ask guests , but if you are looking at just the location of those hotels , is there any way to ballpark it ? <p> Chris , this is Dan . It 's a little hard to get an accurate estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can drive to as most , you can . I think what we see is some of the more traditional locations that maybe have n't been as much of a drive to market are starting to see some pickup as people may be looking at different modes of transportation , and they may be modifying their plans instead of flying somewhere to go somewhere where they can drive to , and that drive to market may have previously been a fly to market . <p> So , as we look at it , we think that all of our markets have a component that are visitable in this recovery period . I know that does n't specifically answer your percentage question , but it 's really -- there 's not a real specific metric that we get through our guests that we could use . <p> Yes . Yes . No , fair enough . I also wanted to ask you about kind of how you see rate integrity unfolding going forward , maybe if you look out to July or August ? Because I think we know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupancy , they have to use rate as a tool . Are you seeing any signs of more severe rate erosion as you look further out ? Or is it so far holding up pretty well ? <p> I think so far , it 's held up alright in light of the circumstances we 're sitting in . Forward-looking trends are really hard to have any sort of confidence in at this point . I 'm not sure how reliable demand forecasts are out beyond the next 30 days . So I think where we line up is that we expect to compete very well with our hotels in our immediate area , whether they 're in our comp set or not , for the factors that we 've been really positive on our portfolio for the last several years , which is they 're great boxes , great locations . They have an average effective age of a little over three years , so they 've been renovated , and I think that we believe will help us manage rate as best as possible . <p> Just wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really kind of better understand the RevPAR declines . Can you maybe give us a sense of how your urban versus suburban properties fared ? And then any particular markets that drag down the overall portfolio 's performance would be helpful . <p> Yes . Mike , it 's Jon . I would say March finished down for the portfolio about 60% . As you would imagine , I think we started to feel the effects in some of the urban markets more quickly than we did in suburban markets , San Francisco probably being the one market that stood out where we saw a more -- a quicker decline earlier . I think the trends , and Dan mentioned a little of this in the prepared remarks , I think the trends in April , which our hope will be kind of the worst month for in the first half of the month than they were in the second half of the month . The occupancy was a full four percentage points higher in the second half of April than it was in the first half of April . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburban portfolio outperformed the urban portfolio . We 've seen a continuation of that trend in slightly higher occupancy levels as we 've gotten in the first few weeks of May . <p> Got it . Helpful . And then just last one for me , probably for Jon . You mentioned $150 million of availability . What are the requirements for you to get that last $50 million ? It looks like there 's $100 million that 's kind of freely available , and then there 's a couple more steps you 'd have to take to get to that last $50 million . Can you walk us through the mechanics of that ? <p> Yes , sure . So the -- I think as we 've laid out , we drew $125 million of cash up and right around quarter end . So we 're sitting on $145 million of cash today . In addition to that , we preserved $150 million of incremental borrowing capacity under the facility . The first $100 million , it will be secured by pledges of equity of the borrowing base assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by outright mortgages on those borrowing-based assets . <p> Got it . So if you wanted , but for whatever reason , you found a use for that $50 million , you 'd have to go through the process . It 's a little bit more work to get that . It 's not as easy and efficient to get than the first $100 million , right ? <p> Yes , that 's right . I mean , I think the rationale for us was , one , I think for the banks , it 's obviously a significant credit enhancement . In our view , between the $145 million we have today and the incremental $100 million before that last $50 million gets us through , again , a pretty long period of time in a pretty draconian scenario with $300 million of liquidity and a RevPAR environment where we run even down 90% , which was kind of the worst month of the year in April . It gets us 27 , 28 months of total liquidity . So we 've got a fairly long runway . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 21 and ' 22 covenants at that point in time . So I think that the liquidity and even getting that last $50 million to the extent that the market dictates it , we do have to give mortgages , but we 've got a fair amount of runway before we get to that point . <p> First question , a lot of people have been talking about how this pandemic had kind of shifted or swung the pendulum back toward owners in the brand and owner sort of dynamic . I 'm just wondering , I 'd be interested to hear your thoughts in terms of what that kind of looks like in terms of -- or how you see that playing out in terms of fees , brand standard proliferation of new brands , and if you think that will lead to higher margins than you 've seen before when everything stabilizes . <p> Neil , it 's Dan . Look , I think the brands , as I stated in my prepared remarks , have been very much supportive of taking a hard look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made great progress in discussions on things that would help the operating model , but that would also meet the expectations , which are , as you would expect , likely elevated for guests . So I do think that on a broad scale that we will come out of this with an even better operating model to the extent that we can achieve peak margins , I think a lot of that will have to do with the speed at which rate recovers . But I 've actually been very pleased . I sit on a number of advisory boards with the brands , and they have been very much supportive of ways to help not just during this environment , but in evaluating a longer-term solution to some of the struggles we 've had from operations . <p> Appreciate that . Other one I have is what , I guess , portion of your portfolio is traditional extended stay versus the , I guess , just traditional select service ? And then are there anything that you 're seeing from COVID that would maybe make you change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy ? <p> It 's Dan again . The -- our portfolio is roughly between 20% and 25% extended stay . Look , we love that business . And should opportunities be available for those type of transactions , we would love to continue to grow that part of the portfolio . But we 're very much -- very methodical on our acquisition . The returns still have to be there . The entry point would have to be right ; locations would have to be right . So that would just be one of the factors we would look at and as we continue the evolution of our portfolio . <p> Okay . I guess last one for me . The mezz loans you have on the development , what have preliminary conversations been like with your partners based on the deterioration ? And any possibility of potentially that capital stack getting pushed down and you maybe wind up being the equity holder ? <p> Look , I think as far as our partners on the mezz loans , they 're very experienced developers . They 're properties in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a mechanism to push those out a year or even two . So that 's probably more likely the direction we 'd go with those . We have given them a forbearance for the next 3 months , which I think is appropriate given the current environment . But we still feel good about the long-term prospects of these particular properties . <p> I hope you have n't cut the utility bill at this point , but just into my first question here , in sort of a gradual occupancy ramp type scenario , how should we be thinking or what range of flow-through multiples should we be thinking about as you reramp costs and services over time ? <p> So yes , well , so as we think about RevPAR declines and how that flows through to hotel EBITDA decline , sort of a multiple of EBITDA decline to RevPAR decline , you guys were 1.7x , which stood out versus , I think , a lot of the peers being well north of 2 and even 3x , which maybe speaks to the efficiency of the operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there fairly well . And so as we think about a gradual occupancy ramp in the portfolio , maybe what type of multiple or flow-through should we think about on that incremental occupancy as you also reramp costs and services . <p> Yes . So I 'll take a first crack at this . So I think the way that we 've looked at it , when we looked at retention in March , our March retention was somewhere between kind of 30% and 35% . And I think March is probably our best indicator at this point , but really only half of the month is reflective of operating at what are kind of these very , very lean staffing models . I think April will be the better tale . We do n't have final April numbers yet . But my expectation is that the retention rates as we get through April , it would be somewhere in the kind of 35% to 40% range . So I think we 'll have pretty good retention . That probably implies that kind of somewhere between 1.5 and 2x EBITDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I think as we think about how revenues flow through going forward , a lot of it is going to be , as you know , the mix between kind of rates and occupancies . And we 're in a little bit of a unique circumstance here where this is a lot different scenario than going from normalized kind of RevPAR and growing those 2% , 3% , 5% , whatever it is you 're -- at some level , you have to start adding back some of that incremental labor that has been cut . Take managers kind of off the front desk and get them back and bring in some of the more traditional staffing that you have . <p> So , I do think we 'll see good flow-throughs . I think that , again , what we 're seeing now in this environment is somewhere between kind of 35% and 40% type retention levels at these low occupancy levels that we sit at today . <p> Yes , that 's helpful . I appreciate the thoughts . And then I was curious , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comp sets , what percent of those hotels are closed or have suspended operations ? <p> Yes . We 've got some sense . I would say the sense that we have is frankly , probably more anecdotal than what 's getting reported by Smith Travel . I think as most know that Smith Travel has come out and said that until a hotel was closed for 30 days , it 's going to continue to be included as reporting in the comp set . So we 're just getting now to the point where some of the hotels that closed later in the month of March or into April are coming out of those sets . <p> I think as reported by Smith Travel , it 's in kind of the high single-digit percentage numbers . I think realistically , it 's likely higher than that . About 8% or 9% of our total rooms are closed . My sense is that the comp set is at least that high and probably a little bit higher than that . We should be able to have a more concise answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to get better data from Smith Travel on closures . <p> Okay . That 's helpful . And then lastly , I think somebody earlier had kind of spoken to breakeven occupancy . I 'm not sure that you guys gave a figure or not . I might have missed it , but could you give us a sense of where you think breakeven occupancy is ? Is it both the GOP , hotel EBITDA and then maybe on a cash flow basis for your portfolio ? <p> Sure . Austin , it 's Dan . There 's a lot of variables that go into that . Clearly , at this level , there 's not as much labor . And as you continue to reopen and occupancy picks up , there is an added labor cost . So -- and a lot of it is a function of the rate you use . So , if we think that at a breakeven level for hotel level EBITDA , it 's somewhere between probably 40% and 45% using $100 as the base rate . Obviously , it depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover costs at a corporate level of probably 10 basis -- 10 percentage points higher . That does include covering the preferred dividends and Capex in that as well . <p> That 's a great question , Bill . I would , at this point , say RevPAR is probably the easiest way back . But it 's really a function of how the operating model changes and evolves , a combination of what the supply picture looks like and our ability to push rate , which both , I believe , will be favorable in the future . But I think my perspective would be RevPAR would recover first . <p> I would say it 's frankly pretty small . We do have the hotel on Yale campus , and we bought the hotel out in Portland that gets some exposure from some of that , from the university right there and with the Marriott in Boulder . But I would n't say it 's a particularly large demand generator across the portfolio generally . <p> Bill , it 's Dan . I think , our perspective on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think that is where the pickup is likely to be , and that 's where we 're seeing a lot of the successes that we 're having currently across the board . So , we think that will be consistent with what we 've seen the last couple of weeks . <p> Yes . I mean I think it 's fair to say that everybody is in some level of distress right now , particularly the smaller owner-operators . I do n't know that there is an immediate opportunity regardless of the level of leverage or operations . I think that banks have generally been supportive of smaller owner operators and giving them time to get their feet back under them . <p> As far as opportunities , our priority right now is really on the portfolio . And based on our portfolio , the locations , the chain scale and the operating model , we think there 's a lot of value to be created from here , simply with that . But to the extent there is an opportunity in the future , we do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this space . And we 've got a terrific partner with GIC , and we could look at things along those lines . <p> Great . And then more from like a distribution strategy . So , once you start ramping back up , what does your distribution mix look like ? Do you lean into maybe some channels more than you typically would or do you kind of -- yes , that 's -- is -- yes , it 's just going to be a mix ? Or is it going to be the same as what it would have been pre-outbreak , I guess ? <p> Well , I think one of the strengths of our portfolio and our operating model is we do have flexibility where we were probably more of a balanced business versus leisure from an occupancy standpoint . I think there will be more of a bias towards leisure . I think there 'll be an increased focus on digital as we try to be creative and proactive in driving that business . So yes , I think there will definitely be a shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go after business and fill rooms . <p> Well , again , thank you all for your partnership and patience with the power outage . We look forward to connecting soon . Hopefully , that will be in person . I hope you all have a terrific day . Thank you .

@@31851941 <h> Words Matter <h> By <p> As spring and summer testing dates for the SAT and ACT have been canceled due to COVID-19 , many colleges across the nation have announced that they will make the tests optional for those entering college in 2021 . <p> Although these are mostly temporary policy shifts , the announcements come on the heels of a long-standing national debate about whether colleges should go test optional anyway . Opponents of standardized testing often paint test-optional policies as a great leveler that will make college admissions more equal , though the data are largely inconclusive . <p> Over the past few years , several colleges have adopted a test-optional model . Although increasing diversity is usually one of the first goals they cite , it 's also true that such policies benefit colleges by increasing the applicant pool and lowering their admit percentage , a key metric of prestige in college ranking systems . <p> Yet COVID-19 has forced many colleges to go this route with little to no planning . Given this scenario , it 's worth revisiting what we really mean when we say the test is optional . This phrasing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it conflates " optional " with " unhelpful " or " not important . " After all , the Free Application for Federal Student Aid is not required for college admission , but is it truly optional for students who ca n't afford to pay full sticker price ? <p> Like any institution , colleges operate according to their own sets of ( often unspoken ) norms . Because much of college admissions is a black box , even wealthy and well-connected families worry that their children have n't accumulated enough achievements . For students and families who are n't steeped in these norms , deciphering the rules of the game can be even tougher . <p> Students who would be the first in their family to graduate from college may be more likely than their wealthier peers to take the statement that a test is optional at face value . Why prepare and pay for a test that is n't absolutely necessary , especially if you 're already dealing with limited resources ? <p> Yet students and parents who are familiar with how educational institutions operate are well aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet important , activities in high school . These activities range from taking AP classes to joining clubs and forming close relationships with teachers . Wealthier students do n't need to bypass the many opportunities available to distinguish themselves . So why do we insist that students from low-income backgrounds should ? Why do n't we insist that they have access to all of the same opportunities ? <p> As I 've argued elsewhere , submitting SAT and ACT scores routinely increases students ' chances of being admitted to college , receiving more financial aid and placing out of remedial and introductory courses -- even at test-optional universities . The use of the term " optional " is irresponsible because it obscures the very real benefits students can gain from preparing for the test and submitting their scores . <p> While some argue that we should simply use high school grades rather than standardized tests to make admissions decisions , there are many problems with this approach , including the difficulty of fairly comparing grades across schools , districts and states and the fact that schools serving wealthier students routinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point average , a high test score can provide admissions officers with additional information about their potential to succeed in college . <p> An exhaustive study by University of California faculty earlier this year found that making the SAT and ACT optional could actually decrease diversity on campus . In 2018 , about 5,700 first-generation students became eligible through the admissions index -- which combines SAT and GPA -- who would not have done so on the basis of their GPA alone . So did about 5,000 students from low-income backgrounds . For these students , a strong SAT score made all the difference . <p> Although the UC system has also declared the tests optional this year , out of fairness to students who do n't have a score , its faculty Academic Senate believes so strongly in the tests ' value for students that it voted unanimously to keep SAT and ACT requirements for at least the next five years . Academic Senate Chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani said , " The way that the UC uses these tests protects disadvantaged students and allows for a more diverse student population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reshape college admissions . What I do know is that we need to be honest with students about the persistent inequities in the college admissions process rather than suggesting they can be fixed by a few simple tweaks . <p> That means we should n't keep calling the test " optional " when we know a good score will increase students ' chances of getting into college , paying for college and graduating on time . <h> Bio <p> Yoon S.

@@31857441 <p> The new-look National Party this week has to start telling New Zealanders exactly how it would lead the country 's economic recovery . <p> It urgently needs to come out with something - one economic policy - to avoid discrediting its entire campaign , centred on rebuilding " the economy you live in ... not the economy the bureaucracy talks about " . <p> Press gallery journalists are feasting on the fresh meat that is Todd Muller . His straight-shooting approach is what makes him the guy you want at your BBQ , but it 's also what makes him susceptible to being baited by journalists fishing for news . <p> Five days , two unwanted controversies <p> Since becoming leader , he has made more headlines for having a " Make America Great Again " hat displayed in his office , alongside a Hilary Clinton badge , than he has for anything economically-related . <p> Just as the white supremacy hat saga subsided , Muller found himself in hot water for the lack of ethnic diversity on his front bench . <p> Grilled by journalists on Tuesday morning for only having two Maori MPs in his shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new deputy Nikki Kaye made matters worse by adding Paul Goldsmith to the list , saying he has Ngati Porou connections . Muller ran with this . <p> While the duo was talking to one cluster of journalists , Goldsmith told another , " I have Maori connections , but I 'm not Maori myself " . <p> Minutes later , journalists asked Bennett how she felt about the new leadership holding up Goldsmith as a Maori representative . She laughed and snapped , " Paul ? ! Ok , right . They 're running the show now , so they can answer to it . " <p> This is golden TV montage material . <p> Bennett 's decision to not only make no attempt to salvage her colleagues , but emphasise their blunder , means the other narrative behind the story is that divisions in the party are raw and ugly . <p> Some will look at these situations and think , ' The desperate media is creating a storm in a teacup ' . Others will see them as speaking to Muller 's principles and character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National wants it . <p> Personality politics not an option <p> The new-look party knows it needs to avoid turning the election campaign into a ' Todd vs . Jacinda show ' . It 's aware it 'll lose a battle fought on personality politics . <p> Muller has repeatedly referred to National as being a " team of 55 " , pitting it against Labour , which has " three heavy lifters and 17 empty chairs " . <p> He will draw on the experienced strong performers in his party - Kaye , Amy Adams and Judith Collins - as well as his ambitious supporters , now holding key portfolios - Nicola Willis and Chris Bishop . <p> Labour on the other hand , will continue keeping the spotlight on Ardern and Grant Robertson . <p> In emphasising the strength of National 's " team " , supposedly unified by a leader with a track record of finding common ground among people , National 's focus will have to be on policy . <p> Indeed , Muller in his first speech as leader , had a go at Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition for opposition 's sake . We 're all tired of that kind of politics . I 'm about ideas that get results . " <p> He said his " absolute focus " was New Zealand 's economic recovery , pledging to be the right person to lead this with a corporate background at Fonterra , Zespri and Apata . <p> " I 've run businesses . I can read a balance sheet and a profit and loss account . I can tell a good one from a bad one , " he said . <p> Like Robertson , he said he did n't want to see " austerity " and would n't commit to tax changes . He could n't say how much debt was appropriate , but emphasised the need for quality spend - all stuff we 've heard before . <p> Pushed by interest.co.nz on Tuesday on his performance , and asked when he would release the first iteration of his economic recovery plan , Muller said : " This is day five ... I wo n't be standing here in four weeks with you still asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an absolute priority for us . And yes , we will phase our responses as you would expect us to . " <p> During his first question time in parliament as leader , Muller quizzed Ardern on why she had n't given businesses affected by COVID-19 cash payments , arguing the wage subsidy was essentially a payment to workers . <p> Muller has not however come out with a policy saying which businesses National would give cash to , how this would work , how much it would cost , etc . <p> It three weeks ago released a policy suggesting the Government gives small businesses cash refunds of up to $100,000 based on the GST paid in the six months to January 2020 . It proposed that if a business paid more than $100,000 over that period , they could claim up to an additional $250,000 as a repayable loan over five years . <p> Little room to manoeuvre in the battle for the centre <p> One can appreciate Muller is only just getting his feet under the table and needs to consult his caucus before coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the extent of the COVID-19 fallout that it 's impossible to plan too far ahead . A policy that might seem logical today , could be inappropriate in six months ' time . <p> And with Robertson being relatively conservative and constrained by NZ First , there is n't a whole lot of scope for National to differentiate itself when it comes to policy . What 's more , both National and Labour are yet again fighting for centrist votes , preventing them from campaigning on anything too radical . <p> But if you 're Muller , and you want to take the prime ministership off one of the most popular leaders in the world , who 's led an effort to nearly stamp out COVID-19 , you need some serious ammunition . <p> Hoping that come September 19 , the reality of job losses will be biting and people will be looking to the party that got the country through the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and 2011/12 Canterbury earthquakes for change , wo n't be enough . <p> National needs an exceptional economic recovery plan . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan this week . But in the absence of phase one , all National has in the eyes of the public is a seemingly smart and decent leader of a divided party , who 's getting smashed for his lack of political nous . <p> Muller needs to give himself something substantive to talk about , as he introduces himself to the country and tries to build a brand .

And quite frankly bring the parents is one of the factors we used to attract skilled migrants .

Instead encourage NZer to veer away from property investment and more into productive investment once the virus mess/global depression wears off . - Allow skilled migrants to come , but with a focus on those who have lived here before . - No special tourist visas for any particular nationality .

Steal a march ! Given recent outpourings we all understand the government needs to increase its revenue markedly . The tax take most certainly will play the major role . The people of NZ are entitled to know what lies in store over the next three years at least , and how it will affect them . National claim to be the party of economic prowess , they continually promote they are better equipped than Labour to lead the recovery . Therefore , put a clear , coherent and viable plan of their proposed tax regime on the table as early as possible for the electorate to digest , approve and vote on . <p> ' The tax take most certainly will play the major role ' ... will it though ? The soft ' national ' voting cohort is essential to secure the treasury benches as Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centrist voters for whom tax is a critical issue . And just as she is buying election day support from middle NZ by paying double benefits to the newly middle NZ jobless she will proceed very carefully on tax solutions to fund NZs burgeoning debt . Kicking it down the road while interest rates are so low will keep middle onside . <p> Yes there is a threat in there , latent but still a real threat . There was a great deal of tax restructuring left on the shelf by the untimely and ungrateful 2009 defeat of the Clark/Cullen lot . Is that now to be dusted off under the smokescreen of the impact of CV19 ? The electorate got wind of it prior to the last election causing an eleventh hour U turn by the Labour hierarchy . Given the present economic adversity facing all of NZ , both National and Labour have a duty to reveal to the people of NZ precisely , what their tax policy will be if they gain power at the next election . <p> Determining with any degree of reliability what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even govt officials are struggling , with the latest treasury projections already looking too optimistic . Robertson is still at ' best guessing ' stage and to suggest Muller &amp; co with their limited resources should produce a detailed tax plan in this fast moving environment is unrealistic . He is already trying to position this as a contest of cabinet depth and experience as opposed to a fiscally dry debating contest . <p> Yes therein lies the problem . Latest treasury predictions looking too optimistic . At the time of that announcement it was not difficult to digest them with quite some skepticism . In times of uncertainty it is beholden on governments to provide certainty to their people . Elderly are now finding earnings from savings becoming meaningless . Previously well employed are now unemployed . Well managed household budgets have been blown asunder .

As the caption correctly and succinctly explains , substance is needed , and fast ! <p> ' high flying earners in the fiscal areas of our civil service ' ..... over the last 20 years NZs labour productivity growth averaged 1.4% pa to an OECD average of 2% . Our health sector lagged significantly at 0.8% and the education sector at negative 1.4% . About as high flying as AIRNZ . <p> high flying earners refers to those individuals in the upper echelons of what used to be called public servants but who are now executives of all shapes and descriptions . Or as a Southland farmer years ago liked to describe them as shiny arses . There are salaries and packages that would make your eyes water .

The current PGF funding model is n't what is needed as they look for councils and others to ' match ' funding . No time for that - we just need new industries to be established with haste . <p> We 're all going to be affected by unemployment - jobs , jobs , jobs needed and the government is best placed to take on the capital risk at this moment in history . <p> I do n't think SOEs are necessarily the way forward but I do believe that barriers which encourage production in the country are a sensible measure . We have to start producing " stuff " and creating jobs not dependent on construction . <p> They are certainly one model . During the GFC we saw a lot of stakes taken in financial institutions in the UK and elsewhere . In the Asia FC we saw Hong Kong buying a huge chunk of listed equity ( albeit as a by product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The issue I suppose with SoE is that noone has any skin in the game . Whilst it 's not an ideal solution I 'd prefer to see private entrepreneurs building businesses with govt help . <p> My point was this governments dire record in direct enterprise management and oversight . I agree with you and Kate that in this rare set of circumstances governments must assume capital risk as if they do n't the necessary big projects wo n't happen . But for the short term only . SOEs have proven poor long run capital managers with the increased return on just 51% of the power generators equity vs previous full ownership an example . They also have a lousy record at picking winners . Even unfettered Shane Jones struggles to identify projects worthy enough to burnish his political ambitions . How proponents of more direct state involvement believe a low productivity bureaucracy will somehow magically transform overnight to Roosevelt new dealers and outshane Shane , is fascinating . A NZ resurrection of the polish shipyard syndrome is inevitable if the Twyfords of this world believe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government equity ownership is unavoidable but creating new government managed enterprise just to soak up labour will deliver a 2020 version of the fun 1930s sugar bag days . Robertson is trying to give business low interest loans without much success because banks as gatekeepers have already set their debt covenants with their customers and additional state subsidised money would ratchet up the risk profile of existing loans . Other methods must be found to get the banks on board as they are the only institutions equipped to pick the winners and manage the risk . <p> One of the key reasons Kiwibuild has n't worked is because the houses were built by private sector developers who NEED a profit margin ( typically 20-30% ) . If the government is the ' developer ' , but they use private sector builders , then the govt obviously does n't need to make a profit . Those 630K 3 bedroom townhouses , then become 480-500K ... And wham ! The programme works , because the dwellings are actually much closer to some semblance of ' affordability ' ... Not rocket science ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers disappear . Most of the jobs are in the design and construction anyway . Most of them are struggling at those lower price points anyway . No policy is without it 's costs . <p> I 'd prefer to see private entrepreneurs building businesses with govt help . <p> That makes no sense as then the profits of the taxpayers help are fully privatised . And all the people who work for the SOE have skin in the game - that being their ongoing employment . Same as hospitals and schools - teachers , nurses and all other employees are very invested in getting good outcomes for the public . <p> Sure you could structure along the lines of Crown Fibre Holdings - but not so sure the public actually got much of the benefit - no cost of capital during the build out and an $11m discount on sale to one of the consortium partners ; <p> In this case there were specific technical jobs with specific expertise existing in the market - so the model you suggest made sense . It could be a very good model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selectively mill the kauri , for example . <p> But in creating new manufacturing jobs in the economy on a large scale - much of the training ( as machinists , etc ) will need to be from the ground up . Therefore , full Crown ownership makes sense . <p> What government startups are you referring to - then I can explain to you why they might have failed . <p> Most of the SOEs I can think of are still going strong or sold off to raise cash for the government . Solid Energy being an exception ( extreme head office largesse ) but from what I saw , the nail in the coffin for them was John Key deciding they had to purchase the assets of Pike River . <p> Agree with you Kate about using our resources but think we should use smart technology .

Besides her Dad and I , everybody told her she never find a job in her field . Went to Perth and after hard 6 month found permanent job in her field at a local company . Loves it , good pay , company car , phone , laptop . Essential worker and well looked after . I think NZ lacks innovation and thinking outside the square and we are not very good at looking after our young and give them room to fly . Too much focus on short term profit vs potential in my opinion . <p> And you are so right - with a degree like hers she should have had more than ample opportunities in New Zealand - but our problem is our private sector entrepreneurs are n't textile goods manufacturing oriented - more software , entertainment , graphics , architecture , etc. oriented . <p> The government needs to get involved in building our manufacturing sector/capability for a whole lot of reasons ... not the least of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm guessing he will want to open the borders as quickly as possible to man dads business ... <p> Apata , Muller left his role at Zespri to take up the position of CEO at Apata Ltd in January 2006. 6 Apata , a Bay of Plenty company specialising in post-harvest operations , was founded by his father and others in 1983https : **26;454;TOOLONG MALAYSIA RSE Applications for the 2020 season are now open .

The election is all but a foregone conclusion with labour between 50 to 60% of the votes .

I guess our productivity is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the secret that allows businesses to be profitable without employees to do the work . <p> Weird statement was n't it ? Payinmg a business to pay the employees means spare money to use elsewhere in the business ( or not paying staff ) , the outcome is money kept in the business but with the bonus of keeping workers for a period at least . I thought the idea was smart instead of just giving cash for any use <p> Would n't an obvious touchstone be pointing out the gaping loopholes in the Foreign Buyer Ban ?

Calculating the cost of division with Heather McGhee : podcast and transcript <p> Chris Hayes speaks with author and political commentator Heather McGhee about how this public health crisis is shining a light on the ramifications of policies and politics rooted in the legacy of racism . <p> Why are African Americans getting hit the hardest by the coronavirus ? In part , this public health crisis is shining a light on the ramifications of policies and politics rooted in the legacy of racism . And what 's interesting , and what Heather McGhee is writing about for her upcoming book , is the way these racially motivated politics end up creating bad economic policy overall , producing a government that makes everyone worse off . <p> So while we watch scenes of people lining up for miles to get groceries from food banks and hear about unemployed Americans struggling within a broken system to receive some kind of financial relief , Heather McGhee joins to discuss the true cost of a racially divided nation . <p> Note : This is a rough transcript -- please excuse any typos . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Societies that have a public health system that is highly functioning , well coordinated and well resourced are obviously going to do better in a public health crisis . And we have resisted that in the richest country on the planet , in large part for the past 100 years because of racism . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Hello and welcome to " Why Is This Happening ? " with me , your host , Chris Hayes . Well , here I am , back in the closet for yet another week of quarantine podcasting out there in the world and I 've been thinking about , there 's sort of an interesting thing I think that 's happened in terms of the socioeconomic and racial lines of division in the country with respect to coronavirus . Two things at once . So at one level , as the data has come in , we are seeing that there are massively disproportionate effects , particularly for African Americans , but for black and brown Americans versus white Americans . <p> We 've seen this in the fatality numbers , particularly in places like New York , Louisiana , and Detroit , and there 's a bunch of reasons that contribute to that . Some of which I think were probably discussed in today 's conversation . There 's two stacked on top of each other . The fact that African Americans in the U.S. because of the long legacy of white supremacy and racism are more susceptible to a bunch of preexisting conditions that essentially compound the danger of coronavirus and also the medical care they get now , even in the hospital . There 's study after study that shows the ways in which racism and racial lenses negatively affect their treatment . So that 's one fact , right ? It 's not the great equalizer , the coronavirus . <h> Related <p> But then the other fact is that the virus does n't give a s--- what color you are and will come for you . And if you 're sitting somewhere in America being like , well that 's just happening in New Orleans , that 's just happening to black folks in Detroit . That 's just getting the people in the Bronx like no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . It 's not the way it works . If you think that , if you get lulled into thinking that , you are going to have an outbreak where you live . And the tension between those two is to me almost one of the most fundamental tensions at the heart of American politics , sociology and political economy , which is we are all in this together and yet , we are all in this together A , B , we 're not all equal , and C , the belief that some have that they can wall themselves off from those other people over there in America makes everyone worse . <p> So if you think , " You know what , we 're going to get back to work in my county because we 're not like those gross big cities that have all that density and transportation . We 're going to go back , I 'm going to go to my nail salon , I 'm going to go to my massage studio . " You are inviting an outbreak where you live based on your dumb--- , probably racist beliefs about the evil infections of your dumb--- , probably racist beliefs , about the susceptibility to infection of the big cities . And that is just a constant theme throughout , I mean it is bright as day right now , but it 's a constant theme throughout the whole history of the country . <p> And my good friend , someone who I truly admire and look up to and respect , Heather McGhee just released this Ted Talk she gave , which is basically about this thesis and it is a teaser for the book that she has written , is writing , that 's going to be coming out in 2021 called " The Sum of Us . " And it is about precisely this dynamic . It 's about the ways in which the legacy of racism and white supremacy produces a politics that produces a government that makes everyone worse off . That basically cutting off the nose to spite the face time and time and time again and never has it been more obvious than this moment right now . And so I thought it would be awesome . Also , I have n't talked to her for awhile , so I thought it 'd be an awesome quarantine conversation to talk to my buddy scholar Heather McGhee . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Hey Chris . <p> CHRIS HAYES : How are you ? <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : I mean , I personally am fine , right ? I 'm healthy as far as I know , my family is okay . Financially it 's tough , but I 'm okay . But as a citizen of this country and of this world , I 'm heartbroken . This is worse than we feared , right ? When this man walked into the White House , it was like , please do n't let anything really terrible happen on his watch . And it has and he has bungled it more than we possibly could have articulated from waiting too long , to telling people to ingest bleach today . It 's just really bad , and people are dying because of it . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Yeah . The word , I 'm glad you used the word heartbroken , because I was talking to a friend last night in a Zoom cocktail hour and I 'm going to get choked up actually right now , so I 'll just try to keep it under control . But there 's the thing with the numbers and this is such a cliche and trite observation , obviously Joseph Stalin said this years ago , but you 're looking at the numbers and it 's 50,000 dead and what does that mean ? Then , we have people in our company who we lost . We have people on staff who have lost loved ones . I have friends who have lost loved ones . The grief is everywhere . I find it very overwhelming and very upsetting and heartbreaking . I feel deep grief and mourning and sadness a lot that I 'm just wrestling with all the time . <p> CHRIS HAYES : But also that idea of what you just said is so true . The nightmare is here and it is a nightmare and I mean , I can believe and ca n't believe that we 're living through this nightmare . But the thing that , I was thinking about , remember when he did that dumb--- thing with the hurricane where he Sharpied it , he was wrong about the path and he said it was going to hit Georgia I think , and Alabama and it was n't , and then he Sharpied in the path . And I remember doing a bit on my show where it 's like this is funny and dumb but also serious and also like thank God it did n't actually get anyone killed . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah . <p> CHRIS HAYES : But the stakes are really high and now it 's like here we are . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah . Here we are and we have someone who after fumbling and lying and completely mishandling the situation is now firmly settled into his sweet spot of divisive politics of trying to create an us versus them within our own country and doing it really successfully , right ? I mean down to the federal government picking winners and losers with protective equipment and outbidding states and stockpiling and suggesting that they should , Florida where Donald Trump has escaped to , because New York wo n't have him anymore , has more protective equipment and ventilators than it even wanted . And you 're starting to see just this past week with a reported ban on immigration , Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education moving to make sure that dreamers do n't get any kind of aid . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : You 're starting to see a clear , racialized divide and conquer . And Mitch McConnell saying that basically blue states can go bankrupt and red states that are more rural just can open up their economies and win . This is the formula , right ? It 's shrink the circle of human concern , give the people on your team an outsized sense of security and superiority . And in fact , make them delight a little bit in that . That is heartbreaking to me as someone who cares about humanity , cares about this country , cares about our soul , right ? We are absolutely failing . And just last week , I think they 've already gotten too much attention , but of course it was shocking . There were a handful of protests where you had mostly older white folks defying the protective orders to go out and protest and they were funded by the same right wing billionaires that have funded so much of the Tea Party . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And those people are going to get sick , right ? It was supposed to be a drive by protest and they got out of their cars and they smush their faces against the Capitol building and it 's like they were literally exposing themselves to die for this bargain . And that 's what my book is about , that 's what the Ted Talk was about , is the ways that racism costs everyone in the end . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Yeah , let 's start with that phone call that I think is , in some ways was the first moment I think , or the seeds of the book . Even though you 're work had focused on this long before that phone call on C-SPAN . <p> I just posted a YouTube that someone had cut of me on a very early C-SPAN appearance in which a caller while I 'm looking into the camera says , " I just had an idea that one of the ways we can deal with garbage is put them down volcanoes and what do you think of that ? " And I was like , I had to look in the camera , that is outside my area of expertise . But I thought of that because as I was watching the President just be like , I 'm just spit balling here , but maybe we get some UV light up inside the body . I do n't know how you do that , but it took me back to that moment . But all of this by way of saying the genre of C-SPAN calls is a fascinating and multifaceted one . And you had this , you were on a C-SPAN Washington Journal and someone called in , tell me what happened . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah . So I was on that live television show , which is really like radio talk shows , but on TV , and the whole visual screen is your face reacting to this person . And someone called in identified as Gary from North Carolina . And his first words were , " I 'm a white male and I 'm prejudiced . " It 's kind of like the garbage in the volcano . What do you say ? What do you do ? You know , I was on there talking about tax policy and jobs and the deficit , right ? He went on to say that he was basically afraid of black men and drugs and gangs and crime . But then he said , but I want to change and I want to know what your guest would tell me to do to become a better American . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And that got to me . And so I responded not by trying to deconstruct his bias in that way that you might , if you were really pissed at someone saying that they were so prejudiced against your people on live television . But I thanked him for being honest , and I gave him some simple tips about how he could integrate his life and unlearn the messages that he 's learned . And that clip of our exchange went viral and you know , the official count is 8 million , but we had at one point counted it up as 20 , it just keeps having a life of its own because people were surprised that a black woman would n't get angry . And they were surprise that a white man would admit his bias on national television . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : In the end , after that exchange , Gary from North Carolina and I ended up getting to know each other . And what I learned from him was many things actually . But what I learned from him was that his racism was causing him to suffer . He had acute social anxiety , a sort of moral panic , and he was the one primarily suffering from his racism and it was n't , for me it was a light bulb moment that there was a through line from the economic work that I 've done my whole career as an economic policy person working at Demos , which is a progressive think tank that I ran for four years and worked at for 16 , there was an economic argument I was making and policies I was pursuing that really taught me that you ca n't contain the fallout of racially motivated , bad economic policy decision making . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : The seminal experience of my career has been , was trying to stop the subprime mortgage crisis in the early 2000s , before it ended up creating a toxic mix of racism and greed that took down the global economy . And seeing how , if we had stopped it then , back when it was only bad mortgages going to homeowners with good credit in black and brown neighborhoods , if anybody had cared who had the power to stop it , we literally would not have had the financial crisis if it were n't for racism . So I was able to connect that through line . It caused me to go on this journey over the past two years traveling the country and making the case that racism has a cost for everyone . <p> CHRIS HAYES : That example of the financial crisis is such an astute one . And also there 's an amazing example you give that I think is like the best , which is the picture of the pool , which is so perfect about the cost to everyone . Tell the story of the pool , because it to me is like a self contained story about what the thesis is here . It works perfectly . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : So I went to Montgomery , Alabama , where there is a park in the middle of the city called Oak Park , which back in the 1930s and forties was part of a nationwide building boom of beautiful public parks . You and I , as people who are born in the 70s and 80s , we do n't really know this phenomenon , but it started in the New Deal , and then in the postwar era , these beautiful , grand swimming pools that were the heart of these communities , cities and towns all across the country . And they could hold a thousand people and they were this urban planner 's vision of classlessness , right ? The middle and upper class would all meet in their bathing suits and fall in love and get married , right ? <p> CHRIS HAYES : The one that I know the best , which I ca n't believe existed , there 's this Barton Springs in Austin , Texas , which is a natural swimming pool . It 's a natural springs and it 's built around it . And when you go there you think , " Am I in a country club ? " You 're pinching yourself that this thing exists as a public good . That no , you just go , it 's public . You go and you swim in these cool fresh springs , and everyone hangs out and it 's like , this is incredible . I ca n't believe this is a thing . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : This is now a very rare sight because for the most part , even in northern cities , those grand public pools , those resort pools were public . They were funded by taxpayer dollars and they were exclusively for whites only . And in the 1950s when civil rights groups began to advocate and litigate against this practice ... of exclusion , and the barrier started to fall down . Towns did what Montgomery , Alabama did , which was effective January 1st , 1959 . The town council voted to close the public swimming pool . Not only Chris , did they close the pool , right ? They drained the public pool . They filled it in with dirt , paved it over . They also shut down the entire parks department . They had a zoo , they had recreation centers , they had a dozen public parks . They closed it all down for a decade , and when they finally reopened it , they never rebuilt the pool . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : That , to me is what has happened to our whole country . We had a very generous social welfare system that included subsidized housing , no down payment mortgages that were backed by the federal government , the Homestead Act , the land grant college system . We had a sort of a middle class that was constructed by government policy that was the envy of the world when it was for whites only , and really for white men only . And when the movement of the 1960s opened the doors to everybody else , the doors were closed on that vision , and so we 've all been living in a stingier , drained public pool . We 've been all been living in that drained public pool where our schools are underfunded , our roads and bridges are crumbling . They get a D+ from the American Society of Civil Engineers . The world we know , right ? I mean , this is the world we know . <p> CHRIS HAYES : We 're watching , right now what we 're watching this enormous global test of state capacity that is a challenge for every government . You know , even the best government , it 's an enormous challenge for , and the U.S. is just really failing the state capacity test . I mean , in fits and starts and certain localized places being able to kind of get its act together . But on the whole , as a global test of state capacity , just how good and competent , and how administratively efficient is your state ? We are not doing that well , and that 's for everyone . Again , like it 's not that it does n't have disproportionate effects , but the general level of administrative capacity of the American state is not particularly high right now . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : That is absolutely right , and this administration also accelerated a trend , and did things specifically to put to minimize the state 's capacity to respond . Whether it was cutting the public health positions that would have been able to stop this earlier on , dismantling the chief in charge of pandemic response in the spring of 2018 , whether it was making sure that our healthcare infrastructure remained in this state for the past almost four years of seesawing between attempts to kill the Affordable Care Act , to undermine , to create work requirements on the Medicaid that we have . To fund the fights against Medicaid expansion in mostly the former Confederate states . And here 's where race comes in , again . Societies that have a public health system that is highly functioning , well coordinated and well-resourced are obviously going to do better in a public health crisis , and we have resisted that in the richest country on the planet in large part for the past 100 years because of racism . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : It was the Southern Democrats who stopped president Truman from being able to have a national health insurance plan . It was a resistance by a racially organized Republican party that stopped Obamacare from being anything like actually having a collective at its core , stopped the public option , stopped the ability to negotiate drug prices . Anything where we would have to sort of be in it together , our government has resisted . And today the states that do n't have Medicaid expansion , which means that working class people , white , black , brown , are unable to qualify for Medicaid , which means that working class people who make $10,000 a year , $12,000 , $15,000 a year , make too much money to qualify for Medicaid even though their employers have no interest in offering them healthcare . People in those dozen or so states are left without . They 're uninsured , they 're dying at higher rates and their hospitals , many of them in their rural communities are closing because they have no healthcare infrastructure . And social science research has shown that racial resentment drives white opposition to Medicaid expansion . It 's seen as a black program , and it is resisted by the majority of white people . <p> CHRIS HAYES : The most perfect example of this right now in this moment is , we did the story on the show last night , which was the unemployment system in Florida . And Rick Scott back in 2011 revamped it and made it harder , a lot like these Medicaid work requirements . And the whole politics of that is , these other people over there , they 're lazy and shiftless , they do n't want to work . So we got to prod them to work , and you know what I 'm talking about when I 'm talking about those lazy people over there . You shiftless people , we ca n't let them be on the dole . We do n't want the safety net to turn into a hammock . So Scott makes , they cut benefits down from 26 weeks , I think to 12 and it makes it the one of the most onerous systems in the entire country . <p> CHRIS HAYES : You 've got to go through all these hoops . You used to be able to sign up on the phone . Now you get on the computer , you 've got to provide this documentation . Well , lo and be-f-------hold , and I 'm sure that was smart politics at a certain moment because it 's like , " Well I 'm not unemployed . And that 's those people over there . " And then like what do you know ? Millions of Floridians are unemployed and no one can get their stuff claim . And it 's like , it 's the drained pool , in real time in the last week . Now , I 'm getting emails from viewers being like , " I ca n't get my unemployment processed because someone somewhere thought it was good politics , " and maybe in the moment was good politics to go beat up on the unemployed , with all of the racial subtext of what that is . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah . That is where we are . What I 'm hopeful is that 's not where we 're going to be in six months , in a year , in two years . Because it feels to me like this is a cracking open of our society on such a fundamental level , where one of the major myths of American society , which is the myth of a hierarchy of human value , that there are just some groups of people that are inherently better than others and that the fortunes of society sort of accrue to those better groups . And so , the misfortune of people who are down on their luck , as we say it 's in some way those people deserved it , right ? The undeserving and the deserving is sort of the fulcrum of American society , and it 's always been racialized , but right now as much as Trump is trying to , and the billionaire right-wing donor class is trying to sow the seeds of division , eight , nine out of 10 people agree with the stay at home orders . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Right . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : We 're ready . People understand that something terrifying is happening . We 've watched enough apocalyptic television to be like , " Okay , this is it . This is time . " There is a sense , right ? The support for Medicare for all is at the highest level it 's ever been . It 's at majority support . You 've got support for things that were already popular , like a wealth tax and a guaranteed income , shooting up even more . You 've got Republicans saying we need a universal basic income . You 've got countries that are doing things like that , having unemployment rates that increased by a percentage and a half , as opposed to going up to 12 percent which the CBO , the Congressional Budget Office just predicted today . This is hurting too many people to continue to let our us versus them politics create an illusion of safety . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And I hope that coming on , the incredible momentum that Progressives have had at the ballot box , and an organizing led by women in the 2018 midterms , even in Wisconsin , which we thought was going to be a tragedy , not just electorally , but on a human level and still may be the latter . But you saw people brave a really evil , frankly , bargain to try to suppress the vote . You saw people say , " No , I do n't want this right-wing Trump Supreme Court justice . I want somebody who believes in the public interest . " So I 'm cautiously optimistic . I 've been wrong before by doing that , but I 'm cautiously optimistic . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Here , I want to talk a little bit about how you deal with this because I think that there 's a literature that 's built up , both analysts like yourself and also there 's been political scientists and historians . All together , there 's sort of a growing literature about this , as a descriptive matter of how American politics has worked , the fulcrum of race and the social welfare state , right ? That we know that racial resentment in Michael Tesler and other people 's work has this correlation to people that views on things that are n't explicitly about race , but essentially racial resentment becomes a sort of proxy variable to determine your views on redistribution more broadly . And that the politics of that has created the kind of much less , much weaker public sector the US has , compared to other OECD countries . Right ? <p> CHRIS HAYES : So then the question becomes , okay , what 's the way around that ? And one of the approaches , and I think this has been kind of a Bernie Sanders approach more in 2016 than I think now . I think there was some growth in his analysis . Is this kind of , can you do a kind of class first politics , a class first populism that says , " Look , put all that stuff aside , focus on the drug companies that are f------ you , and focus on the big banks because everyone hates them , and they want to raise taxes on the rich and look at all these polling . Polling on all this stuff is good . You could build a coalition that 's sort of a class first coalition that sidesteps all at racial stuff might even just say like , enough with the wokeness , use whatever words you want . " That stuff 's ancillary to what we 're trying to do here . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : It 's a class struggle . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Yeah . I think it 's not an insane idea , but I think that it 's shown its shortcomings and I 'm curious to hear your thoughts on that approach . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah . That is the big question , right ? I think that that approach is naive . The way I like to picture it is white , maybe unemployed , maybe marginally employed , former worker in Wisconsin , goes to a Bernie Sanders rally , absolutely gets the full bore , colorblind economic populist argument , is psyched about it . Is like , " Yes , that makes sense . The corporations are the bad guys . It 's the politicians that are in the pockets of the corporations , and they 're the ones who have screwed us . " Does n't hear anything about race except maybe some disparities story , right , is told yes , and also brown and black people are suffering more than you , and then maybe , okay . Then gets back in his truck and turns on talk radio , and here 's the people with the loudest megaphones in society , whether it 's Fox News or conservative talk radio or the president of the United States doing an entirely racialized narrative that says it 's not the corporations that you would love to work for again , who are screwing you over . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : It 's actually these brown and black people and every public programming that you 've had , from what your parents may have joked about around the kitchen table when you were growing up , to the fact that you live in a segregated place where you never see people of color . And if you do , you know they 're on the nightly news as as criminals , all of that other programming in our highly racialized society is going to say , " Why do n't you want to be on the winning team ? These people are losers . Rich people are winners . " Why would n't you want to trade up , instead of having solidarity with people who are the perennial losers of American history ? <p> CHRIS HAYES : But I also think there 's an even more insidious version of that . So , the version of , " It 's not the corporations , it 's these people . " The thing that I think Bannon and Trump got at 2016 , which he does n't do as well without Bannon in there , but like Tucker Carlson does , is it 's actually worse than that . It 's actually the corporations are actually , they 're also the enemy , and they , and the liberals in the cities . And the academics and Hollywood , they 're all in it together . Like immigrants , basically the immigrants and the urban black people , and the intellectuals and the elites , and the corporate people that took your job . They 're all part of this weird conspiracy , this kind of woke neoliberal thing that 's there to basically tear apart America , both through trade and through culture . <p> CHRIS HAYES : That is , in some ways an even more powerful message because they 're not even saying , " Do n't be mad at the big elites with a lot of money . " They kind of are , it 's that this like the Soros conspiracy is this bizarre conspiracy of poor black folks and immigrant farm workers , and then the rich and culturally powerful . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah , that 's right . That is the 2.0 that is much , much , much harder to fight . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : The good news , is they ca n't actually do it in the payoff , right ? <p> CHRIS HAYES : No , they ca n't . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : What do they do when they get into power ? <p> CHRIS HAYES : That 's right . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : They pass the trillion dollar tax cut . <p> CHRIS HAYES : They ca n't not do it . That 's right . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : What do they do in the COVID relief bill ? They further , have all of the tax relief go 80 percent of it to millionaires , right ? <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : ... Have all of the tax relief go , 80 percent of it to millionaires , the Senate Republicans sneak that in , right ? They do a small business thing , it ends up going to big chain restaurants , right ? They ca n't not do- <p> CHRIS HAYES : They ca n't deliver on that message . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : ... what they 're supposed to do , right ? <p> CHRIS HAYES : Yep . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : But what we need is more organizing , right ? We , I think we need two things . I do think we need a race conscious , multi-racial populism that arms white people who have competing frames in their minds . We did this deep research about this at Demos with my colleagues , Ian Haney Lopez and Anat Shenker-Osorio called the " Race-Class Narrative Project " and we found that the sort of persuadable folks in the middle of were n't just like at five on the one to 10 scale between racist and not racist . It 's that they held tens and ones at the same time . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Explain what that means . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Basically , there are these competing frames that explain American politics when it comes to race and class . There 's this one frame that says the rich are rich because they 're better than us and government needs to be smaller and people of color are not doing as well because they 're not as deserving and they do n't work as hard . That 's A , right , let 's put that at one on the sort of racial resentment scale . And then on 10 , it 's the good progressive , the corporations are the ones who are rigging the rules , government needs to be in the public interest again and people of color , we need to do everything we can so that people of color have an equal shot . And the reason why there are these disparities is because government and corporations break the rules . And both of those ideas exist in the minds of the quote unquote , persuadable folks . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : The people who are not sort of ideologically , absolutely in one camp or the other . Because they 've heard both . <p> CHRIS HAYES : This is such an important point about people in the center are moderates . It 's like the persuadables are just like , sometimes have just a weird mix of extreme views . That is a very common profile for a quote unquote persuadable voter . They 're not like temperamentally moderate and in the center on a bunch of stuff , they 're just like , oh no , like 9/11 was an inside job . We should n't be in the Iraq war and also like- Wall Street is run by Soros.I 'm saying this from first person experience knocking on doors in Dane County , Wisconsin , just by the way . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : No , absolutely . Human beings oftentimes hold very competing frames in our minds . And what matters is what 's primed . And this is why the progressive narrative deficit that we have , by that I mean we just do n't have the megaphone that the right does . Whether it 's the most watched cable network , sorry Chris , being Fox News or it 's the fact that right wing radio is a behemoth that has no corollary , or it 's the fact that Donald Trump , who has the biggest social media and media attention getting ability than anyone in the world are all giving you that other frame . And so it 's just a question of priming , which we used to call organizing , right ? It 's a question of who 's in your ear , who 's holding your hand , who 's explaining the world to you day in and day out . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And so there have been moments throughout our history and in recent times of beautiful cross-racial working class solidarity . The Fight for 15 which joined adjuncts and fast food workers and janitors and home healthcare aides in an explicitly pro-humanity , pro-dignity fight for a living wage . I spent a lot of time with Fight for 15 workers and they talked about it . They said , you know what , racism has a cost for us too . Like literally a white woman that I talked to who worked at Wendy 's was like , " Racism is what the boss uses to divide us . And we would n't have had such a low minimum wage if it were n't for racism and that 's why I have a stake in ending racism . " That exists , it is possible . <p> CHRIS HAYES : But to go back ... when you talk about these frames though , just to concretize a bit because I know the whole race , class work that you guys did was really fascinating and very influential . People probably do n't realize how influential it 's been among like Democratic politicians and their staffs and campaigns . That work was seminal and it 's seeded a lot of the ways that , if you were following the campaigns , presidential primary campaign , a lot of the stuff that you were hearing were straight up articulations of some of the stuff that you and your colleagues came up with . So what does it mean ? So you got these persuadable voters and they have these different frames . <p> CHRIS HAYES : They have this kind of like , yeah , I do n't like the boss or the big corporations or those or the Wall Street fat cats . And also I think that immigrants are kind of trying to get over on me . And kind of lazy and they 're bringing all their family in and maybe taking my jobs , right ? When you talk about giving people a sort of narrative or a framework that combines these questions of race and class , what does that mean ? <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : What it means is you have to talk about race . You ca n't be silent on it because the loudest racial narrative is a divisive one for white people . But it depends on what you 're talking about . For brown people , it 's a divisive narrative around black people . For some black people , it 's a divisive narrative around brown people . Like it 's not only white people who have negative opinions about other races . <p> CHRIS HAYES : The idea that like racist demagoguery and prejudice are limited to white people , obviously as a structural fact that 's about the structural white supremacy . But if you grew up in New York , you hear all sorts of crazy s--- . All sorts of crazy negative s--- from all kinds of people about all kinds of other people , that 's a constant . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah , do n't get me started on the Punjabis . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Right , exactly , right . And then you 'd just be like , what , what , what did you ? Or just like about the Puerto Ricans and the Dominicans or this or that and it 's like , damn dude . And you would be even like hanging with a friend who you 're cool with , and then he says something about the Chinese and you 're like , bro , what , what ? But it 's like , yeah , like that stuff is in ... those narratives are being cultivated all over the place , not just for white folks . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah . So you 've got to talk about race because it 's in our minds , it 's the way we think about ourselves and the world . You have to specifically talk about race . You ca n't have a colorblind economic populism or you 're not interrupting the dominant narrative . You have to explicitly call it out and explicitly call out the tool of division . And say that politicians are pointing the finger at immigrants and people of color while they pick your pocket . Say that they want us to blame other struggling families , who have the courage to move here and risk everything rather than put the blame with the corporations that gladly shipped our jobs overseas and still got big tax kickbacks . So you really do actually have to call out what Trump and the right wing are doing , so that people identify it when they get back in the car and they turn on right wing radio , right ? <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : You have to give them the tools to actually unmask the greed behind the racism . And then you need to , and this we found is particularly important for people of color actually , you need to actually remind people that working together across race , which is something that everyone is pretty hungry to do . There 's this latent desire for this division to go away . But that it 's effective and that it has won things in the past , because we 've been knocked down for so long it 's hard to see the sky . There is a serious sense of fatigue that we ca n't actually win anything that will meaningfully change our lives , if we could n't do that with Barack Obama in the office , White House for eight years , how are we going to do it for anybody less than him ? That 's really real for many people of color . So you need to actually give them hope . You need to actually remind people that we 've been able to win before and lives have been changed and things have gotten better . <p> CHRIS HAYES : I want to talk about sort of building this narrative and what it means in this moment , this moment of both crisis opportunity and also an election , right after we take this quick break . <p> CHRIS HAYES : So the race , class stuff that you did , you did see it in the mouths of a lot of candidates . Elizabeth Warren , Castro , Booker and Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders quite a bit . I mean , I actually think there was like a real evolution of the Bernie Sanders message from a much more kind of class first economic populism . That 's a side issue to a more explicit ... He had this whole thing about like they are trying to divide us . They want to divide us . They want to divide us by these ... and I thought actually that was the most effective , this sort of rhetorical sweet spot was when he was sort of leaning into that . But also , okay , so where is this message now in this whole thing , Because it 's so bizarre , right ? They 're trying to do it again , I do n't know how effective it is . <p> CHRIS HAYES : We 're in a just totally different world . While you were doing all this work on this , while I was covering the primary , the world we were in was a world of this like weird right wing populism married to corporatism , like a populous message and a corporatist policy . They 're suing to get rid of the ACA . They 're beating up on immigrants in every way they can to sort of make a spectacle of it . They go back to that whenever they get scared . The economy has got three and a half percent unemployment . The macro numbers look pretty good . Inequality is still pretty bad . Working people still struggling but doing better than they were , say eight years ago . What does that all add up to and now it 's like , I do n't know , what is it now ? I do n't know . It 's a scary new world . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : It 's a scary new world . A friend of mine said , it 's like the tide went out and you realized everybody was swimming naked . Even though those numbers were great , even though the stock market was doing great- <p> CHRIS HAYES : Great point . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : ... you still had people not actually able to pay their bills for one month if they could n't go to work . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Look at those food bank lines , that 's what that says . The food bank lines say , we have three and a half percent unemployment and a great economy a month ago , two weeks into quarantine , people need food from the food bank . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : That 's right . You had all of these businesses that actually were on such thin margins that even if they got through the hoops of all these ridiculous government programs funneled through banks , they could n't actually wait the three weeks to get it done without firing everybody . So the underlying inequality was not mitigated . The safety net was even in worse shambles than it was before . Because we continued to have stupid things like food stamp work requirements and Medicaid work requirements and the sequester , remember that ? When we did this grand bargain to just automatically chop off two percent of the budget , that 's still been going on . Public programs have been operating at a razor thin edge for so long and it 's all been revealed . The ways in which the backbone of our economy has been for two generations now , a service sector that is primarily and disproportionately women , people of color and immigrants , who now suddenly , not being the disrespected under $15 an hour workers are suddenly are essential workers . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And they 're the only people who are going outside and going to work and they 're doing so without hazard pay , without paid leave , without all the things that ... without masks and gloves and hand sanitizer . They 're working at Amazon warehouses and getting fired for speaking up while the richest person on the planet is at the head of that corporation . They do n't have anything that Ro Khanna and Elizabeth Warren 's bill that they have , the essential worker 's bill of rights , these are basic things , right ? These are not trying to make millionaires out of delivery drivers . These are things that any worker should have on a good day . And certainly the only workers who are putting themselves out on the line every single day to keep families safe and healthy and fed , of course they should have . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And yet that still has not passed Congress . And we are in a moment I think of strange bipartisan agreement in weird corners of our politics , both out in the public and with , single Republican members of Congress and senators saying things like , we should have a guaranteed income until this is all over . And yet we have the fear of God struck into the hearts of the Republican billionaire class that is really willing to let 50,000 more Americans die in order to make sure that the stock market is functioning well and that Americans do n't build a safety net right now that will stay after the pandemic is over . <p> CHRIS HAYES : That is one of the most ghoulish and gob smacking aspects in the moment . I do think sometimes , you 're talking about the protest , I do think there 's a little bit of , they have succeeded in doing a psych job in terms of like how expansive that view is . And I think they buy their own b------- a little bit to their detriment . I think they think that like there 's this hunger , a great American awakening to go out and like work in the face of a virus and maybe die in a plague . And I do n't think that 's actually why . And I also think that , actually if you even surveyed a bunch of CEOs , they 'd be like , Macy 's in Georgia is not reopening . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Yeah , right . <p> CHRIS HAYES : They 're not idiots . But what I do think is the ideological bedrock here , which is your watching right wing restlessness with a collective communal project that is done for public safety and health , at the cost to the market and commercial life . And it drives them nuts and they hate it and they 're getting restless and they do n't want to keep doing it because commercial life ... And part of that critique , we all get , I want to go to a G------ baseball game . I want to take my daughter to the concert that I bought her tickets for . I want my brother to get married this summer . Like everybody wants all of that . A lot of it 's probably not going to happen . But these moments of weird truth-telling from like the Stephen Moore 's of the world- <p> CHRIS HAYES : Weird truth telling from the Stephen Moores of the world and these others , where it 's like , " No , no , you must offer up your body on the altar of the market of commercial life , of normalcy . " Like Chuck Grassley talking about how worried he is about the fate of the pigs that have nowhere to go because of the people getting sick in the pork processing plant . <p> CHRIS HAYES : And it 's like , " Okay bro , I get it . You represent a bunch of pig farmers and yes , it 's a problem that their pigs do n't have anywhere to go , but our area of primary concern are these sick workers in the pork processing plant . Right dude ? " And not even pretending that 's the case . Just been like , " I talked to farmers , and I 'm like , what are we going to do the pigs , what are we going to do the pigs ? " I 'm like , " I get it . That 's a real concern , but there are hundreds of people sick in these pork processing plants . " <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Gosh . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Just these moments where the sheer dehumanizing force of the ideological agenda , which is often not so explicitly stated , just keeps getting explicitly stated , and it 's so shocking to hear it so loud . You 're like , " No ... " And also not just shocking to see , but I will say this , not popular . I just do n't ... For all of the rhetorical dexterity they have and the persuasiveness and appeal of the message , which you have been talking about , go sacrifice your body for the stock market to go up , it 's like , no , the perspective is not a good one , that 's not one of their best arrows in their quiver , but that 's the one they 've been going with . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : But for black people , I have to say that message is one that our ancestors , that 's been the story of America for us . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Literally , yeah . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Literally . And so when you think , where does this come from ? Why is this being so naked and so cruel right now ? Where does this belief , particularly among people who have a lot of money , that other people 's lives are easy fodder to make more money . That does come back to the ideology of racial slavery . It does . <p> CHRIS HAYES : It 's like throw a log in the fire . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : As does the idea that you should have a minimum wage so low that someone ca n't feed their family after working all day . That same idea that the labor of some people is only valuable in as much as it provides profit to the owner class and in fact they should not gain really even just a modicum of the rewards for their labor . That idea , when you start out at zero in slavery , we 're at 7.25 now , we 've made a heck of a lot of progress in 200 years . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : We really have to reckon with an ideology that was born from gross exploitation , whether it 's colonialism or slavery , that still has some of its echoes in a way that many of the people who are justifying their social position are leading their lives today . I 'm writing a chapter , my book , " The Sum Of Us " is coming out next February , the Ted Talk , which is called " Racism Has A Cost For Everyone , " I tell these stories , I 'm still gathering more stories of course , because now I have to add something about the public health crisis that we 're in . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : One of the things that I 've been researching is , why it is that white men are the climate deniers ? If you look at why the United States is not doing more on climate change , it is basically because over the past 20 years the Republican Party has become the only political party in the world , including other conservative parties , that not only want a market based solution to climate change , but just says it 's not really happening , they do n't believe it . And what is it about that party , which is 90 percent white , and over indexes among men , and white men , that this climate denialism is so important . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And what some sociologists have found is that it comes down to something called social dominance orientation , where you actually just believe that some groups of people are better than others , and you justify your own position in society . And that means that you do n't think that something that is bad that is happening is going to affect you because you 've seen bad things not affect you before . And in fact it inflates your sense of security , gives you a false sense of security and a false lack of empathy towards people who have been suffering and are suffering . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And I think that 's exactly what 's happening right now where there 's this , " Oh wait , now it 's just people with preexisting conditions and people who are already sick and hurt . " The echoes of the healthcare crisis is like , " I do n't want the healthy people to have to pay for the sick , " as if the sick are a different species as opposed to just us before we trip and fall down the stairs . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Oh , the COVID ? <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Exactly . There 's that social Darwinism , that social dominance orientation , that is a killer . It is a killer . It is causing the planet to fundamentally shift in ways that are inhospitable to human and animal life , and in this current pandemic , it is making the " greatest country on earth , " the richest country on the earth , the worst at responding to this pandemic and protecting our own people . I do n't think Donald Trump has had a moment of grief about 50,000 people who have lost their lives on his watch . <p> CHRIS HAYES : That part of it ... And it 's not just him , because he strikes me as a person who 's genuinely , to a degree , that I find morosely fascinating , actually incapable , I think , of feeling human empathy . He 's certainly capable of displaying it genuinely , I do n't know what ... I ca n't look inside his heart but he seems to struggle with it . But the degree to which , I said this on Twitter , of the idea that you would go around after 9/11 and be like , " Well , you know the flu kills 50,000 people a year . Do you know the flu kills ... Look , we have swimming pools , we 've got car accidents , we got cigarettes . Really , I do n't get what everyone 's so sad about . " <p> CHRIS HAYES : People would have punched you in the face , you would have lost your job , you would have been spit on , and people also would have been like , " You 're a sociopath . You 're a sociopath . What the f--- is wrong with you ? " And yet here we are , people I know , our loved ones , people I work with , people that we all know , famous people , not famous people , frontline workers , cops and firefighters , MTA workers , nurses and doctors , blah blah , and it 's just like they do n't care . <p> CHRIS HAYES : They 're f------ running around telling us how many people die every year from the flu and from cigarettes , and from pools and it 's like , good God . That part of it has been so horrifying to me , and so , at a human level , heartbreaking , it 's as heartbreaking ... It 's like the grief is heartbreaking and the lack of mourning and grief and solidarity is doubly heartbreaking , where it 's like , wow , they really do n't care . They really do n't care about this calamity that 's befalling us . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : This is an invitation to solidarity . And you know that that 's the case when you see the corporations ads , which just changed and turned over in the past few weeks to all COVID-19 ads . And you have Walmart associates all singing Lean On Me into their smartphones . That 's just the message . " We 're all in it together , " is what Colgate is saying , and Tide is saying . If you wanted some weathervane as to what is the dominant narrative that Madison Avenue , as we used to call it , is hearing , is what people want to hear right now , it is that , it is solidarity , it is we are all in it together . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And I think about the mask . So we were all finally told to wear masks and our instinct is , it 's to protect ourselves , because that 's what we do , we protect ourselves , we try to put on armor and we try to shield ourselves from this dangerous thing . And what is slowly being revealed in fits and starts is that actually it 's to protect other people , which means that wearing a mask is an act of solidarity and protection to others . Even if you do n't feel sick , you should wear mask because you might get someone sick who , either because they have preexisting conditions , or because that 's just the way things happen . They could get very sick from something that has n't made you sick . <p> CHRIS HAYES : And that 's why I thought it was such a ... And I hate , I actively dislike the feeling of a mask , and I 've been wearing it for that reason and ... So there is this little , in a weird way it 's like we all have sacrificed . And I am enormously privileged and sacrificed at no level , at the level of grocery workers and nurses , but everyone , to a certain extent , has disrupted their normal lives . Again , together we have , and the mask wearing , there is a collective engagement in the public project to care for all of us together that ordinary people across the various divisions that divide our society have undertaken collectively in a way that is actually quite inspiring . <p> CHRIS HAYES : We have , Republican , Democrat , right-wingers and left-wingers , black , white and Latino , rich and poor ... Again , it does n't mean those divisions do n't matter , it does n't mean that it 's hitting everyone the same way , it clearly is n't . But as a collective innercise and collective response , there has been a remarkable amount of unity of purpose , which is why the brand- <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Because we are actually all humans , and our human bodies- <p> CHRIS HAYES : Our human bodies do n't want to die in a plague . And not only that do we not want to die on the plague , we do n't want others to die in the plague . We do n't want to pass off the plague , we do n't want to be a vector of someone 's sickness , we do n't want the infirm and immunocompromise and people in nursing homes , who we do n't know , to get sick because of us . We do n't want that . We genuinely do n't want that . And that is the hopeful part of this whole thing to me . There is just genuine decency and concern for other people 's lives that is on display everywhere . And I find that that part of it inspiring . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : It is absolutely inspiring , the tens of thousands of people who had hung up their stethoscopes years before surge back in to volunteer to go to New York . I 've had an oddly high number of friends who are doctors and nurses and public health officials , it 's the most common job of my close friends , and hearing their stories of just , " This is what the moment we were prepared for . This is the moment we were made for . " It feels like it 's an invitation to solidarity . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : I think one of the things that we 've done poorly is that we have n't given everyday people enough more to do actually , because I think that that desire to be helpful is so high right now . These were not the times that we ever knew , because we were born into Reagan and just moved on from there , but there was a time when people were buying war bonds and planting victory gardens . And there was a time when everybody was moving across the country in order to be a part of an effort that was bigger than them . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And I think that 's what we 're going to need to do . I think about the New York , you and I both live in New York , you 're from New York , I 'm from Chicago originally . But I think about the city that is going to have to be rebuilt , and just how much I would be willing to do for that , and how much I hope that our government is able to give us ways to be a part of the solution , because this country is going to have to be rebuilt . It 's going to have to mourn , which is just so crazy , the lack of mourning . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : There 's no moments of silence before these press briefings , there 's no names being read or scrolling across the top , there 's nothing , it 's like we are in a plague . Every time I open up my Facebook feed , there 's someone else 's auntie who has died . And yet there 's no public official counting of that , we need to obviously do that , and we need to roll up our sleeves . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : I think we 're going to be in a great depression , on top of the pandemic . And I just ... The public projects that came out of that period with the new deal are what are going to need to be on the horizon . I think we need to take the fact that fossil fuels are trading at so low and actually have the government buy them , not bail them out , but buy them . <p> CHRIS HAYES : Buy and shut them down . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : Buy them and shut them down and- <p> CHRIS HAYES : Just keep the workers . <p> HEATHER MCGHEE : And keep the workers and retrain them , and let 's save the planet . Let 's actually act like the greatest country in the world . <p> CHRIS HAYES : We 've got to think big . Heather McGee is a senior distinguished fellow at Demos .

But , as Mark Jennings writes , it has spared its struggling TV arm -- at least for now . <p> Staff at MediaWorks TV must be thankful the owners are still trying to sell that part of the business . The drawn-out process has saved their jobs . Instead , MediaWorks is taking the blade to its profitable radio operation and its outdoor advertising company , QMS . <p> CEO Michael Anderson spoke to staff via a video link on Monday morning and broke the news that 130 " friends and colleagues " would be leaving the business . While not quite untouchable , the profitable radio business has , to a large degree , been insulated , from the constant cost cutting of the last five years . <p> The relative stability of MediaWorks radio , which includes The Edge , The Breeze , The Rock and More FM stations , has helped it get the better of its duopoly competitor NZME .

@@31858841 <h> Air New Zealand liquidity and 2020 earnings update <p> Air New Zealand is today providing an update on its actions to reduce cash burn , as well as earnings expectations for the 2020 financial year following the precipitous decline in demand for air travel that has resulted from the outbreak of Covid-19 . <p> Liquidity position <p> Prior to the outbreak of Covid-19 , Air New Zealand was in a strong position with a resilient balance sheet and short-term liquidity of more than $1 billion . The airline has no financial covenants on new or existing debt facilities and no significant debt maturities until 2022 . The airline has taken and will continue to take swift and decisive action to preserve and enhance liquidity and minimise cash burn . <p> As previously disclosed to the market , once the initial restrictions for international travel into New Zealand were announced in March 2020 , Air New Zealand moved quickly to secure a loan facility of up to $900 million with the New Zealand Government , to bolster liquidity and provide the airline with sufficient flexibility to respond to a range of potential demand recovery scenarios . <p> As at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately $640 million , which does not include any funds from the $900 million loan facility with the Government . <p> " We have not yet needed to draw down on the government loan facility , as we continue to utilise all available levers to reduce our cash burn and right-size the business to reflect the expectation that , for some time , our airline will be smaller than it was pre Covid-19 " says Chief Financial Officer Jeff McDowall . <p> The airline has already implemented a number of actions across every aspect of its cost base and capital expenditure portfolio , including : <p> * Labour reductions of approximately 30 percent , or 4,000 employees , which is expected to drive annualised savings of $350 to $400 million <p> * Suspension of all short-term incentive schemes for the 2020 financial year <p> * Reduction of the Executive team by 30 percent <p> * A 15 percent reduction in the salary of the Chief Executive and Executive team , together with a 15 percent reduction in Director fees through to December 2020 <p> * Institution of a hiring freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost $700 million in expected capital expenditure to December 2022 , including deferrals of planned A321 NEO deliveries <p> * Decision to ground the airline 's Boeing 777-200 and 777-300 fleet until at least the end of calendar 2020 <p> * Reductions across all other areas of the airline 's cost base including cancellation of all non-essential spend , reduction in leasing costs and modification of various vendor and supplier terms . <p> As a result of the above actions , Air New Zealand expects to reduce its average monthly cash outflows by approximately $50 million to $60 million1 for the 2021 financial year . <p> " Like all businesses at this time , we find ourselves facing an environment where revenues will be a small fraction of what we are accustomed to . Over the course of the last few months we have acted at pace to implement both short-term and structural cost saving measures to adapt to this new environment , and we will continue to seek out further opportunities to consolidate facilities , reduce capital spend , review fleet composition , supply chain costs and adjust our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for air travel will eventually rebound , so we are cognisant of striking the right balance between removing cost from the business and ensuring the airline is in a strong position to ramp up as demand recovers " says Mr McDowall . <p> 2020 Earnings update and outlook <p> The airline had a solid start to the 2020 financial year , however market conditions deteriorated dramatically in early March as the spread of Covid-19 began to extend globally . That led the airline to confirm on 9 March 2020 that it was withdrawing any full year earnings guidance . <p> " Across March and April , Air New Zealand reduced its network capacity by more than 95 percent as demand declined to almost zero following the implementation of the New Zealand government 's travel restrictions2 . The recent move to Alert Level 2 has been a welcome reprieve , allowing us to get the domestic engine turning again , however it is clear that it will take some time for demand to return to pre-Covid levels . We are preparing for a scenario in which the airline is still 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Mr McDowall . <p> For the second half of the 2020 financial year , Air New Zealand 's network capacity is expected to be approximately 50 percent lower than the prior comparative period , driven by a reduction of approximately 90 percent in the fourth quarter . In light of this and the fact there was very little revenue coming in during Alert Levels 3 and 4 , the airline is now expecting to report an underlying loss for the 2020 financial year . <p> Given there is still a high degree of uncertainty regarding demand for air travel under New Zealand 's Alert Level 2 , the period of time in which social distancing will be required on the aircraft and the timing of a shift to Alert Level 1 , the airline will not be providing specific 2020 earnings guidance at this time . <p> Other significant items <p> On 28 January , Air New Zealand provided an initial estimate of the Other Significant Items that it expected to report in its financial results for 2020 . The airline is now expecting to recognise hedge losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 . As per the airline 's update on 28 January , these items are not included in the airline 's calculation of underlying earnings for the 2020 financial year . These estimates have been updated in the table below to reflect current expectations , however , are still subject to further review by both the airline and its auditors . <p> De-designation of hedges Air New Zealand 's Group policy is to hedge up to 90 percent of its expected fuel consumption for the next three months , falling to a maximum of 30 percent after twelve months . With passenger demand at historical lows , the airline sought to maximise utilisation of aircraft by operating charter and repatriation flights , as well as deploying passenger aircraft on cargo-only missions to deliver New Zealand products to other countries and bring critical medical supplies back into the New Zealand market . Despite this , there has been a substantial reduction in overall capacity , and accordingly fuel consumption , which has resulted in fuel hedge losses for the period . These losses were partially offset by gains from closing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures which are no longer expected to occur <p> The net impact of these items for the 2020 financial year is currently estimated to be in the range of $85 million to $105 million . This amount will vary if there are significant fluctuations in fuel prices or foreign exchange rates . The airline currently has un-hedged foreign currency debt as a consequence of the de-designation of revenue hedges resulting from a decline in expected foreign currency revenues . These liabilities are subject to translation risk as the liabilities are revalued each month . Gains or losses which were previously reflected in the airline 's Cash Flow Hedge Reserve will now be reflected in the Statement of Financial Performance . Fluctuations in foreign currency rates preclude the airline from providing an estimated impact at this time , but any amount will be reported within Other Significant Items . Aircraft impairment charge Air New Zealand anticipates that global demand for international air travel will rebuild slowly . As such , the airline expects to book an impairment charge in the 2020 financial year relating to some of its Boeing 777 aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to these aircraft in the range of $350 million to $450 million , which will be partially offset by a reduction in the airline 's deferred tax liability . Assessment of the impairment charge is underway as part of the 2020 annual results process and will be reviewed by the auditors . More information will be provided when the airline releases its annual results later this year . <p> Reorganisation costs The airline had previously announced reorganisation costs in the range of $20 million to $25 million for the 2020 financial year . Following the swift decline in demand for air travel resulting from Covid19 , the airline has confirmed reductions of approximately 30 percent of its workforce , which is expected to bring the total reorganisation cost for the year to a range of $140 million to $160 million . <p> CEO commentary Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran says that the Covid-19 pandemic has had an unparalleled impact on the aviation industry , and the future landscape of the airline will look vastly different to what it does today . <p> " This is without a doubt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aviation industry , has ever faced . The implementation of domestic travel restrictions and border closures have been incredibly effective at slowing the spread of Covid-19 in a number of countries , including here in New Zealand , but they have also had a profound impact on demand for air travel . <p> " Throughout this pandemic , Air New Zealand 's focus has first and foremost been on protecting the health and safety of our customers and our team , while also taking swift and decisive action to protect the long term viability of the airline and preserve liquidity . We are doing everything in our power to ensure Air New Zealand emerges strongly from this crisis . <p> " I am extremely grateful to our team of Air New Zealanders who have remained focused on getting our business up and running again and providing the high standard of customer service and care that we are known for , through what can only be described as an extraordinarily difficult time . <p> " As we farewell a large number of our talented and immensely hard-working people from all areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thank everyone for their exceptional service to Air New Zealand . <p> " I also want to take this opportunity to thank our customers - we know it has n't been an easy time for anyone amidst this crisis . As we begin to operate more flights our immediate priority is ensuring customer safety and restoring your confidence and desire to travel . There is no playbook for the situation we are currently facing , so we need to create our own .

@@31859241 <p> More than 80 per cent of India 's farmers are small and marginal farmers , who own less than 5 acres of land . Individually , because of the size of the landholding , they are underrepresented and do n't have access to a host of services such as access to affordable credit and affordable warehousing , which farmers with larger farms do . Amidst the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown , fear of falling prices of food grains , drop in exports and lower demand have created a distress situation across communities of these farmers . On the other hand , marginal farmers who are getting ready for the upcoming sowing season are in urgent need of credit for inputs and for the sustenance of their own families . <p> Rang De and NDTV have come together and initiated a campaign #RangDeIndia to highlight the impending crisis faced by India 's farmers . It is also a clarion call to ordinary citizens of India to join hands in support of these small and marginal farmers . By providing interest-free loans to farmers in distress situation , the campaign aims to ensure that they are able to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis , while at the same time carry on with their farming . <p> As a part of the campaign , a 2-hour special telethon was also organised to raise funds that will help reach out to these vulnerable people during this tough time of the pandemic . Experts , social workers and celebrities came together to discuss the impact of coronavirus on our farmers , who ensure that we continue to have food on our table , and how everyone can come together and make sure that the farmer 's family does not go hungry . <p> Joining the telethon with NDTV 's Dr Prannoy Roy , Dr GV Ramanjaneyulu , Founder &amp; Executive Director at the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture highlighted how the beginning of the lockdown affected the harvest season for the farmers and the challenges faced by them , he said , <p> Farmers are in deep crisis . We see daily that a number of migrants are on the road who are part of the rural economy . About 54.6 per cent of the population is dependent on agriculture and 87 per cent are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The income of an average farmer is 8,931 per month . The lockdown has affected this income by about 60 per cent . <p> Further talking about the crisis that the farmers are facing , Dr GV Ramanjaneyulu added , <p> Some farmers were unable to sell their produce as transport was affected in the lockdown due to coronavirus . Particularly fresh vegetables and fruit sector have been affected significantly in this time . Many farmers are landless and they take land on lease for which they pay high interests . <p> Dr. Nachiket Mor , PhD , Visiting Scientist , The Banyan Academy of Leadership in Mental Health stressed on the fact that our farmers are in distress , given the situation today . Explaining the term ' peer to peer lending ' which is a relatively a new concept in India , Dr. Nachiket Mor said , <p> What is happening with your money and how is the money being spent is an important component of peer to peer lending . In a regular lending context , you are looking at the lowest risk borrowing . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are most needy and bridge a gap by allowing farmers and those who are in distress to do something new with mentorship and support . Using technology to ensure transparency in peer to peer lending , one can actually see the individual and you can help that individual directly , not just with money but also with an idea or skill that you have and want to help them with . <p> Vinita Bali , Former CEO &amp; MD , Britannia Industries Ltd talking about the role of social investments for India 's farmers said , <p> I think the biggest attractive feature of social investment is that it is not impersonal , it is very personal and you can put a face to the situation you want to change . It will bring the habit of giving . It involves civil society in a very easy way . I just have to write a cheque to Rang de or transfer money . It is easy to help those who feed us . It is a brilliant way of connecting and getting more and more people involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We are buying rations directly from farmers , this is the direct relief as they are getting the money directly which is very essential at this point of time as they are not able to sell their produce because of the lockdown . <p> I was n't really aware earlier but after lockdown when I started cooking myself , I started wondering where are these people who are growing vegetables and food grains . I realised how much far we are from our farmers . I personally do n't know any farmers . But initiatives like Rang De helps us to know them personally . <p> Highlighting how everyone can help support the one who provides us with food - our farmers , Adil Hussain , Actor added , <p> I know how difficult it is to produce something from the soil . What has distressed me the most is the distress faced by the farmers , farmers suicide and how we have accepted this . When I came to know about Rang de India , I got to know how one can help the farmers as these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have not been able to do anything due to the lockdown sitting in Delhi but through such initiative , we can bring a change . We all must come forward and invest whatever amount we can . It is a sacred responsibility . <p> Talking about the Rang De India model and how it plans to reach out to the farmers , Ram NK , Co-Founder &amp; MD , Rang De said , <p> In 2006 , we wanted to come back to India and do something for society . We noticed that the credit was very very expensive and we narrowed down to building a platform that can ease borrowing for the needy . At Rang De , we partner with an organisation who help us reach the farmers and we transfer the money int he bank accounts of the farmers . You can also see how your money is being spent and who is being helped in a very transparent way . <p> It is extremely important that we take time out from our lives to help those in need , be it the migrant workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also joined the telethon and stressed how we as a community should come together and ensure that our farmers are able to take care of themselves and their families in this tough time , he said , <p> Seasonal problem is very high for farmers , like in my village itself , there are farmers who have faced high rainfall because of which wheat got rotten in the farm itself . It is very important for all of us who can help support these vulnerable people . <p> Abhijit Banerjee , Nobel Laureate in Economics stressed on the fact that the farmers need a good support system and added , <p> As far as relief measures are concerned , I think the government should have gone further because a lot of people who rely on agriculture are not recognised as farmers . So identifying only farmers will not be enough . Middle-class rural India has fallen into poverty . If you try to target you will miss the most affected .

@@31860141 <p> General Motors Co. is delaying the start of second production shifts at two pickup plants as auto manufacturers trying to ramp up production after weeks-long shutdowns struggle to procure enough parts . <p> GM originally planned to run two shifts next week at the factories in Fort Wayne , Indiana , and Flint , Michigan , according to a spokesman . While a sport-utility vehicle facility elsewhere in its home state is still on track to boost output , the truck plants may need to give suppliers in Mexico that have been resuming work more slowly another week to catch up . <p> The delay will further crimp supply of GM 's redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups and is the latest supplier-related disruption to hit automakers that have been restarting operations that were shut down for weeks . Ford Motor Co. , Daimler AG 's Mercedes-Benz and Volvo have had to pause some U.S. production because of parts shortages . <p> " There is strong demand for our full-size pickups and we will look to add capacity as quickly as we can , " said Dan Flores , GM 's spokesman . The automaker 's shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . <p> Ford paused production for the second time in as many days at its Explorer SUV plant in Chicago earlier this week after a worker at a nearby supplier facility tested positive for Covid-19 . <p> For GM , Mercedes and Volvo the issue has been Mexico 's restart . The nation 's government has issued conflicting and vague decrees on what factories need to do before they 're allowed to reopen , contributing to delays that have slowed production at U.S. factories reliant on imported parts . <p> The constraints led Mercedes to suspend production of GLS and GLE SUVs and C-Class sedans in Alabama this week , while Volvo was forced to temporarily idle its S60 sedan factory in South Carolina . <p> Strong Silverado and Sierra sales buoyed GM 's first-quarter earnings and gave analysts hope that Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra could eke out a full-year profit .

@@31860241 <h> Enugu , Imo recorded highest form of violations by security agencies -- NHRC <h> By Johnbosco Agbakwuru , Abuja <p> THE National Human Rights Commission , NHRC , has said that Enugu and Imo states recorded the highest form of human rights violations by the security agencies during the lockdown to contain the spread of Coronavirus pandemic . <p> This is as the commission has also alleged that extortion by security agencies was high in the two states and some other states of the federation during the lockdown . <p> Speaking exclusively to Vanguard , the Deputy Director , Monitoring , NHRC , Richmond Iheme , said that the curtailment of human rights has to be just and reasonable for the public good and to the extent necessary in a democratic society . <p> Mr. Iheme observed that the first phase of the lockdown of two weeks recorded more human rights violations than the second phase and the one-week extension , adding that the outcry and condemnation of such infractions may have contributed to the reduction in the subsequent phase . <p> He recalled that about 105 human rights violations were reported within two weeks of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission , while the second phase of another two weeks and the next extension by one week recorded 104 human rights violations were reported across the country . <p> According to him , " Various factors may account for it . You will recall that after the release of the first report by the National Human Rights Commission where extrajudicial killings mainly were reported against law enforcement agencies besides other violations ; there was so much public outcry , so much condemnation against such infractions , and unlawful killings by security agencies who ought to indeed protect lives . There was so much condemnation that trailed the release of that first report . <p> " Following that , expectedly the high command of the various security agencies had a responsibility to call their officers to order and they seem to have done that as was shown in their conduct during the second phase of enforcing the lockdown . <p> " So , calling to order of the security agencies by their high command seems to have resulted in the seeming reduction in the violations recorded during the second phase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase of the report . " <p> On why Enugu and Imo were said to have recorded the highest number of violations by security agencies , Mr. Iheme attributed it to the excessive use of force in the affected areas . <p> He said , " It shows the pattern of the violations that had occurred in these places and indeed in other parts of the Federation and you will see that incidents of excessive or disproportionate use of force , torture , inhuman and degrading treatment , seizure and confiscation of property , arrest and unlawful detention extortion , were high in those states <p> " People who flouted the ' stay at home order ' were arrested and extorted . People were also detained and extorted before they were released . These account to the pattern of violation you find in Enugu , Imo as well as other places . " <p> He noted that the Police were mainly implicated in these infractions , adding that what the commission was canvassing was to ensure accountability in law enforcement . <p> " If accountability is ensured if people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held to account if they are reprimanded if they are brought to book and held to justice to account for their misdeeds , to account for their misconduct or unprofessional deeds in the course of enforcement , the police on the field would see that you ca n't get away with impunity anymore . <p> " You ca n't get away with lawlessness in the course of enforcing the law anymore , they ca n't get away with high handedness or excessive use of force , you ca n't get away with unlawful conduct anymore . <p> " That is indeed where we look forward to getting to . We look forward to a situation where law enforcement officers that break the law in the course of enforcing the law are held to account and brought to justice . Unless this is done , impunity will thrive . <p> " So , to the extent that such accountability continues , the level of infractions would likely continue to reduce but if this is not done , we would go back where we were and that is an era of impunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Asked how the various agencies and even the government and the people could build on the improvement recorded during the last phases of the lockdown , he said , " One , the importance of compliance with human rights standards in the course of law enforcement needs not to be overemphasized . <p> " It is important that law enforcement officers comply with minimum human rights benchmarks in the course of law enforcement . <p> " You can not break the law in the course of enforcing the law . And persons who commit violations in the course of enforcement ought to be brought to book , they ought to be held responsible for their violations . <p> " It would be unfortunate if infractions are swept under the carpet , If persons who commit human rights violations are not held accountable , impunity will be the order of the day . So , bringing perpetrators to account is one sure way of deterring others from committing similar infractions . <p> " Secondly , it is important to properly brief security operatives -- debrief them before deploying them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deployed to enforce the lockdown were not properly briefed on what to do in the course of the enforcement . <p> " They seem to be carrying out the enforcement as if it were routine law enforcement without realizing the peculiar circumstance of the COVID-19 lockdown enforcement . <p> " So appropriate debriefing before deployment will also be helpful in curbing infractions ... " <p> On the various types of violations report of the commission was talking about , Iheme said , " The report collated within the period of monitoring the lockdown enforcement covers a range of human rights thematic areas . <p> " This includes extrajudicial killings , inhuman and degrading treatment , right to dignity of the human person and freedom from torture , inhuman and degrading treatment , unlawful seizure and confiscation of property , unlawful detention , extortion , access to justice concerns among others . There were issues of domestic violence too . <p> " Let it be noted that the report shows documented cases of violations by the commission , it does n't in any way claim to be all the violations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there must have been other violations that occurred but these are the violations that were monitored and documented by the National Human Rights Commission . <p> " Recall particularly that when the initial report was released and 18 deaths were recorded to have occurred during that first phase , Femi Falana , a Senior Advocate of Nigeria had drawn attention that there were three other deaths that had occurred too . Some other civil society organizations would have also recorded some violations in the course of the enforcement of the lockdown . " <p> The second phase report showed 11 extrajudicial killings were documented by Monitors during the second period out of which the Nigerian Police were allegedly responsible for 7 deaths . <h> Related <p> All rights reserved .

@@31860441 <h> Retirement in the Age of Coronavirus <p> Who says you ca n't teach a dog a new trick ? This damnable coronavirus has fostered a desperate need to connect with others , and nowhere is that more urgent than among those of us who have retired . After all , this was my time to relax and enjoy the relationships and activities I had put on hold for so many years while I worked to make retirement possible . And , now , here I was -- stuck at home with no gatherings with family and friends , no vacations , no classes , no visits to yoga , the pool , or the gym . Say it ai n't so ! <p> But then , with lightening speed , here came Zoom ! Before this , even in the workplace , I had not heard of Zoom . I did occasionally participate in Skype meetings , and had just recently begun using Face Time with my son and his friend . Zoom changed all of that and opened up the world while the virus raged on . With a relatively short learning curve , I have now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social gatherings . Do n't get me wrong -- Zoom will never replace being with real people . But I have to admit it has been a boost to know that there are windows into the world I used to know ! <p> My first Zoom experience replaced Game Night for a group of friends who were used to a twice-monthly chance to gather , share food we each had made , and play card and board games ( or just sit at the now-empty dining room table and talk incessantly with buddies whom you had n't seen in two weeks ! ) . I downloaded the app and was excited to see the oversized Zoom logo cover the screen . When the time came to join the meeting , it did n't go completely as planned . I had to ask for the link again , and felt like a kid when I saw various members of the group jump on . All of us spent some time playing with what we could do using the Zoom tools -- the thumbs up and two hand clapping being my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all when their backdrops featured beautiful scenes of the ocean and the mountains . Of course , I had to find that button . <p> It takes a little practice to understand how to control the conversation on Zoom , especially with a gregarious bunch who wants to talk all the time . But there 's always one in the group who simply takes charge . We shared some great laughs as members talked at length without their microphones on , or could n't get the camera turned back onto their faces . In all honesty , we only had a few minutes to catch up on what each of us has been doing since last we met . But now we knew we could master this Zoom , and take over the world again . We became Baby Zoomers that night , and life took on a whole new adventure even as we sheltered-in-place.
@@31860541 <p> The Industrial Midwest was always going to be a battleground in November . <p> The region is now becoming a new front line for Americans ' lives and livelihoods as coronavirus hot spots proliferate and jobless rates spiral . The confluence of a ferocious pandemic , deepening economic turmoil and rising political tensions is more pronounced here than anywhere else in the country . And it sets the stage for a combustible campaign season that is testing President Donald Trump 's efforts to move on and insulate himself from the crisis -- and Joe Biden 's ability to blame him for the fallout . <p> Advertisement <p> On Thursday , Trump ventured to a swing county in Pennsylvania , stopping off at a Lehigh Valley medical equipment distributor where he used an official speech to mock " Sleepy Joe , " chastise governors for moving too slowly to reopen and assail the news media as a " disaster " while touting American workers . <p> " I say it 's the ' transition to greatness . ' The transition is the third quarter , " Trump said . " The fourth quarter is going to do very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof . " <p> The numbers and interviews , however , paint a much grimmer picture . The virus has moved from urban centers like Detroit and Chicago into suburbs and more sparsely populated counties , a trend seen from western Pennsylvania to Minnesota and Iowa . In Wisconsin , Michigan and Pennsylvania -- Democrats ' so-called " Blue Wall " -- 19 counties report coronavirus cases doubling in less than 14 days . Trump won all but one of those counties , by an average of 65 percent . <p> Democrats are working to ensure that does n't happen again by casting his stewardship over the virus and economy as a betrayal . <p> Sen. Sherrod Brown . Susan Walsh/AP Photo <p> " There are so many things Trump has done to attack the labor movement to undermine and betray workers , " Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D-Ohio ) told POLITICO . " And since the coronavirus , he 's done nothing to help the essential workers . " <p> The region has been devastated by job losses amid pandemic-induced economic shutdowns , in some cases far outpacing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have applied for unemployment benefits since mid-March . <p> In Michigan , more than 3 in 10 workers have sought aid in the past two months , according to a POLITICO analysis of Labor Department data . Layoffs and furloughs are also piling up in Pennsylvania , where more than one-fourth of the workforce -- or 29.6 percent -- has filed an unemployment claim . <p> Minnesota and Ohio , too , are both seeing more than one in five workers applying for unemployment benefits , though they both fall slightly below the national average of 22 percent . <p> Overall , however , the public has remained solidly behind governors who are urging caution , giving them high marks for their performances while their assessments of Trump 's handling of the outbreak sag . <p> And private surveys conducted by both parties and described to POLITICO show concerns about the virus and health care running ahead of worries over the economy . <p> In interviews , public health officials across the states said that while the infection data is trending in the right direction in many areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in cases and deaths as cities and states begin to reopen businesses . <p> Personal protective equipment also remains a problem in many jurisdictions , health officials say , and there are fears of how rural areas with rising caseloads and fewer hospitals will manage future outbreaks , particularly in Michigan , where health officials are starting to see spikes in rural counties . <p> The economic fallout is expected to be even more long-lasting , casting a shadow over the presidential election . Biden has maintained polling leads over Trump in Wisconsin , Pennsylvania and Michigan , while public polling of Ohio has been scarce . <p> " The way I 've come to terms with what happened in 2016 in these working-class areas is that the Trump vote was a vote of despair and desperation . And that despair and desperation remain in 2020 , " said Paul Clark , director of the School of Labor and Employment Relations at Penn State University . " The big question is , will people in those areas react in the same way that they reacted in 2016 ... or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing my best to keep morale up , but this is tough , " said Don Furko , president of the United Steelworkers Local 1557 in Clairton , Pennsylvania , outside of Pittsburgh . " This is basically the toughest thing that 's happened to the steel industry since they started closing down steel mills in the 70s and 80s . " <p> In some industries -- construction and building trades , for example -- workers are used to long breaks between jobs , and many have filed for unemployment in the past . But the abrupt nature of the country 's shutdown threw many out of work with little warning , leaving them without time to prepare . <p> " You usually have some sort of notice when you 're headed towards unemployment -- you can save up some money , you can try to line up work ahead of time , " said Ryan Bennett , who 's in charge of roughly 800 active and 200 retired plumbers and pipefitters as part of UA Local 174 in Coopersville , Michigan , outside of Grand Rapids . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Bennett said roughly half of his workforce had jobs grind to a halt when the shutdown began . The uncertainty around what , if any , added benefits the federal government would provide , paired with slowdowns in filing for unemployment aid at the state agency , only added to the pain . " It 's been very difficult here in Michigan , " he said . <p> One of the only major industrial Midwest states seeing a lower-than-average claims rate is Wisconsin , according to the analysis , which compared non-seasonally adjusted claims filed to the number of employees on states ' non-farm payrolls in February . But the 17.6 percent of workers filing claims there still illustrates a stark increase for a state where the unemployment rate had for years hovered around 3.5 percent or lower . <p> Democrats maintain that the region 's long standing financial difficulties were already being exacerbated by the Trump administration in the three years before the coronavirus struck . They point to tariffs and renewable fuel-standard waivers that impacted corn farmers . Manufacturing , too , has taken big hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory positions , while Michigan was down 5,300 and Wisconsin lost 4,100 jobs . <p> Sen. Tammy Baldwin . Alex Wong/Getty Images <p> In her conversations with constituents , Sen. Tammy Baldwin ( D-Wis. ) says they now recognize Trump 's role in a string of earlier economic setbacks , which have been compounded by the virus . <p> " They are very clear about what those missteps are and , frankly , they are angry , " Baldwin said . <p> Experts warn the data of recent job losses is likely still an undercount , given the widespread issues states have had in processing unemployment claims and the fact that self-employed and other newly eligible workers have faced delays in being able to successfully claim aid . <p> Trump aides and allies are primarily focused on changing the subject from the pandemic and ensuing economic devastation -- highlighting Biden 's vulnerabilities in the region rather than defending the administration 's response . In interviews , they critiqued Biden 's embrace of environmental policies like the Green New Deal and past trade pacts like NAFTA . A Trump campaign aide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " public option " proposal would crowd out private insurance and drive rural hospitals out of business . <p> Republicans on the ground describe an enthusiasm gap that could work to their advantage . <p> " My gut tells me that Democrats are n't engaged on this issue in the same way that a center-right Trump voter has been , " said Dennis Lennox , a Republican strategist in Michigan , of the unrest and mounting demonstrations over stay-at-home orders . " It 's an absolute possibility that this could flare up again . But it also could be like SARS and we never hear about it again . " <p> Conservative opponents of the lockdowns in the region have grown increasingly aggressive . Wisconsin 's Republican-led legislature notched a major victory over Democratic Gov . Tony Evers ' administration Wednesday when the state Supreme Court struck down the governor 's stay-at-home order . Wisconsin was already close to meeting criteria Evers ' office established for its phased reopening . <p> Evers warned in a cable news appearance shortly after the ruling that it " puts our state into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no protections for the people of Wisconsin , " Evers said on CNN . " When you have more people in a small space -- I do n't care if it 's bars , restaurants or your home -- you 're going to be able to spread the virus . " <p> Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer , a Democrat , alerted protesters this week that their recurring demonstrations could backfire on participants and lead to delays in getting businesses running again . On Wednesday , Whitmer pointed to the flare-ups -- and talk of increased outdoor activity by residents -- to urge people to stick to the guidelines . <p> " It would be a travesty if the sacrifice we 've made was in vain , " she told reporters . <p> Pennsylvania Democratic Gov . Tom Wolf last month vetoed a GOP-backed bill to reopen more businesses . He 's issued stern warnings in recent days that county leaders who defy current state orders will lose out on funding . <p> " Even though we are seeing a positive trend in our Covid-19 cases , we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Benjamin Weston , director of medical services for the Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management , who added that the county will continue dealing with the coronavirus and continued outbreaks and surges until a vaccine is , hopefully , available sometime next year . <p> " This is really the beginning of Covid , " he said , " and we have a long road ahead .

Good evening , everyone , and thank you for joining our earnings call . I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during this time of uncertainty . <p> Before we go to Q&amp;A , I want to spend a few minutes on some important points from our stockholder letter . First , we had a strong quarter . Dayforce revenue , excluding float and on a constant currency basis , grew by 31.9% as compared to 25.3% in the same period last year . Cloud recurring services gross margin increased by 2.5% to 72.6% and in Cloud professional services and other , gross margin improved by 10.8% to negative 3.4% . Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 40 basis points year-over-year to 24.8% . <p> Second , Dayforce continues to see strong demand . We have moved to virtual summits and more digital marketing activities , and pipeline has grown . Based on what we 've seen , our virtual marketing methods have expanded our ability to reach potential customers . <p> Third , we are continuing to sell Dayforce in this economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of wins during the third quarter as well as the momentum we continue to see in April . In the first 4 months of 2020 , we had sales across the globe , including in North America , U.K. , Australia , Germany and Mauritius . <p> Fourth , the demand for Dayforce Wallet is meeting our expectations . We launched dayforcewallet.com , and the launch comes at a time when we believe workers need it most . We have a broad spectrum of customers across industries looking to implement Dayforce Wallet to support their work during this unprecedented time . On April 9 , we activated our first customer , Danone . We will provide updates on Dayforce Wallet usage in future quarters , and we continue to expect to have more than 100 organizations live by the end of the year . <p> Finally , we announced an agreement to acquire Excelity . Building on our recent investments in Australia and New Zealand , we believe that this acquisition , which is expected to close in the second quarter , will position Ceridian as a leading HCM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 300 clients , which produces than 1.2 million payslips and operates its major payroll platform in 13 countries , including India , China , Singapore , Hong Kong , Japan , Indonesia , South Korea , Malaysia , the Philippines , Taiwan , Thailand , Australia and New Zealand . This acquisition provides us an opportunity to land and expand in the Asia Pacific region , accelerating market presence and pave the way to extend the Dayforce native payroll platform to the Asia Pacific region . <p> In addition to the Excelity acquisition , we began development of major payroll engines for Germany , Mexico and Mauritius , which are expected to be completed in the next 18 months . <p> I would now like to hand it back to the operator to open the call for questions . <p> Great . Hope everyone is safe and healthy . So on Dayforce specifically , can you just comment a little bit more about sort of the pipeline building efforts ? I know in your shareholder letter , you talked a little bit about what you 're seeing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more and talk about what you and your customers are talking about and how that pipeline building is going ? <p> So thanks for the -- Daniel , thanks for the question . Look , in Q1 , we saw , obviously , very strong Dayforce revenue growth . As mentioned , Dayforce recurring grew by 30.4% on a constant currency ex-float basis . The Dayforce total revenue grew by 31.9% , ex-float and on a constant currency basis . <p> In the first quarter , we continued to see sales towards the end of March . And as mentioned , and as outlined in the stockholder letter , we will continue to see sales in the month of April . We 're seeing sales really across the industry , obviously , a little bit more impacted in the hospitality and the retail area . But other than that , it appears that there is still strong demand for human capital management solutions . <p> Great . And then on the acquisition that you announced today , those are a lot of countries . Beyond sort of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do you see this transition happening ? And then you 've got both the acquisition you made last year and this new acquisition . Can you just frame how we should be thinking about how this could -- the moving pieces over the next year or 2 for all these different countries you 're moving into ? <p> Sure . So Daniel , we 've spoken a lot about this in the past . Our goal is to be in more than 20 countries with native payroll engines within the next few years . And so this acquisition , obviously , is very consistent with that . Excelity positions us as a leading provider in the APJ region almost immediately . It is also consistent with what we 've spoken about from an M&amp;A strategy , which is effectively to seek out players in particular regions , to acquire effectively around 2 to 3x the multiple of revenue and over a period of time , leverage their know-how and their market presence to accelerate the launch of native Dayforce into those particular regions . So on a several year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those regions , obviously , with the full HCM suite capacity . <p> Congratulations . Hope everyone 's safe . With regards to -- it 's obviously early in April , but can you talk a little bit about what you 're seeing in your client base , the existing client base , just in terms of the number of employees that they 're laying off or furloughing , and how , from a temporary perspective , we should think about the impact of that , both in terms of like is there a difference between a furlough versus a layoff ? And how we should think about base subscription fees versus a direct PEPM relationship ? <p> Thanks a lot , Mark . So I 'm going to break it up into Dayforce and into Powerpay separately . Just as a reminder , Powerpay accounts for a little bit less than 10% of total revenue . <p> On the Dayforce side , we get paid for both active and inactive employees . Furloughed employees count as inactive employees . And so we still do receive the recurring revenue on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a lot of detail . We explained that up to April 15 , the employees part of Dayforce systems had increased 17% year-over-year , but it was 5% less than the amount that we had expected at the beginning of the year . When I look at the employee count , and we monitor these obviously on a daily basis , it appears that beyond the Dayforce side and on the Powerpay side , it looks like the layoffs or the furloughing of employees has really flattened out , and we 've seen a little bit of increases over the last week on both of the actual products . So on the Dayforce side , we 're impacted only when employees get terminated , not when they get furloughed . <p> On the Powerpay side , slightly different . We get paid on a per paycheck basis . About 40% of the Powerpay revenue is recurring . The other 60% is early monthly fees that is not dependent on headcount . Up until April 15 , we 've seen a 13% decline in terms of headcount . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts for just less than 10% of the revenue . <p> That 's great . And then with regards to just the wallet , it sounds like that 's going really well . Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of the latest thoughts in terms of how the business model 's going to work from a revenue recognition perspective and what take-up 's going to be like within the clients and what you 've seen internally with your own workforce ? <p> So again , very early days , given that we just took live the first customer , Danone , on April 9 . We spent effectively the first quarter getting ready for launch , and that 's not only the product with all of the marketing , assets and implementation assets as well . We have a backlog of clients that are waiting now to go live with wallet . We waited really until the 1st of April because of some of the quarter end processes we wanted to get through . And then there was a slight delay in getting the apps published on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the application can now be downloaded in the U.S. on both of those . <p> The reaction from our own employees , who 've been using the system , is very , very positive . It 's a very clean experience in terms of activating the wallet . Very similar to the Dayforce app . When you download the Dayforce Wallet , it 's almost like if you have Facebook and you load Instagram , it shares the same type of authentication method and such . So it 's really very easy to use . The -- we do personalization of the actual plastic , which comes and looks really , really sharp . And then we also have the touch-less capability through either the phone or if you have an Apple Watch and such . The reactions have been very , very positive . <p> I hope you guys stayed safe . Can you just -- the one thing that was a focus for you guys in recent quarters was to kind of highlight the strength you have with continuous payroll around the integration or , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some very interesting wins in the U.K. , for example , with the coffee chain , et cetera , like the rural industries that have hourly workers . And so now that the screens that came up , like , what 's your footprint there in terms of your pipeline for the current customers ? Does that kind of create a bigger impact for you compared to other HR players ? Or is it that just like a growth opportunity , and the customers that you guys have is much more broad-based ? Maybe just give us some color on that because that would help us a lot . <p> Yes , yes . It 's for -- if you look at -- yes . Wherever you 're in an installed base . And if you look at the pipeline , like , was that kind of -- because you 've talked a lot about it , but it does n't mean that they all have to be in that space . But a little bit more color there . <p> So mostly , the pipeline obviously has shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical sales . We obviously are spending much more effort now in developing pipeline in what we term surge industries . And we 're still seeing growth in many of those industries . When it comes to the actual historical , Jeremy can correct me , but I believe probably about 14% . Is that correct , Jeremy , of the employee base would be in kind of I 'll call it , retail or hospitality that would be impacted by COVID . We do have a larger footprint in retail , but those would be in groceries and such , some fast food that have n't already been impacted . Even across the retail group , we have n't seen massive layoffs . We 've seen furloughed employees . And as you know , we do get paid for those furloughed employees . <p> Okay , that 's really helpful . Okay , that 's really helpful . And then maybe a follow-up like on float . If you think in like , obviously , the came down . Like can you remind us of how your investment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that might change with the current , kind of rate environment ? <p> Sure . The way we do the float is we effectively break it up between a core portfolio and a liquidity portfolio . In the liquidity portfolio , we basically keep the money in overnight . And in the core portfolio , we obviously use a laddering strategy . So you 're typically , an average life of about 2.5 to 3 years . The -- just the impact of the change in the Fed rate , as you know , has gone down by about 150 basis points , about 25 basis points . On a full year basis , that 's an $18 million headwind for us . We are n't -- obviously , we ca n't do much changes between how we do the investments as the trust funds are AAA-rated . That 's the point system that we have to use investment side . So that effectively determines what percent of your government and what types of corps we 're allowed to invest in . <p> Got it . And then can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape ? Are you seeing anything unusual to call out from competitors , you being more aggressive on price , considering how they do the market , like that ? <p> I hope everybody is doing well . David , maybe first question . Just in the shareholder letter , I saw the comment about rolling in more minimums into the contracts . Could you maybe remind us what the current minimum threshold is on average for the customer base and how that currently works ? And then I have one follow-up . <p> Sure . One -- in current contracts , there is no minimum . We charge on the number of active and inactive employees , typically on the 15th of the month . And we charge 1 month in advance . So we are making some changes to contracting going forward , to provide a minimum , which is obviously a percentage of the employees at time of contracting . <p> Great . Very helpful . And then maybe just on the Bureau business . I know there are plans to maybe accelerate some of the -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with a lot of challenges right now . I 'm curious if you 're seeing customers accelerate the shift off of Bureau and maybe increasingly going to Dayforce ? Or what are your plans on the Bureau side ? And how is that benefiting or impacting Dayforce ? <p> Again , the strategy on Bureau has n't changed . As you know , we aggressively are now trying to end of life the Bureau products with the exception of the tax . Tax is probably about a $50 million business of the remaining Bureau . Every quarter , we move around about $5 million from Bureau to Dayforce , and then there 's probably an equal amount that just goes away as we do n't really have a home for it in the Dayforce type of world . There has n't been any change to each of the pace of approaching customers or the pace of us end of lifing . But as we mentioned prior , by the end of the year , we already expect the aggregate business to be -- and Jeremy can kind of provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Josh on for Scott . Do you anticipate any impact to your partner strategy upmarket from COVID-19 given that was just getting launched for new business in 2021 ? Or do these relationships remain on track ? <p> If anything , there 's an opportunity to lean in and strengthen these types of relationships . So in one way , it allows us to basically , in professional services , rely much more on taxing through the use of a larger size as opposed to hiring directly professional services people . <p> Okay , great . And then just a follow-up . Do you expect any delayed impact to business trends in Canada , given that they implemented social distancing after the United States , which has implications for their curve of infection rate ? <p> I honestly do n't see much of a difference between the U.S. and Canada . I 'm not sure who actually did social distancing first . I ca n't remember it . As an organization , we probably did a few weeks ahead of both the U.S. and Canada . What I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From a sales perspective , from a marketing perspective , implementation , customer support , all of that , even in times of non-COVID , is usually done on a non-touch basis . So it does n't really make much of a difference . <p> As I mentioned beforehand , we monitor the employee headcount at all of our customers . And when I look at both Canada and the U.S. , we 've seen a slight increase in employees and customers over the last week . So nothing really to get overly excited about , but there seems to be evidence that the impact of COVID has kind of bottomed out . <p> Hope you 're all doing well . I wanted to ask on implementations . Can you give us a sense of the mix of customers that might be delaying implementations here ? And then any difference in the behavior of the clients that have already started implementations as far as pauses or whether most are still moving forward ? <p> Look , it 's a mix . If I look at the impact of implementations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period that we typically would take live all of the customers from Q1 . The overall impact of COVID in Q1 was probably about $1 million to $2 million in terms of the amount of recurring revenue we would have activated in that particular quarter . So there was some impact , but it definitely was n't a material amount . We did also see some of the kickoffs of new projects get pushed a little bit , but we 're confident that they 'll get restarted relatively soon if they have n't been restarted already . <p> In terms of the impact from the industry , obviously , it 's probably in line with what you would expect . It was a specialty retail -- retailer , it probably was more impacted than , say , if it was an extended care living facility . <p> Okay . And then as far as the demand environment , can you comment on just buying behavior you might be seeing between -- for Dayforce , between major markets and enterprise customers ? And any modules or functionalities within the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? <p> Yes , yes . So let me just add another step that I actually mentioned before . 88% of Dayforce employees are at customers above 500 employees . The vast majority of Dayforce accounts really would be in major markets or in enterprise . I have n't really seen a material difference between behaviors between major markets and enterprise . Now that may be because we have moved upmarket quite significantly over the last year . And you see that in some of the numbers we spoke about in the stockholder letter . For instance , the incremental revenue per Dayforce account increased 63% to $213,196 from $130,998 a year before . So most of our -- obviously , a larger proportion of our customers will be towards the upper end of major markets in the enterprise side . <p> This is Matt Coss on behalf of Mark Murphy . David , you said that furloughing of employees seems to have stabilized , and some have even come back . What is your sense for how many furloughed employees might eventually come back -- or excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on conversations with your customers ? <p> Look , hey Mark ( sic ) Matt , and nice to hear from you . I do n't have the answer to that . In terms of furloughed employees , again , we get paid for furloughed employees . What I can say is when I look at furloughed employees versus active employees at our customer base , the percentage of furloughed employees seems to be going down . So there seems to be a movement in our customer base in activating inactive employees . In terms of employees that they have let go , I do n't know what -- if they will come back to the levels they had previously , but I think we 'll probably get a bit more clarity over the next 6 months or so . <p> Okay . And you also mentioned the sales cycle had extended in some cases . And are those cases mostly in the heavily impacted industry ? And if the sales cycle are extending , are they sort of -- are some of these deals off the table ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your sense for how many will ultimately return to you ? <p> Sure . So there 's a few questions in there . First , we 've seen very few projects get canceled . The pattern seems to be that there 's a push into later quarters . In terms of industry , I do n't know if that was the primary reason for pushes . I believe that in the end of March , it was effectively everyone 's getting ready to work from home and some organizations like us has the maturity and has policy to make it very easy , others did n't . And so the same people that would have made decisions on systems like ours were quite busy in helping their employees get productive and get up to speed from working from home . At the moment , I think there 's kind of a return to work effort that 's going on in a lot of the clients . And that also created a little bit of distraction . But I think we 're actually feeling positive that we 'll go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the , kind of the volume and the momentum of sales that we saw , even in the first month of this quarter . <p> I was just wondering whether customers have been requesting any new functionality or solution sets in the current environments and whether you 're seeing any interest in add-on sales as customer needs change . <p> Great question . So we were quite proactive in this . So very early on in COVID , we made some enhancements to the Dayforce product . The first was we added a COVID tracker , which effectively allows employees to register which offices they 've been to . And then if there is a suspected case of COVID or positive case of COVID , our system can generate a list of people who may have come into contact with the person . And we also enhanced the messaging engine to make it easy to be broadcast via SMS or personal e-mail , so that people could get notified in a very efficient manner . <p> The second thing we did is that we loaded into learning management system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you work from home ? How do you manage employees at home ? How do you stay safe ? How do you wash your hands ? And other pieces of really important information . And we added that to all Dayforce instances whether people had the learning management system or not . And we also launched or we activated a public version of Dayforce Learning . That 's available for any organization to use . They can just simply go on , register , load their employees and such , and that provides all the COVID pieces . In the near term , you 'll see us launch a lot of kind of features and communications about return to work and about helping companies prepare to get people back into the offices and as such . <p> In terms of add-on sales , as you know , add-on sales has always been 20% of what we sell . Obviously , there is a strong demand for learning management . There 's obviously -- the other pieces of the application do apply quite nicely in this environment . <p> Great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlook . So congrats on the Excelity acquisition . Just wondering if you 've seen -- what you 're seeing in the M&amp;A market right now , if you 've seen any impact of valuations or the number of prospects that are out there . <p> We 're quite laser-focused when we try to do these things . We have started to work on Excelity in 2019 . And yes , COVID obviously did have some impact to timing , but I ca n't say that I 've actually seen any real change in M&amp;A activity in the marketplace . <p> This is Yao Chew on for Brad Zelnick . I hope everyone is staying safe . Just wanted to dive a bit more into the go-to-market strategy and sort of a 2-part question within this . I was glad that you -- seeing how you managed to adapt to the virtual go-to-market motion with the seminars and summit , but there 's always a lot of steps between the top of funnel , between website traffic and qualified leads and final implementation . It 's new to everyone involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottlenecks are , if there are any major ones to call out , and how receptive customers are to this approach ? And on that , does this change any longer-term views on traditional go-to-market given the new resources and ROI or effectiveness that you may be seeing here ? <p> Yes . Look , as you can probably gather from the stockholder letter or even from today 's talk , we 've been chosen to lean in into the current environment to strengthen our organization . And in terms of marketing , we moved very quickly to more of a digital marketing focus . And we started off with our first virtual summit , which effectively had about 2 , 3x the attendance that we typically would see on physical . And the reactions we got from it was very positive . And so from that , we obviously extended that . We did one in Australia . We did one in the U.K. We did another one in North America last week . I believe we have one coming up in the U.K. and Ireland in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up with a format that 's very engaging . This one involves customer speakers . We did a very thorough demonstration of the actual product . We answered questions live . We still do now virtual one-on-ones with prospective customers and such , and it seems to be going very nicely . <p> The second part about the digital marketing is that because we really are experts when it comes to payroll and tax . And as you know , with the various government programs in the U.S. and Canada , there 's been a lot of complexity that the customers have had to have understood . And we 've done a lot of very informative webinars , leveraging outside speakers and our own experts , and I think that has improved the brand of Ceridian . In other words , reinforcing how important it is to be experts and be able to do the compliance calculations correctly and have the internal compliance teams that really can help customers adjust as they need to , to remain compliant and to help their employees . Lastly , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . We 're now living in a world where people really would like to do touchless transactions . They really do need to be able to get their earned wages as quickly as possible . And having a mechanism that allows organizations to really get money into the hands of their employees when they need them is obviously a great feature . <p> I had 2 questions . The first is , when you mentioned the competitive landscape , I wanted to ask about pricing in really , in 2 dimensions . Are you seeing any changes in price discovery when there 's new work to be done and/or new bids out there , I meant , and/or are you seeing any customers coming back and asking for price relief , particularly in the most affected industries ? So are you seeing any broad primers or any kind of changes in pricing ? <p> So I do n't think we 've seen any changes in pricing . And as we 've mentioned , we 're making some changes to future contracts in terms of adding minimums to the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that we get paid for furloughed employees really has provided us with a lot of insulation from COVID . So we are quite fortunate in that regard . <p> In terms of the customers in impacted industries , we 've been quite proactive . We look at our customers as very long-term partnerships , and we want to be able to support them in any way that we obviously can . So in serving industries , we did do a reach out to help them more from a financing perspective during this particular period . That 's not really on a rate reduction basis . <p> Okay . So maybe financing helped , okay . The second is on wallet . You did previously comment that you 've had a backlog build in the very short period of time . I was just wondering if you could revisit on what you think the metrics might be for the maturing of wallet , when we might see some revenues ? Previously you talked about next fiscal year , you were going to see kind of the first wallet revenues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the potential of wallet ? And could there indeed be some revenues as we get towards the end of this fiscal year ? <p> Well , we 're doing the rollout obviously of stuff now . And as much of this stuff is obviously , are going to be activated in the second half of the year , I think that will be a fair statement . I do n't think that we 'll see a material impact from revenue in 2020 . As we get more experience with the product , as we mentioned inside the stockholder letter , we will share that with everyone , so people can start to model . And we 'll start to talk more about the business as we have for information about it .

@@31861241 <h> The Woman Tasked With Saving the Subway Is Still Commuting on It <h> Sarah Feinberg took over the city 's transit in a state of emergency -- and controversy . <p> New York City Transit interim president Sarah Feinberg , 42 , turns her camera for a moment to show me how deserted the 30th floor of 2 Broadway is . " It 's myself , the guy who sits at the front and lets people through the locked door , " she narrates as she pans MTA headquarters . " A woman who basically runs the office is here some days . And then our NYPD liaison is here most days . And that 's it . " The NYCTA , whose very density has been blamed for New York City being the epicenter of the coronavirus , is being run from a ghost town . <p> She swivels back to her own nondescript workspace : beige shades , a monitor behind her head , cherry-veneer cabinetry . Feinberg started in the office March 2 -- five days before Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York -- so there has n't been much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up around 5 a.m. in the East Village apartment she shares with her partner , journalist and former Vice News executive Josh Tyrangiel , and works until their 2-year-old daughter wakes up . ( Their nanny has been staying home ; Tyrangiel is for now the primary caregiver . ) Then she either walks or takes the 4 or 5 to the office on a system where ridership plummeted by more than 90 percent and tries to figure out how to dig New York City 's transit out of a disaster worse than anything anyone has seen before . As of this writing , at least 123 transit workers have died of COVID-19 ; facing financial ruin , the state-run MTA is panhandling in Washington for its survival ; anyone who has a choice is avoiding public transportation , and Feinberg is managing the fallout from an unprecedented overnight closure and cleaning of the trains . There 's a saying in transit that you 're only as good as your last rush hour . But what does that mean when the very prospect of peak crowding is terrifying ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever met right now , " says Lisa Daglian , the executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA . Does she think Feinberg wants the job permanently ? " Oh God , would you ? Personally , I do n't know if I would want the job on a good day . " <p> Feinberg , who ran the Federal Railroad Administration under President Obama and served on Amtrak 's board , actually said " No " a year ago when Cuomo offered her the MTA chairmanship , a rung above her current gig . She 'd had a baby and , Feinberg says now , " I could n't imagine taking a 24/7 job when she was 1 . " Feinberg agreed to be on the MTA board instead , where she made headlines advocating for an expanded transit police force and , less controversially ( and less effectively ) , station accessibility . <p> Then Andy Byford , nicknamed " Train Daddy " and adored as incorruptible by the press , transit workers , and advocates , resigned and was regaled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week Feinberg started , " had become somewhat intolerable " as he was undercut from above -- meaning by the governor . ( Byford declined to be interviewed . ) On February 23 , Feinberg agreed to step in on a temporary basis . <p> " This is a story about Andrew Cuomo , because every story about the MTA is about Andrew Cuomo , " says the Riders ' Alliance 's Danny Pearlstein . " Andy Byford is not here because of Andrew Cuomo , and Sarah Feinberg is here because of Andrew Cuomo . " <p> Feinberg says of the governor : " I 've sat through just countless , countless hours of meetings with him , where I just find that we land on how to address big , deep , complicated knots of problems in a similar way . " And yet even Cuomo critics like Benjamin Kabak , who blogs at Second Avenue Sagas , would n't say Feinberg is simply the governor 's yes-woman . As a board member , Feinberg " was n't just parroting what he had to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gaps between Andy Byford and Andrew Cuomo . " Daglian calls Feinberg " no nonsense . She is forceful . She is strong . " <p> The cautiously warm reception is a testament to Feinberg 's people skills and work ethic , especially considering she only moved to New York in 2017 . Or maybe , in a stepchild agency dominated by stagnating feuds between city and state leadership , it actually helps : " She 's not immersed in the past of the MTA and all the prior dysfunction , " said Linda Lacewell , a fellow Cuomo appointee to the MTA board . <p> The daughter of a legislator and a federal judge in West Virginia ( Joe Manchin introduced her at her Senate confirmation hearing and reminisced about meeting her as a five or six -year-old ) , Feinberg clocked more years in D.C. Democratic politics than in transportation . She spent nearly seven years at the side of Rahm Emanuel , whom she followed from the House to the White House , where she was the senior advisor to Emanuel , who was Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Emanuel told me . " She 's willing to walk into an office and tell you when you 're wrong . " <p> In 2010 , Feinberg 's marriage to then-Obama official and current Pod Save America host Dan Pfeiffer ended . She left the White House for blue-chip communications jobs at Bloomberg LP and later Facebook , but told the White House she intended to come back to public service . " I actually just called the White House and said , ' I 'm ready to come back , ' " she says . They floated chief of staff at the Department of Transportation or the deputy chief of staff at the Pentagon ; Feinberg said she 'd be open to either . " I 'd love to say it 's this long , simmering fascination with locomotives , but it was n't , " she says . <p> When she eventually took over the railroad regulatory agency , it was a sort of a dress rehearsal for managing through this crisis -- major derailments , track fires . Spending the first , pivotal 18 months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was inculcated by Emanuel 's maxim , which she repeats to me : " I 'm a big believer that every crisis presents significant opportunities . Never let a crisis go to waste . " <p> The question is , an opportunity for what ? Not unlike her boss in those early Obama years , Feinberg faces chafing on the left . It started with her stint on the board championing Cuomo 's crackdown on fare evasion ( and , she would add , sexual assault on the trains ) and to add 500 more cops to the subway . " The policing issue has been a good introduction to the press corps in New York for me , " she says wryly . " I 've tried to be really clear in how I talk about it and why I think it 's important , and I 'm not sure I 've ever been comfortable with the way I then read it . " She says it was important to have a police force whose priorities the MTA could enforce . When I ask about a video of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground in front of her child for not wearing a mask , she says , " Now , if the police are reporting to me , am I going to suggest anyone be arrested for not wearing a mask ? No , of course not . " ( Mayor de Blasio has since said no one else will be arrested or ticketed for not wearing a mask . ) <p> Only weeks ago , MTA workers were n't even allowed to wear their own masks , following CDC guidance that mask wearing was ineffective . ( Tramell Thompson , a subway conductor with a YouTube channel called Progressive Action , titled an April episode referring to MTA chairman Pat Foye " The Inaction of Foye &amp; Feinberg Has Lead to 47 Dead MTA Employees . " It featured a prerecorded condolence message turned pep talk from none other than Andy Byford . ) I ask Feinberg , who calls herself " a believer in government , " if she has any regrets . She says , " I deeply regret that the federal government failed on that , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she started , as positive cases and exposures mounted , Feinberg had to decide which workers to quarantine and where to reduce service . She ended up having to self-quarantine when a slew of top managers -- her boss Foye , the agency 's chief safety and security officer , and the deputy chief of the MTA police -- tested positive . And as executives worked from home , workers on the ground were sidelined -- at one point , the entire 2 line was out because its crew had been exposed to a single person who had done fitness-for-duty checks on all of them . Absences inevitably led to service cuts which led to crowding . <p> " I felt like anyone can take a photo of one car and post it on Twitter , and that 's my New York Post and New York Daily News story that day , right ? " says Feinberg . " It may literally be the only rail car on the entire train that 's crowded ... but that 's driving my day . Which is frustrating to me . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went further . " Our organizations are alarmed that crowding on particular MTA bus and train routes poses an imminent public-health threat to New Yorkers , especially black and brown communities where the city 's essential workforce is concentrated , " read their open letter . <p> Feinberg was furious and took what the advocates said was a systemic claim as a personal charge of racism . " I am personally , deeply offended by the suggestion that I , or anyone working for me or with me , would in any way discriminate , " she wrote in an emailed response that I saw , which she asked to be shared with all of the groups . " You do not know me well yet , and you certainly do not know me well enough to suggest that I would allow this to happen on my watch . I hope in time you will know me well enough to know that any form of discrimination is anathema to who I am and everything about me . " <p> She 's stillfurious when I ask her about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalling . To have someone in the middle of a crisis write us a letter saying , ' No. 1 , you 're not doing a good enough job in the middle of a devastating crisis . And No. 2 , we think the reason you 're not doing a good enough job is not because this is a massive global pandemic and not because our federal government has failed and not because there 's a whole issue with who are essential workers ... but because we think you do n't care about certain people as much . ' Clearly I 'm not over it . I 'm not getting over that one . " <p> She maintains New York City Transit did n't need to be told to redistribute service to essential workers . " There 's a whole advocacy world that makes a living off of weighing in on how we 're doing our job , " she says . " And they fundamentally do n't understand how we do our job . They fundamentally do n't understand that everyone who works here wakes up and tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Dailey , director of advocacy and organizing at the TransitCenter and one of the organizers of the letter , responded , " Calling on the MTA to think more comprehensively about mobility and racial equity is not a personal attack on any individual or previous efforts , it 's a straightforward recognition that what we have all been doing is broken and needs to be fixed . " ) <p> Conversely , Feinberg is rankled that the head of the New York City Stock Exchange said that employees could come back as long as they do n't take public transportation . " Did you see that ? " she says heatedly . " They did n't say , ' You 're not allowed to come to work if you go to an unauthorized party in Greenwich . " <p> The problem for the MTA is that it 's not just stockbrokers who are loath to board a train . In a poll by the research company Elucd , 44 percent of New Yorkers said they plan to avoid public transportation even after lockdown is lifted . The most visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. for cleaning , even though the CDC is now deemphasizing the risks of surface transmission . Feinberg freely concedes that closing is also about psychological reassurance for potential riders . " People need to know that we 're cleaning , but they need to see that we 're cleaning , " says Feinberg . ( Conveniently , the closures , which advocates like Kabak worry will kill 24-hour service forever , also provided the MTA a lever to eject the homeless population from the train . ) The MTA is also experimenting with using UV lights for cleaning . <p> Most epidemiologists agree that sustained contact in closed spaces is prime spreading territory , but decrowding the trains is a lot harder than hiring contractors to spray down cars . Feinberg has been encouraging " the business community " to continue telework or stagger the days of the week employees are expected to be in the office and , barring that , to be more flexible with latecomers whose commute is disrupted because they 're avoiding crowds . <p> Pat Foye also floated the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I first heard it , I could n't figure out how it was going to work , but the longer I 've spent thinking about it , the more I think it has real promise , " says Feinberg diplomatically . For example , rather than reserving a particular train departure , she says , riders could reserve time ranges that would help the system make decisions about capacity . Or , she says , there could be an app telling you which cars in a given train are at capacity . <p> Though a few Upper East Side stations now have markers on the platform floors to indicate social distancing , Feinberg is pretty blunt in calling the six-feet-apart standard unattainable . " It 's not possible in New York City , " she says . A ridership drop of 90 percent , she points out , still meant 400,000 riders a day , and in recent weeks it 's started to slowly tick up When a routine disruption , like a rail defect , delays the next train , " you have a crowding issue like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis may be Feinberg 's strongest asset . " The most important piece of this job at this moment is to be extremely straightforward and candid with New York about what the system is right now , what it can be , and what their expectations should be . " She is similarly uncoy when asked about whether she 'll stay in the job longer than whatever " interim " means . <p> " I do n't find the job workable with the way that I want to be a mom and a partner on a permanent basis , " she says . " This is the best job in transportation . It is interesting . It 's exciting . It 's fascinating . It is super-challenging . It will push you harder than you 've ever been pushed and make you grow in ways that you never thought you would grow , right ? And that is the kind of job I yearn for and want desperately .

' " <p> " The National Party focus on creating the conditions for people to be employed and people to move into full employment and to maximise the potential which is sort of my philosophy that , you know your potential and can realise that over the course of your life , that is where we 're going to put our focus . " <p> Muller says he will be keeping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the best performers able to elevate themselves into a spot in Cabinet should National win the election . <p> But what would Muller , who spoke of his childhood as " the only Pakeha boy in a Maori convent " , do to help Maori and Pasifika communities ? <p> The answer is light on specifics and strong on conservative tropes , as has been the case for many policy issues ( perhaps to be expected given he is still in his first week as leader ) . <p> " Because they are communities that are often most represented in the challenging statistics of this country , they 're the communities that will feel the impact of Covid-19 in an economic context , disproportionately , so it 's the same question around how then , what is the best mix of economic policy and social policy to be able to affect genuine change for those communities ? <p> " And I 've always felt that the National Party focus on creating the conditions for people to be employed and people to move into full employment and to maximise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know your potential and can realise that over the course of your life , that is where we 're going to put our focus .

First , as to their fear and unhappiness , I would point out : <p> It would n't take a big leap of faith to believe that many US voters and consumers have a less favorable view now than they did before the Coronavirus of China in general , manufacturing in China , and US companies that do manufacturing in China .

If this happens , the result may be increased tariffs on your goods made in China , outright bans , or the US government in countless ways favoring companies and products manufactured in places other than China . <p> It is not that easy to predict what China will do as things change . After all , China has gone through enormous changes in the last few decades and is very likely to experience even more in the next few years .

Then , I would wink . <p> Very few , if any , of the risks of you doing business with China outlined above are likely to happen regarding you doing business with Mexico . For example , Mexico is very unlikely to build artificial islands to claim part of the Gulf of Mexico and make them into military bases or have geo-political ambitions to challenge the US or to dominate US trade shipping routes . <p> Mexico is geographically closer than China , so shipping costs should be much lower .

" <p> Of course , the Founding Father has many quotes that remain relevant today . But the one about preparation seems particularly prescient during the coronavirus pandemic . Examples of preparation -- and a lack of it -- are evident throughout the country as the nation struggles with an outbreak that has contributed to about 100,000 deaths . <p> Among the examples of strong preparation is a fascinating exercise undertaken by Clark County Public Health . Four years ago , the department 's Ethics Committee created a ventilator allocation plan in the event of a crisis that would stretch local capacity . <p> A 2017 project summary states : " The surge of patients requiring intensive care during an influenza pandemic could overwhelm the medical care capacity of many communities , including ours . During a pandemic , shortages of ventilators and other medical equipment could place physicians and other health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their patients . " <p> That was part of a plan that is now in the last stage of being finalized . And it appears farsighted in the midst of the pandemic . <p> Fortunately , Clark County has not been overwhelmed by a need for ventilators . Statewide stay-at-home orders have been credited with preventing hospitals from being overrun by COVID-19 patients , even as the disease has contributed to more than 1,000 deaths in Washington . But the serendipitous exercise of preparing for a pandemic has represented the ounce of prevention that can outweigh a pound of cure . <p> In the event of more patients that ventilators , a triage team of a critical care doctor or hospitalist , a critical care nurse and an ethicist would determine who has access to a ventilator .

At the federal level , that is reflected in the Trump administration 's failure to plan for and react quickly to the outbreak . <p> In 2016 , the Obama administration finalized a detailed 69-page plan for reacting to a pandemic . Critics have asserted that the Trump administration ignored that playbook ; White House officials have said they replaced it with two new response plans . <p> Even if the administration had a robust plan , it is clear it has not been followed . The Obama playbook , which is publicly available , calls for coordinated messaging from the White House , rather than the mixed messages that have been evident . It also stresses a timeline for ensuring there are adequate supplies of personal protection equipment and for working with Congress to direct necessary funding ; President Trump was months behind both benchmarks while insisting the virus " miraculously goes away .

So as we come out of the pandemic , will we continue to produce our own sanitisers , PPEs among others ? If we do not have a long-term strategy , we will go back to our bad habits . <p> Those countries that are proactive in their strategies will take over once again and we will continue to follow . <p> *9The good thing is that we have discovered our sense of creativity once again . <p> This is the time to soberly reflect and redefine the content of our " import basket " . <p> Let us look deeper into the import basket and begin to define which items should be removed from it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " export basket " and consider filling them with not only primary products but value-added products . <p> This requires practical policy direction from the government . <h> The way forward <p> There is a need for targeted investment in research and development . Research and development are not things we take seriously in our public discourse . Perhaps this is because we focus too much on short-term gains . <p> As a nation we do not allocate enough resources to research and development . <p> We like to be certain about results before we proceed to invest . <p> But that is anti-innovation . As a country , what is our budget for research and development ? <p> There are no shortcuts ! The less interest in funding research activities is seen at the micro and macro levels . <p> The countries we depend on to get medical and other supplies have invested and continue to invest in research and development to get " the next big thing " to commercialise . <p> In the many industrialised countries that are constantly innovating ; research is prioritised and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Ghana , where there is investment in research , it is for short-term results .

They were getting free pads every month from their school . But now since all schools are closed , they are facing inaccessibility of sanitary pads . The government is not providing sanitary pads along with foodgrains or under some other schemes . These girls are completely cut off from the supply for over two months . In Delhi alone , approximately 15,000 have directly impacted due to COVID-19 lockdown in terms of the menstrual hygiene management . <p> Mr. Bagaria further said that the small manufacturing units which were producing low-cost sanitary napkins have been shut due to lockdown and the workers have moved back to their homes .

@@31867141 <h> More than a quarter of Spokane County child care centers are temporarily closed -- and many are wondering how they 'll reopen <p> The news that a toddler who had been cared for at a Spokane child care center tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this month made at least one other center director feel sick to her stomach -- and it worried many more . <p> " We 're all living in this world where this virus exists and it 's not going away , " Monica Bertucci , executive director of Blueprints for Learning , told The Spokesman-Review . " We will be dealing with it . And we just have do the best we can . " <p> So far , the state health department has recorded four COVID-19 outbreaks in Washington related to child care facilities . But that may be an underestimate due to a lack of testing and contact tracing . <p> The case in Spokane at Just Imagine Child Care Center was linked to one other positive test , according to the Spokane Regional Health District . Health officials will not say whether that person is a family member but pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The state Department of Children , Youth and Families began doling out grant funding about two weeks ago to thousands of child care providers that have remained open statewide , including about 155 Spokane providers who received about $1.3 million in total . <p> But the one-time grants -- ranging from $6,500 to $14,000 per provider , depending on the size of their operation -- is likely a drop in the bucket for most . <p> Many of the providers who have stayed open through the pandemic have faced declining enrollment , often meaning fewer dollars contributing to overhead costs . <p> Meanwhile , the child care providers that already closed ca n't apply for state grant funding . In Spokane , that was about 27% of providers , or nearly 80 businesses , as of Wednesday , according to DCYF . <p> About 22% of child care providers statewide , or about 1,200 businesses , were closed on Wednesday . <p> Out of 2,500 Washington child care providers who responded to a recent survey , approximately 41% said they were at risk of permanent closure , mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Child Care Aware of Washington . <p> The same survey also found just 49 of those respondents received federal economic disaster loans and 202 received federal Paycheck Protection Program loans . <p> Obtaining personal protective equipment , such as masks and gloves , in addition to regular cleaning supplies and hand sanitizers , has become a struggle , and providers do not have access to the state 's stock of supplies . <p> As more people head back to work , experts are concerned there may not be enough child care to go around . Many providers were already at or near capacity for child care before the wave of pandemic closures . <p> And the potential for a COVID-19 outbreak in a child care facility , along with the subsequent tracing of virus exposures , poses another potential challenge . <p> " Before this even started we had a crisis with child care , " said Lee Williams , executive director of Community-Minded Enterprises , which runs the nonprofit Child Care Aware of Eastern Washington . " It was not a stable business plan . ( Providers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising expenses . " <p> " A lot of them that have closed ( during the pandemic ) , it just was n't worthwhile for them to stay open , " Williams said . <h> Closing down <p> Until about two weeks ago , Blueprints for Learning , which runs the Community Building Children 's Center downtown , was counted among Spokane 's temporary closures . <p> An average day at that point was one toddler and a few preschoolers in attendance , compared to the center 's regular capacity for nine toddlers and 20 preschoolers . <p> A week later , as concerns about community transmission grew and daily attendance became too difficult to anticipate , the center closed . Then came Gov . Jay Inslee 's " Stay Home , Stay Healthy " order . <p> Still , the closure was only supposed to last through mid-April , Bertucci said . <p> During the closure , Blueprints for Learning reduced tuition by 50% , which families understood was an investment in keeping the center open , according to Bertucci . Staff also continued to hold daily music classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furlough its staff and reduce hours , Bertucci said . Payroll Protection Program loan funds arrived at the beginning of May . <p> Bertucci said increased testing , contact tracing and widespread masking measures helped the center feel confident about reopening earlier this month , as well as knowing there also was a smaller chance of having a case in a child . <p> " We still do n't know everything now , but we know quite a bit more than we did several weeks ago , " Bertucci said . <p> Attendance climbed back toward regular levels upon reopening , with the toddler room at half capacity and the preschool about 85% full with regular students and school-aged siblings . Some families who are n't attending still pay tuition to hold their child 's spot in the program . <p> Bertucci said the center adopted an electronic attendance system for parents to use curbside via cellphones , installed touchless faucets and soap dispensers , and rearranged classrooms for smaller group sizes . All staff members are wearing masks . <p> Before reopening , Bertucci said staff spent two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , receive one-on-one tours through the rearranged facility and share how their children had been coping at home during the pandemic . <p> " That 's a big transition to be back together , " Bertucci said . " It really provided time to have those conversations and address everybody 's concerns . " <p> Children are spending more time outside to limit the time they are in close quarters with one another , Bertucci said . Staff have also taken cleaning " up another notch . " <p> " And we are trusting our community of families to keep their bubbles ( of contact ) really small because they just connected their bubbles to a lot more families , " Bertucci said . <p> " It 's uncomfortable , but it comes down to doing the best we can , " she added later . <p> As a small center , Blueprints for Learning qualifies for $6,500 in state grant funding , which Bertucci said could be used to offer financial relief to families and staff . In case of further economic challenges , the funds could be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is still an active pandemic , " Bertucci said about ongoing financial uncertainties . <h> Staying open <p> Parkview Early Learning Center in north Spokane , which is run by Luc Jasmin III , never closed its doors during the pandemic . <p> But that does n't mean it has n't faced many challenges of its own . <p> Parkview 's normal capacity is about 115 kids , but lately closer to a quarter of them have shown up to the center , according to Jasmin . <p> And unlike Blueprints for Learning , Parkview largely serves families who use government subsidies for child care . So when those children do n't attend , that revenue is lost . <p> Funds from the state 's grant program will cover about 15% of the center 's payroll for a month , which runs about $100,000 , according to Jasmin . <p> The center closes 30 minutes early each day for extra cleaning and all rooms in the facility are operating at half capacity , Jasmin said . The majority of the center 's employees has remained on the payroll by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Staff recently began delivering meals to families , which garners additional government subsidy funding for the center , according to Jasmin . <p> But the facility has been unable to provide all staff with reusable masks and scrubs as hoped , Jasmin said . That leaves teachers without protection from kids who are beginning to act more aggressively , and sometimes physically , toward teachers due to the added pressures of the pandemic . <p> " These kids are feeling it . The behaviors are escalating , " Jasmin said . " We are serving kids that were dealing with a lot already . " <p> The news of a COVID-19 case in a Spokane child care center worried staff and families at Parkview , as well as underscored the importance of protecting the child care work force . He laughed at the thought of asking young children to adhere to strict social distancing . <p> " This is the reality , " Jasmin said . " Unfortunately they were the one , but any of us could have been in that situation . " <p> The state health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documented and easily shared with public health agencies in light of a confirmed case , according to Jessica Baggett , a state health department public information officer . <p> But the Spokane Regional Health District still sees the potential challenges in contact tracing at child care providers , as well as schools . <p> " If it 's limited to a classroom , then generally a whole center wo n't be affected , " Anna Halloran , a SRHD epidemiologist told reporters during a May 13 news conference . " But if there 's any kind of mixing or exchange between staff , it becomes more tricky . " <h> Going back to work <p> As of last Friday , Spokane County had at least 1,250 child care vacancies , according to Child Care Aware of Washington . That number was nearly 23,000 for the entire state . <p> But with more people returning to their workplaces and fewer providers open to take in their kids , experts worry about the looming lack of child care . Many Spokane providers had months-long waiting lists before the pandemic . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think about those child cares that are closed down ? " Jasmin said . <p> " It 's a dilemma as we 're heading into Phase 2 , " said Williams , the Child Care Aware of Eastern Washington director . <p> Nicole Rose , director of eligibility and provider supports for DCYF , said the state is supporting providers by informing them of health guidelines and pointing them toward resources , such as county emergency management departments for protective equipment . <p> The state also readjusted state subsidies to increase the amount of money going directly to providers , Rose said . And more providers have continued to apply for grant funding . <p> Health and education officials are meeting multiple times a month to discuss K-12 education and early learning as the economy reopens , according to Rose . <p> " We need to understand in the new normal what supply and demand looks like , " Rose said . <p> Part of that is learning what families need to feel safe sending their kids to child care and determining what providers need to feel comfortable accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , said the child care business model may change if more people work from home permanently . Regardless , she said , child care employees need higher wages for the work they do and education required of them . <p> Williams said Child Care Aware of Eastern Washington is examining different business models for child care , such as a system for employers to contribute to child care or provide a space for child care at the workplace . <p> Recent modeling suggests costs will increase to provide child care at a center or in a home with social distancing guidelines , according to Rose . <p> " It just highlights , how do we -- as we rebuild the system -- bring it back better ?

" Arizona has had similar players , like Derrick Williams for example , who coach Sean Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Azuolas said UA associate head coach Jack Murphy has developed a good relationship with him since the Basketball Without Borders camp in Chicago last February , in which Azuolas was named to the all-star team . He played with Mathurin in that event . <p> Azuolas played last season for his hometown 's junior club , Rytas Vilnius , and starred for his country in the FIBA U18 European Championships last summer in Greece , where he averaged 14.9 points , 12.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists . In a quarterfinal game against Greece , Tubelis had 23 points , 20 rebounds and seven blocked shots . <p> Azuolas Tubelis , a 6-9 forward from Lithuania , will join The Wildcats for the 2020-21 season . <p> Courtesy FIBA <p> " I think he 's probably the most college-ready of the international players that Arizona has signed , " said 247 analyst Josh Gershon , who said he 's watched Azuolas play at four different events . " He 's about 6-9 and mobile , athletic , tough . He 's also a skilled post and plays really hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket . He has a strong frame , not afraid to compete . <p> " He can also step out and shoot a little bit , and has pretty good balls skills for his position . " <p> While Azuolas Tubelis is probably most suited to power forward he can also play center . The Wildcats now have five players for their two post spots , also including Koloko , senior Ira Lee , sophomore Jordan Brown and French freshman Daniel Batcho . <p> Coincidentally -- though not surprisingly -- both Azuolas Tubelis and Batcho were named MVPs of separate Adidas Next Generation events last season in Europe . Tubelis won his honor in Kaunas , Lithuania while Batcho did so in Belgrade , Serbia . <p> Then , when Tubelis played in the Basketball Without Borders event in Chicago , ESPN draft analyst Jonathan Givony wrote that ESPN identified him as " one of the top NBA prospects in attendance thanks to his athleticism , ability to create offense. pushing the ball off the defensive glass , and energetic style of play . <p> Here are the latest updates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Givony also wrote that " his strength and versatility should allow him to play either frontcourt position for the Wildcats , " but Azuolas Tubelis told ESPN that he is n't expecting any particular role at this point . <p> Tautvilas Tubelis , left , a 6-6 forward from Lithuania , is considered a developing prospect . <p> Courtesy FIBA <p> " I go there to help team win and do whatever coach needs me to do , " Azuolas Tubelis told ESPN . " I believe that college basketball really fits my game , and I can get more exposure going to Arizona .

In addition , the Pac-12 has given schools the go-ahead to resume on-campus workouts as early as June 15 , and Arizona is expected to gather basketball players by July . <h> July showcases likely gone <p> Peach Jam and the rest of the July recruiting showcases are the latest COVID-19 basketball events likely out of the window because of the NCAA 's dead period extension . <p> Differing state regulations and even some schools that have been prohibiting staff travel are making it all but impossible to schedule recruiting events for coaches to attend this spring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional academies it held for the first time last July , while the Section 7 high school team camp scheduled for June was postponed and may be held in August or September , according to organizer Matt King . <p> The cancellations mean coaches will need to evaluate the 2021 class primarily on video of the past high school season or on previous evaluations . <h> UA offers ex-Marana player <p> D'Marco Dunn left Marana High School after the 2018-19 season without much recruiting stock , but the Wildcats are trying to bring him back . <p> Arizona became the latest high-major program to offer the 2021 shooting guard after a strong season at Westover High School in Fayetteville , North Carolina . Rated a consensus three-star prospect but four stars by 247 Sports , the 6-4 Dunn also picked up recent offers from Wake Forest and Louisville . <p> Gershon said Dunn had just one D-I offer after playing for Powerhouse Hoops last summer , from UTEP , but that his stock took off after he moved with his mother to North Carolina and helped lead Westover to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of a possible 3A state title . <p> " He 's gotten significantly better , " Gershon said .

@@41951441 <p> KUCHING : Sarawak Business Federation ( SBF ) secretary general Jonathan Chai had hoped that the Sarawak Disaster Management Committee ( SDMC ) would follow in the footsteps of the federal government by reopening most businesses from Monday ( May 4 ) . <p> " Looking at the figures of new ( Covid-19 ) positive cases of the state over the past couple of weeks , I had actually hoped that the SDMC would follow in the footsteps of the federal government by opening up our economy except those businesses involving body contact or mass gatherings with the similar standard operating procedures ( SOP ) in place . <p> " This is because such initiative would help to expedite the progress of recovery of our economy to avoid mass retrenchment of employees which would eventually bring along unwanted social problems , " he told The Borneo Post today following the announcement that SDMC and the Sarawak government had decided not to implement the Conditional Movement Control Order ( CMCO ) from May 4 onward . <p> Chai said he could understand that the Sarawak government 's decision not to follow suit had come with due consideration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarawakians . <p> He noted that it might be a bit rush for some business operators to reopen on Monday since their employees might need to make arrangements , especially those with children to look after . <p> He , however , hoped that the SDMC would make some indication even on any possibility of allowing the resumption of businesses in the immediate future . <p> " The risk of infection through body contact would be considerably less and manageable if the social distancing measure is strictly observed . <p> " The objective of the MCO is to contain the spread of the virus and flatten the curve but not completely eradicate the virus , " he said . <p> Chai opined that a prolonged MCO would incur damage to the state 's well-being , more so than the epidemic itself given that the " death rate was exponentially lower than existing non-communicable diseases or even the common flu " . <p> " While we expect people to restrict their movements during the MCO , the authorities concerned need to intensify and step up the testing of Covid-19 especially on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clusters of infection to enable to contain the spread of the virus sooner and effectively , " he pointed out . <p> He lauded the Sarawak government for conducting Covid-19 tests in the residential estates in Kota Samarahan to contain the outbreak . <p> He called upon the SDMC to come up with an exit strategy given that the current phase of MCO was scheduled to be lifted on May 12 . <p> " It is high time for the SDMC to come up with the exit strategy in the possibly final phase of the MCO and the gradual opening up of businesses will be the key agenda of that exit strategy , " added Chai .

Reproduction of any content for commercial purposes is subject to our usage terms and conditions , please email the editor at his address directly for clarification . <p> The Pound-Australian Dollar rate was in recovery mode Friday and is tipped to climb further up ahead following a punishing April month , with much of that decline likely to be retraced , although the levels produced in this correction could be the best available to Aussie Dollar buyers for a while to come . <p> Pound Sterling has stabilised against the Aussie and other commodity currencies following a sell-off that took the Pound-Australian Dollar rate -8% lower from peak-to-trough before culminating in rejection by the 200-day moving-average of prices that was sitting just above 1.89 on Thursday . April was characterised by a widespread recovery of risk assets including the Aussie Dollar and stock markets but an old adage says to " sell in May and go away . " <p> " We find that all G10 currencies broadly underperform through the month . As Chart 4 highlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) AUD , NOK and other high beta currencies weaken the most ; b ) EUR under-performs more than GBP . This pattern of FX performance strongly suggests that May is a risk-off month , " says Kamal Sharma , a strategist at BofA Global Research . " FX volatility ( using the JPM VXY index as a proxy ) rises on average and has done so particularly in the last couple of years . " <p> The May month leaves behind the opening of a new tax year and all of the related financial flows that can help to lift risk assets and is often seen weighing on markets . Sterling is a risk asset , with an average -2.3% decline against the U.S. Dollar each year since 2010 according to BofA Global Research , although the Aussie also tends to suffer even more which means the coming weeks may see the upside correction in Pound-Australian Dollar rate extend . <p> Westpac also seems to agree . <p> " The RBA and BoE are pursuing very expansionary monetary policy and fiscal support is substantial , especially in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia 's much lower Covid-19 case count should mean a quicker restarting of economic activity in Australia . These factors should ensure AUD remains well above March lows but given our baseline view on global risk appetite , we see AUD softening to GBP 0.5050/0.5100 or AUD 1.96-1.98 multi-week , " says Westpac 's Sean Callow . <p> There 's another adage that 's also still popular with investors and which could become increasingly relevant this month ; " buy the rumour and sell the fact . " May will increasingly see major economies across Europe and North America taking steps to lift ' lockdown ' measures in place when the spread of coronavirus appeared to have been succesfully curtailed , but investors may already have squeezed the last drops from that narrative and for some it may soon seem like time for economies to actually deliver some goods . <p> Quite how quickly the global economy heaves itself up out of the coronavirus trough remains to be seen although many economists and analysts are sceptical of the earlier idea that the recovery will one day resemble a " V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would illustrate a recovery that came and went as quick as the coronavirus ' peak ' . But many investors might soon decide they need to at least see some signs of recovery being on the way before chasing risk assets any higher . <p> This could be bad news for the Aussie if profit-taking leads to falling stock markets and commodity prices . The S&amp;P 500 rose 18% last month , it 's largest gain since 1987 , and the NASDAQ technology stock index climbed 21% . These performances have left major equity benchmarks carrying only the most negligible of discounts to their New Year levels , which had seen many trade at record valuations , amid the worst economic crisis seen in living memory . <p> " The Australian dollar was the strongest G10 currency in April by a significant margin , with the NZD a distant second . So is this move justified " asks Westpac 's Robert Rennie , head of financial market strategy . " We see the recent strength in the A$ as unjustified and likely to be tested in the weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are forecasting a drop to 0.62 by the end of this quarter while our fair value suggests a drop to 0.61 should be expected . " <p> The Australian Dollar rose faster than Pound Sterling in April and it could fall faster in May , which would translate into a rising Pound-Australian Dollar rate given that exchange rate always closely matches the sum of GBP/USD over AUD/USD . Westpac looks for the exchange rate to top out somewhere between 1.96 and 1.98 . Pound Sterling Live suggested in an editorial Tuesday that such a correction might lift it to somewhere between 2.00 and 2.0333 . <p> Everything remains to be determined in the month ahead but one of the few things that was clear on Friday is that as the month draws to a close the Brexit process will again impose itself on investors and traders in Pound Sterling , and the government still insists it wo n't ask for an extension of the transition period and that if the EU requests one it will say no . This is despite only " limited progress " in talks about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deadline . This could weigh heavily on Sterling . <p> The Pound-Australian Dollar began mean-reverting from what were increasingly overbought levels in April and has since bounced from the 200-day moving average , but as the global recovery begins to be crystalise in late May and June , the Aussie could again turn higher and at a time when Pound Sterling might be under increasing pressure due to Brexit and other factors . <p> That might mean substantial downside for the Pound-Aussie rate further out and that May GBP/AUD levels could be as good as they get for some time to come . <p> The Pound-Australian Dollar rate was in recovery mode Friday and is tipped by Westpac to climb further in weeks ahead following a punishing April month , with much of that decline now likely to be retraced , although the levels produced in this correction higher could be the best available to Aussie Dollar buyers for a while to come . <p> The Australian Dollar 's ongoing bout of appreciation against the likes of the Pound , Dollar and Euro comes amidst broadly improving market sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency overvalued . <p> The Pound-Australian Dollar rate was edging lower toward a key technical support level on the charts Tuesday and may attempt to stabilise over the coming days , although the fundamental headwinds are building for Sterling and October 2019 lows could now be beckoning . <p> This website carries advertisements for providers of leveraged trading products .

Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 people are reported to have died on board his vessel , and the charity M ? decins Sans Fronti ? res , which treated the survivors when they made it back to Bangladesh -- including some young children -- said that most of the survivors could n't stand or walk on their own when they reached the shore , rescued by the Bangladeshi coast guard . <p> The passengers on the boats still at sea are likely to be in a similar state .

Owners of companies , big and small , lamented they may end up laying off workers if they did not receive government aid . <p> Support the struggle to build a New Malaysia based on Justice , Freedom , Solidarity : <p> As the weeks progressed , many workers woke up each morning under a cloud of fear of losing their jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged to help workers get by financially was no match for the billions of funds and relief measures dished out by governments to keep industries safe from folding up . <p> In some countries , even the apparently " cash aid " to workers actually came from the workers ' own retirement savings in government-appointed institutions . <p> And in some cases , workers withdrawing their retirement savings ended up paying a processing fee or had to forego the interest earned . <p> Added to this assault on the dignity of human labour was the fact that governments had to plead with employers not to withhold salaries during the lockdown . <p> Meanwhile , some business owners took advantage of the Covid-19 ravages . Reports emerged of the closure of businesses that had once made profits in pre-pandemic years and decades . <p> As the world marked 2020 Labour Day , we need to re-examine human work . We need to ask if human labour has been deprived of dignity . <p> Has the toil of all human endeavours taken second place to profits ? Is the state 's safeguarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress warranted ? <p> When it comes to employees ' productivity and performance , we like to use grandiose terms like human resources or human capital . <p> But when it comes to national economies and politics , we put human labour on the backburner . Bringing financial relief to keep industries from closing down seems to be priority in this global crisis . <p> Perhaps thinkers with dignity and honour will step forward to help reshape the landscape of human labour . <p> On this 2020 Labour Day , we should reflect on the dignity of human labour and free it from the exploitation of capitalist greed . <p> A nation 's economy and progress built with the bricks and mortar of industrial development , where human labour is second to profit-making robs civilisation of its very pillars , ie human labour with dignity . <p> It is time to return dignity and honour to human toil and laborious effort so that we can keep building civilisation in a way that gives real meaning to our human existence . <p> The world has to correct the runaway wagon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival of businesses as superior to the sweat and toil of human capability , ie labour .

@@41956841 <p> The presence of antibodies probably means someone is immune for at least some amount of time and could return to work safely , which is why some experts see antibody tests as crucial to helping countries restart their economies . <p> But there are lingering doubts about whether all coronavirus infections generate antibodies and how long the protection lasts . <p> Plus , antibody tests can be inaccurate , and many people are taking tests that lack authorization from the Food and Drug Administration . <p> It 's what the protesters in Colorado , Wisconsin , and Michigan have demanded in their push to reopen nonessential businesses . It 's the goal politicians and public-health experts have in mind when developing road maps to help states forge a safe path back to some level of normality . <p> But such plans require far more testing than the US is now doing , even after a recent ramp-up .

" People who are immune could be the first people to go back to normal life and start everything up again . " <p> But " ultimately " is a long way off . As of now , we still lack several critical pieces of information about antibodies and immunity . Scientists do n't know whether everyone who has recovered from COVID-19 develops antibodies , and they do n't know the extent to which those antibodies protect us from reinfection . <p> " We expect people that are infected with COVID-19 to develop a response that has some level of protection -- what we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if that 's seen in everybody that is infected , and for how long that lasts , " Maria Van Kerkhove , an expert with the World Health Organization , said at a press briefing on Monday . <p> Plus , antibody tests are n't always accurate . <h> Does everyone who gets the coronavirus develop antibodies ? <p> Coronavirus antibody tests , also known as serological tests , use a few drops of your blood to determine whether your body has developed proteins that fight the virus . If it has , that means you 've gotten infected , recovered , and may be immune . These tests differ from the diagnostic tests that determine whether someone has an active COVID-19 infection . <p> caption <p> A health worker extracting blood from a patient to perform an antibody test for COVID-19 at the Dworska Hospital in Krakow , Poland , on April 9 . <p> source <p> Omar Marques/Getty Images <p> Research so far indicates most patients develop antibodies : A small study from European researchers found that three coronavirus patients had antibodies less than three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature reported , similarly , that patients formed antibodies within weeks . <p> But a recent paper found that of 175 recovered COVID-19 patients in China , 6% did n't develop any detectable antibodies .

Photo : AFP / Mark Wilson / Getty Images/AFP <p> A headline in Politico last week called US Senator Tom Cotton the Republican Party 's " No 1 coronavirus China hawk . " This was not an honorific title but one that was well earned and well deserved . He has been the most vicious attack dog on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 's blame China team . <p> As early as January , when the world was just beginning to grasp the full significance of Covid-19 , Cotton charged that the virus that causes the respiratory disease came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China 's Hubei province . He planted the seeds of accusation without providing any supporting evidence , but that 's how propaganda is supposed to work . <p> Sometimes he shared with the media that it may have been an accident that the Wuhan lab let the virus loose . Other times he hinted that the lab may have created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His allegations were carefully vague so that he could not be pinned down . <p> Pompeo and President Donald Trump play the same blame game even though the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a press release last Thursday stating : " The intelligence community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified . " ( Of course , this statement is subject to withdrawal , if the boss threatens to fire the DNI . ) <h> Cotton follows Ferguson <p> Cotton also accused China of deliberately letting the virus loose on the world . He was drawing on Harvard historian Niall Ferguson 's assertion that China let international flights depart from Wuhan , which was factually incorrect . Daniel Bell , a fellow academic , showed Ferguson that the Wuhan airport had shut down all flights , not just domestic ones , on January 23 . Ferguson refused to retract his allegation but stood by his lie . <p> It 's widely recognized that every lie diminishes the reputation of the perpetrator , but Cotton has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation for the economic damage and lives lost due to Covid-19 . Of course , he would never call the contagion by the official name . To him , it 's always the " Chinese " virus . <p> Cotton cleverly thought he could lead a lawsuit to cancel the trillion-dollar IOU the US government owes China . Frankly , that 's going to a lot of trouble to weasel out of a trillion-dollar debt . It would be much easier for the US Federal Reserve simply to print one or two or three trillion dollars with the snap of congressional fingers . Larry Kudlow , President Trump 's economic adviser , also shuddered at the thought of what such a default would do to the creditworthiness of the dollar . <p> More recently , Cotton thought out loud on Fox News that it was fine for students from China to come to the US to study Shakespeare but not for quantum computing or artificial intelligence . That was a strange juxtaposition . <h> Study football at Arkansas <p> Of course , if Chinese students aspire to become Shakespeare scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The University of Arkansas might be a backup choice if a student could n't get into the University of Alabama to study college football . <p> Cotton appears to be under the notion that Chinese students majoring in science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) come to the US to steal secrets . Quantum computing and artificial intelligence happen to be two disciplines that American scholars are just as likely to go to China to study as vice versa . In some ways , China is as up to date and may be even ahead of the US . <p> It 's apparent that Cotton does n't understand much about STEM education at the university and postgraduate levels . There are a bit over a million international students in the US and slightly more than one-third are from China . Most of them are funded by their families . Since Beijing is not paying their way , there 's no need to spy for their tuition . <p> More important , foreign students pay full tuition and represent a significant source of revenue for American colleges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEM departments depend on the quality of their students to maintain the quality of the research output and thus maintaining their reputation for excellence . A recent survey showed that among nationalities , students from China ranked second-highest in IQ while American students came in at No 28 . That 's why top-tier schools such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Stanford and others aggressively recruit students from China . <p> Another surprising revelation was that the five most popular majors among the Chinese students were business management , computer science , finance , mathematics and economics , in that order . This suggests that students from China are not just coming to the US for STEM but are just as interested in learning how to manage businesses the way it is done in the West . <p> Students from China have discovered that they are four times as likely to be a victim of a violent crime while in the US ( and this was before the Covid-19 pandemic induced xenophobia ) than if they stayed home . In addition , with Trump 's randomly arbitrary granting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US is flagging . A decade ago , enrollment in the US increased by nearly 30% every year . For the academic year 2018-19 , the increase was only 1.7% . <h> Lancet : the US screwed up <p> Cotton was also part of the chorus accusing China of covering up the seriousness of the virus . Not so , said Richard Horton , editor-in-chief of Lancet , who praised China 's international cooperation and pointed to five papers published in January . It was the US , the UK and other countries in the West that squandered February and March , he lamented . <p> Lancet is a world-renowned , peer-reviewed medical research scientific journal . An open statement signed by 27 scientists from around the world was published on February 19 in Lancet declaring their solidarity with all scientists and health professionals in China . <p> Their open letter in part said : " The rapid , open , and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumors and misinformation around its origins . We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> At the end of April , the world was greeted with the news that the first double-blind , international study had found remdesivir , an antiviral medication made by Gilead , to be somewhat effective in helping a patient recover from Covid-19 . Not a miraculous cure or vaccine to be sure , but a step in the right direction , and the stock market responded positively . <p> A paper on the findings was published in Lancet under a title that included the words " a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center trial . " The clinical trials were performed in China and the investigators were Chinese . It 's an example of the benefits of international collaboration and cooperation . <p> The adage " Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth " is often attributed to Joseph Goebbels , Adolf Hitler 's minister of propaganda . Even if Pompeo , Cotton et al succeed in blackening China and obscuring its contribution , how will the world and the American people benefit from the absence of cross-border collaboration ?

@@41963241 <p> Why 's that , you ask ? Well , because this marks a year since I have been doing this random thoughts column for ESPN.com . <p> The column has evolved over time , but I 'm going back to how it started . Random thoughts . Lord knows I have plenty . <p> And away we go ... <p> 1 . If Tony Ferguson vs . Justin Gaethje actually happens on May 9 , I feel like Nathan Diaz will be the big winner . How so ? Well , let 's say Ferguson beats Gaethje . That should guarantee a Ferguson-Khabib Nurmagomedov fight in the fall , right ? It would also knock Gaethje out of a top rankings spot . Who was Gaethje supposed to fight in July ? Conor McGregor . No chance they do that fight if Gaethje is coming off a loss , right ? OK , what if Gaethje wins , you ask ? Then he fights Nurmagomedov , right ? Again , freeing up McGregor . Now , in this scenario they could do Ferguson vs . McGregor , but I also feel like either May 9 scenario opens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , if May 9 actually happens , do n't be surprised if Diaz emerges as a player in the McGregor sweepstakes . <h> UFC 249 coverage <p> UFC 249 is expected to have a card loaded with star power , featuring two title fights . Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje , two of the UFC 's most exciting fighters , will compete for the interim 155-pound title in the main event , and Henry Cejudo will defend the bantamweight title against former titleholder Dominick Cruz . <p> 2 . I wonder if Amanda Nuneswithdrawing from her May 9 fight against Felicia Spencer will be a sign of things to come in this sense : The top draws -- the champions -- always have way more to lose than the contenders in this game . If things are n't perfect , it 's a lot more alarming for them than for someone who is chasing the belt . In other words , Nunes would have had a ton more to lose on May 9 than Spencer , so it 's no surprise she pulled out first . Will other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't bet against it . <p> 3 . That said , I really hope Nunes ' next fight is against Spencer , whenever that time comes . I think Spencer can give her a tough fight , especially if they go to the ground . <p> 4 . Henry Cejudo deserved all the criticism in the world when he campaigned for the Jose Aldo fight , but I do n't think he deserves much criticism for the Dominick Cruz fight . Why ? Well , for starters , Aldo ca n't enter the country . Next , Petr Yan ca n't enter the country . Then , Aljamain Sterling is still not 100% following wrist surgery , and Cory Sandhagen has already said it 's too hard to fully prepare for a fight these days , although he told USA Today he would step in if Cruz dropped out for whatever reason . There are no other options out there , and Cruz is the biggest fight possible , even if everyone were available . Do n't forget , without Dominick Cruz there is no bantamweight division . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm still not completely sold on the idea that Fight Island will happen , but I will say that after speaking to several fighters who were on the Dana White-hosted conference calls this week , the impression they got is that Fight Island is very real . According to them , White reiterated several times that it would be a thing , and soon . We shall see . <p> 6 . I want to give a lot of credit to Lyman Good . It 's never easy being the first to speak about anything personal , but he was the first active UFC fighter to reveal he had the coronavirus . That takes a lot of guts . I wonder if others will follow suit . Nevertheless , I 'm very glad to hear he and his loved ones are doing well and have since tested negative . <p> play <p> 3:36 <h> Lyman Good reveals he tested positive for coronavirus <p> Lyman Good explains the timeline that led to him testing positive for the coronavirus and pulling out his scheduled fight for April 18 . <p> 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire season , though I think it ultimately made the right call . It will be interesting to see if it is able to hold one-off events later in the year , and if so , does the PFL just put together the most fun fights possible ? I would suggest doing that . Heck , put together a card with four fights and sprinkle in some classic WSOF fights on the broadcast . A lot of fans have n't seen those yet . Give us some Justin Gaethje , Marlon Moraes and Anthony Johnson action . Who says no ? <p> 8 . Speaking of the PFL , I commend it for paying the fighters a monthly stipend , but I am reserving full judgment until we find out how much it is actually paying . A lot of these fighters will now be forced to sit on the sidelines for over a year . A lot of them signed with the PFL in hopes of winning the million-dollar purse . Will the stipend come anywhere near the money they would have made if they fought multiple times this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made for letting them out of their deals in 2020 , only to be back under contract in 2021 ? This will be interesting to monitor . <p> 9 . I am happy that the UFC renamed its May 9 event UFC 249 and not UFC 250 . I always thought it was weird that it just skipped over UFC 151 and 177 back in the day . This makes me feel good . <p> 10 . The Virginia commission denied Ion Cutelaba 's appeal of his controversial TKO loss to Magomed Ankalaev in February . I thought the stoppage was early , but I am not surprised at all the appeal was denied . It 's virtually impossible to get one of those calls overturned , even if the calls are egregious . I wish that was n't the case . <p> 11 . Speaking of Cutelaba , his team tells me he is now in quarantine in his home country of Moldova for another week after he decided to fly from there to Las Vegas for the April 18 card that never happened . I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without knowing where the card was going to take place , only to be forced to return home once the event was canceled . No word on how much they will be compensated for their troubles . <p> 12 . I 'm told the fighters who were slated to compete on the ill-fated London card on March 21 received no more than $20,000 . As you can imagine , some of the higher earners are n't too pleased with that amount , while others were happy to get something for nothing . <p> 13 . The more time passes , the more I think it would be a really bad idea to not book Jon Jones vs . Dominick Reyes 2 right away . Yes , I know Jan Blachowicz looked great against Corey Anderson , but does anyone really think the Blachowicz fight is bigger financially and more intriguing than the Reyes fight ? I sure do n't . <p> 14 . I initially thought it was n't a great idea for Tony Ferguson to make weight last week for a fight that was n't happening , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different kind of cat . He thrives under circumstances like this . He ca n't just take his foot off the gas . Also , let 's not pretend fighters have n't made weight twice in a month . Heck , Chris Leben once fought twice in the span of two weeks . At least Ferguson did n't get punched after making weight last Friday . So , it was a chore , no doubt , but now he 's back to normal and gears up for May 9 . I do n't think there are more than five fighters on the roster who would do this , but that 's what makes him so unique . Do you , Tony . <p> play <p> 0:22 <h> Ferguson cuts weight despite fight cancellation <p> Tony Ferguson cuts and appears to make weight a day before he was scheduled to fight in the main event of UFC 249 . <p> 15 . It was fun reminiscing with Strikeforce alum ( and former champion ) Daniel Cormier about the glory days of the promotion on Monday 's episode of DC &amp; Helwani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was sold to Zuffa . I fear newer fans will never know just how special this promotion was and the amazing stars it built in a short amount of time . Some of my favorite events that I ever covered back in the day were those Bay Area Strikeforce shows , and so , with that in mind , here are my top 10 Strikeforce fights that you should watch right now ( spoiler-free ) : <p> 1 . Frank Shamrock vs . Cesar Gracie , March 2006 -- the first Strikeforce MMA main event . Got ta watch this one for the sake of history . <p> So many more to choose from , but I 'll go with those 10 . I feel bad leaving out some great ones like Tate vs . Julie Kedzie , Luke Rockhold vs . Jacare Souza , Cormier vs . Josh Barnett , but alas ... Go watch those and report back to me . Great memories .

@@41966241 <p> Gemma Peters , chief executive of Blood Cancer UK , is worried . The coronavirus lockdown has had a drastic effect on cancer care . Data now emerging suggests that , within the past two months , two-week urgent referrals for cancer tests and diagnoses have fallen by an average of 76 per cent in some places . It 's a " horrendous " situation , says Peters . <p> Delays can be particularly deadly for certain cancer patients , she explains . For instance , people with blood cancer can find that it takes a relatively long time before they receive a diagnosis -- often because symptoms of the disease are difficult to distinguish from other conditions . " We 're going to have a whole load of people with blood cancers being diagnosed later , " says Peters . That means worse outcomes for patients , more pressure on the healthcare system and the worrying possibility that those patients , who might be identified when their cancer has progressed to a more severe stage , will not be well enough to take part in clinical trials of drugs that could help them . <h> Advertisement <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another problem : reduced funding for cancer charities . Blood Cancer UK is currently forecasting that it will lose ? 6 million in funding this financial year thanks , in part , to the cancellation of fundraising events during the lockdown .

There are signs that diagnoses of the disease in those age groups has fallen off a cliff , according to Peters .

In terms of treatment , hospitals are setting up hubs designed to be free of Covid-19 . Cancer patients can visit such facilities in order to have surgery , for example . However , Cancer Research UK has said that , to date , the provision of these hubs in Wales has been slow , whereas 21 centres have been established in England . <p> Problems do n't just lie in the availability of services .

Late diagnoses could mean cancers that are more difficult to treat and patients who suffer from worse symptoms , the statement adds.The UKONS says that patients with weight loss , unexplained bleeding , new lumps or any other potential cancer symptoms should report them to their GP . <h> Read next <h> Boris Johnson is about to face his coronavirus trolley problem <p> ByGian Volpicelli <p> A group of researchers in the UK recently published a preprint paper detailing the drop-off in urgent cancer referrals , based on information from two London hospitals , one hospital in Leeds and all the Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland . The team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might arise during the pandemic . <h> Advertisement <p> Chemotherapy attendances were down 60 per cent on average and urgent referrals were down 76 per cent on average , the researchers found . There has been much discussion about the extent to which urgent referrals have fallen across the country . On May 1 , the Health and Social Care Committee heard from Cally Palmer , the National Cancer Director , that the reduction in appointments was 62 per cent . <p> " We absolutely have evidence that the number of urgent referrals for early diagnosis ... has plummeted , " says Harry Hemingway at UCL 's Institute of Health Informatics , one of the preprint 's co-authors . However , Hemingway argues that not enough data is available to give a full picture of what 's happening to cancer healthcare across the NHS . Information from the national cancer registry or real-time , UK-wide data on hospital admissions , for example , would help fill in the gaps , he says . <p> The study he and his colleagues made relied instead on records supplied by the aforementioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to share their data so quickly was a " remarkable achievement " , says Hemingway . <p> His team also used a model to estimate that there will be a total of 17,915 excess deaths in England among new and existing cancer patients after one year . That includes deaths caused by either cancer , Covid-19 or other health issues -- there is n't sufficient data to be more specific , says Hemingway . Plus , the model does not reveal the number of deaths that could be caused because of missed or late cancer diagnoses during the lockdown -- again , Prof Hemingway says he and his team would require more data to model that . But the analysis remains an indication of how perilous the current situation is for cancer patients . <h> Read next <h> How coronavirus started and what happens next , explained <p> ByMatt Reynolds and Sabrina Weiss <p> Other estimates paint an even starker picture . Karol Sikora is chief medical officer of Rutherford Cancer Centres , a network of cancer clinics in the UK . He says his " back-of-the-envelope " calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no change in the uptake of referrals for diagnosis and treatment for a total of six months . The figure is based on the fact that 180,000 treatable cancer patients are identified every year in the UK but a third of them could pass away if everyone 's treatment is delayed by six months . That would mean 60,000 deaths , says Sikora . <p> It should be noted that while chemotherapy and operations remain cancelled for many , some hospitals are now starting to offer such treatments again . Some have questioned whether the government could have begun relaxing the lockdown sooner in order to avoid such a catastrophe . On April 8 , Sikora said on Twitter that he thought the UK had reached the peak of infections and that the country would be able to begin easing the lockdown by April 27 . However , the numbers of Covid-19 cases reported each day remained flat for the following fortnight . <p> " It has been slower than I thought , " he now says . In a recent article published on ITV 's website , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictive measures that it had . <p> The frontline of the cancer diagnostic system is GPs surgeries . It is there that patients may first raise their symptoms with a health professional who can then refer them on for scans or tests that can show whether they have cancer . And GPs surgeries are where the public 's current reluctance to engage with the healthcare system is being noticed . <p> Neil Bhatia is a GP in Hampshire . He says that many patients are continuing to stay in touch via an online system called eConsult . It allows patients to send in queries about their health -- and even attach photos of visible symptoms . Bhatia and his colleagues spend their days working through submissions filed online in this way and responding to patients , for example , via telephone appointments . While there is still plenty of work to do , Dr Bhatia says he is aware that people 's willingness to contact their doctor has changed . " I do think patients are thinking twice , " he says . " They have the misconception that unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NHS at all . " <h> Read next <h> ' I 'm furious ' : Failing care homes are the real coronavirus scandal <p> BySabrina Weiss <p> The idea that patients are not disclosing important symptoms is alarming many GPs .

" GP referrals " save lives " he notes , adding , " We ca n't stress enough how important it is that patients with any concerns about their health , not just potential cancer symptoms , seek the appropriate medical attention . " <p> Bhatia agrees , and points out that there is a wide range of diseases beyond cancer to think about . For instance , patients might think that their persistent cough is a coronavirus symptom and simply follow the official advice on how to manage Covid-19 . However , a chronic cough could indicate something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peters also notes that some symptoms of blood cancer including fatigue , fever and breathing difficulties , could also be mistaken for Covid-19 . <p> Then there are other signs and symptoms that patients might think they can put up with for a while but which really should be urgently addressed . " It could be something like rheumatoid arthritis , " says Bhatia . " The longer you leave the arthritis active , the more joint destruction happens . ... They 're the sort of person you would want to refer to a specialist soon . " <p> Delaying treatment can have potentially disastrous consequences . Anna , not her real name , is convinced that her father 's heart attack could have been avoided if it had n't been for social distancing and the pressure on health services . <p> She says her father , a throat cancer survivor , had been experiencing discomfort in his chest for around two weeks before the heart attack occurred . Since the incident , he has commented that he considered mentioning the pain at his wife 's cardiology appointment -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that the lockdown was ultimately a necessary measure , adds that in normal circumstances her father might have mentioned his symptoms in passing to a family member .

" They 've told him he 's been very , very lucky , " says Anna . <p> The government says that it is OK to visit vulnerable and elderly relatives , though such visits should only occur when they are deemed " essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical but it might also leave fewer opportunities for a person to mention symptoms they have been experiencing and , therefore , a greater chance for serious conditions , besides Covid-19 , to go undiagnosed . <p> That is perhaps the main reason why this " other " public health crisis is unfolding alongside Covid-19 -- broken connections between people . Whether it 's GPs seeing fewer patients with cancer symptoms , or families divided , a breakdown in communication is a threat to public health , says Bhatia . <p> " The intention was never to not communicate with each other -- it was just not to communicate face to face , " he says .

Photo : AFP <p> The economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic is only just picking up pace in Russia , and yet it has already delivered unexpected changes . During the past month private philanthropy surged , helping to address the impacts of the Covid-19 outbreak and shortages of clear-cut counter-policies . <p> The rise of private philanthropy in times of crisis is a rather ordinary phenomenon across the developed economies and Western societies , as it helps to offset occasionally slow governmental measures that might cost lives . During the Ebola outbreak , charity giving topped US$362 million , and the current pandemic has elicited an even greater response . <p> The latest data reveal that global private philanthropic response to the Covid-19 pandemic has raised more than $1 billion -- an unprecedented amount commensurate with the extraordinary disruption of the current crisis .

" <p> David , Kym and Mason , along with English footballer Kallum Higginbotham and two Scottish coaches , were told their journey could have been even worse . <p> " We were asked if we 'd made it through the borders OK , because two militants had just been shot and as a result everything was shut down , " said the former Scotland international .

@@41973241 <p> After seven weeks of lockdown and more than 30,000 deaths , the first phase of the UK 's coronavirus outbreak is slowly drawing to a close . On Sunday April 10 , prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a slight relaxing of distancing rules that should see exercise limits relaxed , but is likely to be a long way off the kind of national unshackling splashed across tabloid front pages on April 7 . <p> Easing the UK 's lockdown will depend on us managing to prevent another spike in coronavirus cases like the one which pushed the NHS to its very limits in late March . The government is hoping that the NHS contact tracing app , currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight , will allow it to stay on top of new Covid-19 cases and stop them before they spiral into localised outbreaks . <h> Advertisement <p> The contact tracing app -- already dogged by concerns over privacy and its effectiveness -- is only the technological heart of the UK 's contact tracing plan . The government is also hiring 18,000 contact tracers to do the leg work of identifying people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease to and following up with those contacts to ensure they do n't continue the chain of transmission . <p> But there are signs that the UK 's contact tracing plans are already on shaky foundations . After largely dropping contact testing on March 12 , the UK 's scheme will be taking off from a standing start . Wide-scale testing , which forms the central part of any contact tracing scheme , is already faltering as the government has hit its self-imposed 100,000-a-day testing target just twice since it was announced . And scientists are dubious that , with local authority health departments eviscerated by years of cuts , contact tracing teams will have the detailed local knowledge required to carry out effective contact tracing . <h> Read next <h> This startup helps self-isolating surgeons work from home <p> ByJo ? o Medeiros <p> Lessons from other countries that have implemented effective contact tracing regimes show the scale of the challenge now facing the UK . In Singapore , which is currently seeing a spike in cases after keeping them low for many weeks , all suspected coronavirus cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases were placed under mandatory quarantine for 14 days . Although the country was one of the first to release an automated contact tracing app , it has relied on a network of police officers and army staff to trace thousands of contacts each day . <p> " If you ask me whether any Bluetooth contact tracing system deployed or under development , anywhere in the world , is ready to replace manual contact tracing , I will say without qualification that the answer is , No , " wrote Jason Bay , the product lead for TraceTogether , Singapore 's contact-tracing app , in a blog post . <h> Advertisement <p> Simply tracing contacts is n't enough . In South Korea , moderately sick Covid-19 patients are sent to isolation dorms at converted workplaces , while asymptotic contacts of recent cases must follow strict self-quarantine at home and use separate bathrooms and cooking equipment from cohabitants . Dedicated contact tracers follow-up with contacts twice daily to see if they have developed symptoms . In China , mild cases were also sent to isolation wards to recover . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-of-home isolation , but this could be helpful for particularly vulnerable people says Gabriel Scally , a professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a former regional director for public health . People who share crowded homes could be putting their household at risk if they isolate at home , he says . " There would be a good case in my view for helping the person spend their period of isolation somewhere they would n't have such direct contact with others . " <p> Doing so would require local expertise and spare accommodation capacity . " There is a need for local knowledge , particularly around the close contact issue , " Scally says . Local contact tracers would be more familiar with likely contact hot-spots in communities and also better set-up to contact people who are more vulnerable or likely to be completely isolated . <h> Read next <h> How to make a face mask using what you already have at home <p> BySabrina Weiss <p> This is n't the approach that the UK is taking .

Even if they wanted to , a decade of cuts to council budgets mean that local public health departments simply do n't have the staffing to run widespread contact tracing , Jim McManus , director of public health for Hertfordshire County Council says that he is operating with a third less staff than he had in 2005 . " We have expertise and experience ; we do n't have capacity in and of ourselves to deliver this national system .

A study from Shenzhen in China found that contact tracing reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average of 4.6 days after the first sign of infection down to 2.7 days . But this still leaves a window where people are possibly spreading the infection without knowing it . As an editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine notes , transmission from people who are n't showing symptoms yet ( or never show symptoms ) is one of the major challenges we 're facing in combating the disease . Narrowing the window of asymptomatic transmission will mean tracking contacts extremely closely and making sure they have rapid access to tests . <p> And contact tracing itself is only one part of the puzzle . The government is reportedly already preparing to cut wage subsidies while an additional 600,000 young people are facing unemployment in the next year . Without a financial safety net , people in precarious employment may be unable to comply with strict self-isolation requirements . <p> By the time the government 's mid-May hiring deadline comes around , it will have been two months since the UK last widely pursued contact tracing .

The syndrome , first reported in London , has been compared to other autoimmune conditions such as Kawasaki disease ( KD ) and toxic shock syndrome ( TSS ) . But in interviews with Yahoo Life , multiple pediatricians say that the illness is increasingly different from those illnesses -- and that the symptoms are unmistakable . <p> " I believe and I think many people believe it 's a different problem , a different syndrome that 's not typical Kawasaki disease , " says Dr. Stanford Shulman , a professor of pediatrics with a focus on infectious disease at Northwestern University . " This syndrome has a few features similar to Kawasaki , but many more features that are very different .

Here is what to look for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been reported in New York thus far , doctors in Boston , Philadelphia , Los Angeles and -- according to Shulman -- Chicago now say that they 've seen suspected cases as well .

Many of the kids have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies , suggesting that they contracted the virus weeks before and recovered . <p> Given that timeline , experts believe that more cases will be appearing in other states in the coming weeks . To help alleviate fears among parents , here 's what the experts know thus far . <h> Two key symptoms are high fever and gastrointestinal distress <p> Shulman says that one of the biggest differences between this new syndrome and KD is the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms . " The symptoms patients are presenting with ... there 's lots of abdominal pain and diarrhea , which are very uncommon in Kawasaki children , " says Shulman . The other obvious symptom is a fever above 102 ? F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fevers , lots of abdominal pain -- with or without diarrhea or vomiting -- and looks really sick , they need to go to an emergency room to be evaluated . " Other symptoms to look for include rash , conjunctivitis and difficulty breathing . <h> Shock is likely what is driving the fatalities <p> Dr. Steven Kernie , chief of pediatric critical care medicine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital , has seen multiple cases of the syndrome as well and says that , aside from abdominal pain and high fever , parents should look out for symptoms of shock , such as clammy skin and racing heart rate . Shock , according to the Mayo Clinic , is defined as " a sudden drop in blood flow " that can deprive the organs of blood and oxygen . <p> This reaction seems to align more with toxic shock syndrome , which is caused by a bacterial infection , than KD . " It 's the shock piece that is different ... where they need to be in the ICU and they need to be on medications to help their heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a press conference Monday , health officials in New York said they 've seen evidence that shock in these patients is causing " multi-organ failure .

" <h> It is unlikely to be contagious <p> Both Kernie and Shulman say the syndrome is essentially a " hyper-inflammation " in the body , typically post-infection . But while COVID-19 is very easy to pass on to others , Kernie says this syndrome is not transmissible . " It 's not running in families , and it 's not contagious , " says Kernie . " Although we 're seeing a lot of it now , we have seen things like Kawasaki disease that oftentimes occur after a viral infection , so I believe that it 's really just because of the sheer volume of kids that have been exposed to COVID that we 're seeing a cluster of cases .

But Kernie says that 's not the case here . " We 've called our colleagues in Japan who are Kawasaki experts , and they 're not seeing any of this . None . Same thing for China , " says Shulman . He notes that it 's too soon to draw any conclusions about who is most at risk , but he reveals that six out of the eight children in London with the syndrome were of Afro-Caribbean descent . " So far , the demographics are very different , " he says . No data on the demographics of the kids affected in the U.S. has been released , but the National Institutes of Health has begun studying the syndrome . <h> Toddlers do not appear to be at heightened risk <p> Another marked change from KD , which generally affects children under 5 , and TSS , which is most common among teens , is the demographic affected . " The average age of this new syndrome is about 8 to 12 years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shulman says . In New York , officials say , the patients range in age from 5 to 9 years old . <h> Doctors have been using the same treatment used for KD , and it 's working <p> Treatment for KD is typically what 's known as intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) , a concentrated amount of healthy antibodies from thousands of blood donors .

@@41979741 <h> COVID-19 and obligations under lease agreements <p> Severe economic uncertainty looms over the world economy . General financial advice is to reduce expenses and save cash . For large business houses lease rentals are usually the third highest fixed monthly expense after employment and labour costs and the cost of bank borrowing . Of a number of apparent legal solutions to the problem of cost reduction the most controversial is the demand of tenants that the lease rent be waived or significantly reduced , failing which the lease will be abandoned due to the COVID-19 crisis . <p> Lease agreements , leave and licensing agreements and informal lease agreements are governed by the Transfer of Property Act , 1908 ( TPA ) , and the Indian Contract Act , 1872 ( contract act ) . The main argument is whether the COVID-19 crisis qualifies as a force majeure event , or as an event that frustrates the purpose and intent of the lease agreement . Section 105 of the TPA defines a lease of immovable property as " a transfer of a right to enjoy such property , made for a certain time , express or implied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or promised ... to the transferor by the transferee , who accepts the transfer on such terms " . <p> The effects of exceptional circumstances are set out in section 108(e) : " if by fire , tempest or flood , or violence of an army or of a mob , or other irresistible force , any material part of the property be wholly destroyed or rendered substantially and permanently unfit for the purposes for which it was let , the lease shall , at the option of the lessee , be void " . <p> Force majeure means a chance or irresistible natural occurrence or unavoidable accident that causes damage or disruption and that is neither caused nor preventable by humans even when exercising the utmost skill , care , diligence , or prudence . Section 56 of the contract act defines frustrated agreements as contracts to do acts which , after the contracts are made , become impossible or unlawful because of some event which the promisor could not prevent , and therefore , become void . <p> The lessee holding a property is the owner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but under section 56 of the contract act the agreement is not frustrated since the current crisis has only temporarily delayed the benefits available from the property . The current COVID-19 crisis is serious and long but not indefinite and is not a situation where a return to normalcy is unlikely . Force majeure is applicable but only for a limited period and not in a manner that will irreversibly change the economic situation . <p> Lease agreements are further excluded from the doctrine of frustration of a contract as defined under section 56 of the contract act by the case of Raja Dhruv Dev Chand v Harmohinder Singh and Anr ( 1968 ) . The Supreme Court held that by its express terms section 56 of the contract act does not apply to cases in which there is a completed transfer . Under a lease , there is a transfer of the right to enjoy the land . If any material part of the property is wholly destroyed or rendered substantially and permanently unfit for the purpose for which it was let out because of fire or other irresistible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property leased is not destroyed or left substantially and permanently unfit , the lessee can not avoid the lease simply because he does not or is unable to use the land for the purposes for which it is let . <p> The leased property is being held by the lessee as a limited time owner , and any short-term disturbances would not affect the ability of the property to generate profits . Just as the lessor does not share the profits of the lessee they would have no share of the losses due to non-utilization in the current crisis . <p> The section 56 doctrine of frustration of the contract would not be applicable according to established law and by the fact that the disruption is a delay and not the termination of the usage of the property . Force majeure is applicable for a limited period but is not an event that removes the ability of the lessee to utilize the leased premises . <p> Compromise and discussion between a landlord and tenant during this crisis is the best way to resolve lease rental disputes .

' <p> To back up his indignation at the idea of the Newcastle United takeover going ahead , he uses some very emotive language : ' Given the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual freedoms , sentencing for law breakers , and the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 -- whose death was allegedly ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , this news will make many people shudder . ' <p> Karl McCartney may well be ' shuddering ' now but interesting to see which way he voted back in October 2016 , on a far more important matter than who does or does n't own a football club . <p> A parliamentary vote on 26 October 2016 regarding UK Support for Saudi Arabia-led Coalition Forces in Yemen , the shameful war where so many innocent civilians have suffered and which has brought worldwide condemnation . <p> The motion was : <p> ' That this House <p> Supports efforts to bring about a cessation of hostilities and provide humanitarian relief in Yemen , and notes that the country is now on the brink of famine ; <p> Condemns the reported bombings of civilian areas that have exacerbated this crisis ; <p> Believes that a full independent UN-led investigation must be established into alleged violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its support for the Saudi Arabia-led coalition forces in Yemen until it has been determined whether they have been responsible for any such violations . ' <p> For some strange reason , McCartney was n't so outraged with Saudi Arabia back then , when he refused to vote for the motion and backed the ongoing misery for so many innocent people . <p> Maybe I have simply missed it but I ca n't remember this Tory MP leading a campaign condemning the likes of Boris Johnson cosying up to the Saudis , neither did I see him chaining himself to the railings of Buckingham Palace when the Queen entertained the Saudi regime . This Conservative government is very much encouraging Saudi / UK relations , particularly investments in business , whilst billions of pounds of arms have been supplied by UK companies to the Saudis , including some used in the war in Yemen . <p> It makes you wonder how Karl McCartney does n't ' shudder ' permanently , when he is happy to be a member of a ruling party in this country that are working hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For 12 years ( and counting ) Manchester United have been banking fortunes via commercial deals with the Saudi regime and yet nobody seems to care about that . Maybe McCartney 's campaign against Man Utd dealing with the Saudi regime has been totally missed by the media ... <p> ' We are now faced with a true football travesty -- and I say this as a Tranmere Rovers , Liverpool , and Lincoln City fan . <p> Newcastle United ( NUFC ) -- the club of England football legends , such as Alan Shearer , John Barnes , Paul Gascoigne , Kevin Keegan , Sir Bobby Robson and many others -- is set to have 80 per cent of its finances supplied by Saudi Arabia 's Public Investment Fund . <p> Given the country 's levels of personal prosecution , rules and regulations regarding individual freedoms , sentencing for law breakers , and the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 -- whose death was allegedly ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , this news will make many people shudder . <p> For me , the most insidious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bad thing -- but it should n't come at the expense of everything else . Yet that is the core aim of the buyers : Yasir Al-Rumayyan , the nominated Chairman , is on record as saying the most important thing for him with any investment is a double-digit return for Saudi Arabia -- not English football . <p> A mass investment in the club , part of our national game , akin to the likes of the Manchester City FC purchase , this is not . <p> Of course , Saudi Arabia , or its operatives , has for years been undermining British football by operating the now-notorious pirate broadcaster " beoutQ " . Indeed the Saudis are in the enviable position of currently not paying anything to watch world-class football -- unlike every other country in the free world . <p> Now , if this purchase goes through , not only will they receive their UK football on TV for free , they will also reap the rewards from legitimate rights-payers like Sky , BT and beIN Sports , who all pay huge sums for broadcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That , to me -- as the Chairman of the UKPFC APPG -- is mightily important and should not be overlooked . <p> All the while , the rule of law -- for which this country , our country , prides itself -- is ridden over roughshod by the Saudis . Not for the first time , some might rightfully point out . It is an outrage . <p> Two weeks ago now , my colleague , Oliver Dowden , Secretary of State , refused to be drawn on this issue when he appeared before the Digital , Culture , Media and Sport Select Committee . Understandable , perhaps . No-one wants to confront a country which has historically been one of our biggest export markets , and so I have some limited sympathy with him . <p> But frankly , the Premier League , Wimbledon , Horse Racing and Formula One are some of our country 's greatest sporting exports . And football fans across the UK , and there are many of us , deserve better from their Government than Dowden 's dodging . <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus crisis , early last week it emerged in another DCMS Committee inquiry session that broadcast revenues for the Premier League ( totalling ? 3 billion ) barely cover total player wages ( ? 2.9 billion ) . <p> Anything that undermines the value of UK football risks driving down the value of broadcast revenues , putting at risk clubs ' financial sustainability . This means that British football could struggle to attract the kind of talent we have come to expect and admire . <p> We know this risk is very real . beIN Media Group , one of the broadcasters most affected by Saudi piracy , has already had to shed a third of jobs and discontinued broadcasting Formula One as a direct result of beoutQ 's piracy , I am informed . That decision cost the sport seven per cent of its revenue , totalling around ? 30 million a year . <p> Given the hit UK sport has already taken as a result of Covid-19 , clubs could find themselves teetering on the brink of survival if they suffer that kind of a financial loss unilaterally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said they are committed to continuing their support of the Premier League through rights purchases . But as beIN 's CEO Yousef Al-Obaidly said to the LEADERS in Sport Conference at Twickenham just last year , beoutQ represents an existential threat to the whole industry . Sky has also tried to take legal action against Saudi Arabia , to no avail . <p> The BBC , one of our most cherished national institutions ( if you believe the BBC and its Labour friends in and outside of the corporation ) , has been raising this as a grave concern with the Government and with the European Commission for years , and yet the state-sanctioned piracy continues . <p> What is to be done ? Last year the Government said it was committed to tackling what they recognised was an immediate threat , as a matter of urgency , yet very little has happened since . <p> That is a disgrace . It 's time we took this seriously . The stakes could not be higher for UK football as an entity . It 's time to stop gambling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best way to start is to block , at the very least delay , the Saudi purchase of Newcastle United -- and at least impose some sanctions before allowing it to progress . <p> Otherwise this will lead to wage reductions ( perhaps overdue ) , less taxes paid , and more clubs under financial pressure and vulnerable to takeover . <p> I believe in free markets , but I also believe in a level playing field and not trying to ' pull a fast one ' . It is time we sent them , and others around the world , a message loud and clear : hands off our football , stop stealing our national assets and play by the rules -- or suffer the consequences . <p> ( You can contact our MP friend at the following email address if you have anything you would like to share with him email protected or alternatively his Twitter address is @karlmccartney ) <h> Have your say <h> Newsletter <p> Get your daily update and weekly newsletter by signing up today ! <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your consent for The Mag to send you email marketing messages and process personal data .

@@41988441 <p> While the role of behavioural science in the UK 's handling of the pandemic has been criticised , Peter John and Gerry Stoker argue that it is important for governments to try and influence citizens ' behaviour rather than rely on laws that are harder to enforce . They nevertheless explain why a different ' nudging ' approach ought to have been used in this case . <p> Countries across the world have been turning to behavioural science in the fight against coronavirus . In May , The New Scientistproclaimed that ' behavioural science is absolutely central to our fight against the pandemic ' . The well-recognised role of epidemiologists , immunologists , and other scientists is limited ' unless we also factor in the science of human behaviour -- how real humans in the real world act and think -- our understanding is incomplete , and our attempts to defeat the virus will fail ' . But just as the hard sciences have struggled to come up with the answers that can be translated into policy decisions , so too has behavioural science . <p> It is vital , of course , to recognise the scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus and its effects have made decision-making difficult . Lack of data and a shortage of information about the transmission and spread of the virus has meant more reliance on assumptions than ideal . Medical practices and interventions have developed through learning on the spot . <p> Although interventions are claimed to be driven by science , that interface has also proved to be problematic across the board , but especially so in the UK where politicians have been keen to use ' the ' science as a protective cover as part of a strategy of blame avoidance and have , as ever , tended to favour the evidence that most nearly matches their political preferences . Choices about what science to follow have been made and behavioural science has played to decision-makers ' preferences for a top-down approach . <p> Phase 1 for behavioural science-based policy was all about developing and reinforcing a strong and clear messaging about staying at home , social distancing , and taking pressures off the NHS . Phase 2 , launched for England on 13 May , has offered a new top-down brief to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages about what it might be possible to do or not . Could the behavioural sciences have found a better path ? <p> As we argued in Nudge , Nudge , Think , Think , much of behavioural science lends itself to that kind of top-down approach because its underlying thinking is that people tend to be limited in cognitive terms , and that a paternalistic expert-led government needs to save them from themselves . The relative secrecy and lack of transparency of British government has compounded this problem , particularly recently when its messaging has got more complicated and more likely to cause confusion . We argued in the book instead for a radically different type of behavioural science , one which is less focused on the fallibilities of human thinking and makes more of its possibilities . Many effective interventions already work with citizen reflection and deliberation and we argue it might have been better to build on that and use a wider cognitive palate for policymakers approaching citizens . <p> We labeled this different approach ' nudge-plus ' and we argue for interventions inspired by recognizing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both lockdown and the coming out of lockdown . People are not simply passively compliant with government messaging . Many were taking steps to deal with the threat of the virus before the government 's instruction and many will decide in future what to do by reflecting on the latest , rather muddled government advice and deciding what best suits them and their families . Nudge plus relies on people understanding the messages and then adjusting their behaviour accordingly . It requires a bit of reflecting before carrying out the preferred action . Past interventions have worked when there was a one-off change that was needed , such as settling an annual tax return or promising to donate your organs . But COVID-19 requires behaviour change day after day . We need something that is going to work for months and months . <p> Citizens could have been approached in a different way . One idea is that the actions need a degree of pre-commitment . People could have been asked to commit first to the strategy , say by inviting them to pledge to stay at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as asking people to think of explaining their plans to an elderly relative before deciding what to do each day . The government has used a lot of text messages , to vulnerable groups , but would it have been possible for citizens to be able reply to a moderated website , or to discuss the measures with others living nearby if they wanted ? <p> Behavioural science has got a lot of stick in recent months , especially in the early phase of the crisis . But this should not decry the importance of governments trying to influence citizens ' behaviour rather than relying on laws and commands that are hard to enforce . Governments and citizens need to work in partnership with each other as we go through this difficult phase of trying to cope with the virus long-term and where policies to prevent widespread infection are hard to explain . Telling people what not to do is easier than advising them about what to do in the right way and in the right circumstances .

Hulsman Enterprises . He can be reached for corporate speaking and private briefings at **25;305;TOOLONG . <p> ( via Getty Images ) <p> The American astronomer , Carl Sagan , put it well : ' Where we have strong emotions , we 're liable to fool ourselves . ' To deal with this very debilitating -- if very human -- impediment , before making any definitive political risk statements , I try to blow the emotional cobwebs away by playing an invaluable game called ' What We Know . ' <p> ' What We Know ' is an effort to separate fact from fiction , to clear away the intellectual wheat from the chaff , leaving us with facts , rather than prejudices , by separating the two . The only way to do this is to see the world precisely as it is , and not how we might wish it to be . <p> And , given the obvious and proven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fateful months of December 2019-January 2020 , a game of ' What We Know ' about the brewing Sino-American Cold War is desperately called for . <p> First , we know that the pandemic did not bring about the Cold War . Long before these virulent controversies erupted , China 's piratical land grabs in the South China Sea and the Trump administration 's dissatisfaction with the established Sino-American trading regime made it clear that a major geopolitical conflict was brewing . <p> Indeed , in January 2020 , in my firm 's yearly prediction column for City AM , our very first prognostication was that the Sino-American Cold War would be the defining geopolitical feature of the new era . <p> Beneath the surface , the Cold War is driven by a series of world historical forces . There is the structural angle to things , that in a world with one primary rising power and one established great power , conflict between the two is likely , as has proven the case since Athens and Sparta over the Peloponnesian War . <p> The far more aggressive foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's earlier efforts to quietly obscure Chinese power , has also made a Cold War far more likely . <p> Whether it is Chinese encroachments in the South China and East China Seas , the gigantic , Marshall Plan-style Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) -- designed to enmesh Beijing as the dominant economic force on the pivotal Eurasian landmass -- or Xi 's very public crackdown of dissent in both Hong Kong and Xinjiang province , the combination of factors made increased tensions with Washington highly likely . <p> So this we know : A Sino-American Cold War was already on the cards , but the great controversy over the Covid-19 pandemic has set these simmering tensions alight . <p> The good news is that by every measure , the US and its western allies ought to prevail in such a contest for global power . China 's only significant would-be ally is Russia . Indeed , the only possible military challenge to the US is a far closer fusion between Moscow and Beijing . <p> But this is unlikely to happen , given that President Putin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' good Tsar , ' the embodiment of Great Russian nationalism . To play second fiddle to China ( as in any tighter alliance he must ) is anathema to both his instincts and his political power base . <p> Internally , too , China has a raft of problems , ranging from increased over-dependence on inefficient State-Owned Enterprises ( SOEs ) , to the country 's utterly disastrous ' One Child Policy . ' Put simply , due to this self-inflicted gaping demographic wound , China is likely to get old before it gets rich . <p> Yet a last ' thing that we know ' cautions us against over-confidence . While it is true China has few real friends , and a number of intractable internal problems , the US must be very careful not to fritter away its primary advantages of having the world 's most dynamic economy and being at the centre of an unparalleled alliance system . <p> Which brings us nicely to Donald Trump .

All American policy measures from here on out should use this strategic outline as our map , mitigating western weaknesses and exacerbating those of Beijing . This will be history 's yardstick of success or failure . And we must not fail . <p> City A.M. 's opinion pages are a place for thought-provoking views and debate . These views are not necessarily

Over the past few decades , New Zealand has opened itself up to all kinds of foreign influences . Gourmet food . High-tech investors . International students and visiting professors . Some of these influences are mostly benign , some not so much .

Teams or entire departments could come here , go into a mandatory quarantine and then work remotely from a safe haven . In that scenario , New Zealand would turn into a kind of home office for global business . <p> Which reminds me of a joke that my daughters keep telling because they love being here .

New Zealand will have a head start on rebuilding its economy . <p> When the German government offered repatriation flights last month , we could n't go because we had valid tickets for a commercial flight in late April .

@@41996841 <h> Asian value stocks attractive amid pandemic recovery <p> Asian businesses are gradually rebooting after governments quelled the initial wave of the coronavirus pandemic , drawing attention to equity opportunities in the region . Even before the onset of COVID-19 , Asian value stocks were trading at especially attractive levels . Now that the valuation dispersion has widened further , we believe that value stocks -- companies that are ( arguably ) inexpensive owing to a short-term controversy -- are poised to outperform once markets stabilize this year . <p> Indeed , there 's a precedent for such a move : value stocks in Asia ex Japan have outperformed in the initial stage of previous crisis-to-recovery cycles , such as after the global financial crisis in 2009 -- 2010 and after the European debt crisis in 2012 -- 2013 . And the massive amounts of fiscal stimulus being pumped into regional economies could help support cyclical companies that are more dominant among value stocks . <p> Faster Out of the Block <p> The coronavirus battle is uneven across Asia and equity benchmarks for the individual countries reflect that divergence .

And these countries still must remain vigilant to guard against a potential second wave of outbreaks that could impact economic activity and markets . <p> Easing Pandemic Pain : Telecom , Memory Chips <p> Given that progress will be bumpy , it is important to be selective . That requires homing in on specific industries and companies addressing the challenges of the coronavirus crisis . For example , to accommodate social distancing and the demand for remote work , Asian memory-chip manufacturers and telecom networks are industries that will experience robust demand , in our view . <p> Hardware memory supply had thinned even before the COVID-19 crisis .

We believe memory makers are expected to benefit from these trends . <p> In recent years , concerns about investment in 5G network upgrades weighed on network operators ' valuation , as did regulation and pressure on rates . Now , as the pandemic forces enterprises to embrace remote work , robust network connectivity and bandwidth for home offices are must-haves . That 's a blessing for leading network operators in China , especially given a relaxation of competition among Asian telcos .

@@42000441 <h> No place but home : how Covid will change the property market <h> Share <p> It took a trip to the Land of Oz to make Dorothy value her home . For the rest of us , it took a global pandemic . During the past two months , our residence -- whether that be a mortgage-free house or shared rental flat -- has become our entire world : office , restaurant , cinema , gym and shelter , all rolled into one . If we did n't know the ins and outs of our quarters before , we do now . Many people have developed a more personal understanding of a market that has played a vital role in shaping the British economy for decades . <p> Housing costs in Britain are some of the highest in the world , more than quadrupling since the 1970s . Failure to increase the UK 's housing stock over the years has made the market increasingly inaccessible to those not supported by the Bank of Mum and Dad , especially in London , where the average home carries one of the heftiest price tags in the world . <p> Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's housing market has been released from lockdown before many other industries -- it 's crucial to getting the economy moving again . At least ? 82 billion worth of property sales were frozen when the UK formally went into lockdown in March ; more than 400,000 buyers had their purchases put on hold . It would be quite a stretch to define estate agents as ' key workers ' alongside doctors and nurses , but they have been among the first people allowed back to work , even though a major part of their job involves entering people 's homes . <p> While the role of the housing sector is remarkably different in the Covid crisis than it was during the 2008/9 financial crash , it may prove equally important . A burst housing bubble accounted for roughly a third of the total fall in UK GDP at the height of the crash . We do n't yet know what hit today 's market will take , but estimates range from prices barely budging to a fall of more than 15 per cent in the value of homes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some early signs suggest prices have marginally increased : the huge drop in demand has been matched by a slump in supply , as only those in the most untenable circumstances would dare to put their house on the market right now . The UK could mirror the US -- as one of the most undersupplied countries in Europe , even the most surreal crash might fail to produce enough available homes to balance out the huge demand . <p> But early indicators suggest not . Last week when the government gave the green light for England to reopen the housing market , there was an immediate flood of homes posted online . Properties from Marylebone to Plymouth have seen their asking prices slashed . This dip is going to be followed by the biggest economic contraction of our lifetimes , possibly of the century , which will almost certainly mean another blow to the sector . Even the Bank of England -- which has been bullishly optimistic about the UK 's overall economic recovery -- has forecasted a 16 per cent dip in house prices due to the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the question , when the market rebounds , is what kind of rebalancing -- if any -- takes place between urban and rural areas , houses and flats , or different regions throughout the UK , as people reassess what features they value in their home . <p> Londoners , who once based their decisions on being at the centre of the action , now find themselves cooped up in small flats . In the past , the idea of leaving a big city would be off-putting to those who wanted easy access to restaurants , theatres and a vibrant night life . But as social distancing puts the future of many of these things up in the air , the value of a private garden is rising . Meanwhile , changes in attitudes to home-working means this is now a more realistic option for many . A trend towards suburban properties could be coming . ' London still holds its romantic appeal , ' a hopeful second-time buyer tells me , ' but it 's losing its practical one . ' <p> The benefit of living close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commute at all . Some big companies , including Google and Facebook , have told employees not to expect to come back into the office before the end of the year . Twitter has given its staff the option to work from home indefinitely . Retail and hospitality sectors wo n't be able to offer such widespread flexible working , but all companies will &gt;be staggering employees ' returns to take into account social distancing measures . And while the majority of people working from home are expected to return to the office at some point , it 's not yet clear if this will mean the same working pattern as before the lockdown : regular commuting hours , five days a week . <p> Living with Covid is n't simply a health and safety consideration , but a new factor in calculating one 's quality of life . If there is another lockdown , where will you be when it comes ? For the lucky ones , the answer might be a second home by the sea or nestled away in the countryside , but the benefits there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't necessarily be used as a safe haven when a crisis like Covid hits . The incentives now lean towards making your primary home lockdown-friendly -- by adding an extension or purchasing a second freezer , as many did in the brief stockpiling panic . It may not be ideal , but it stays within the rules . And on the plus side , there 's no risk of receiving a frosty response from locals upon arrival . <p> The real risk to the housing market is n't that it radically changes during this recession , but that when we come out the other side , it returns to being largely the same : a heavily undersupplied , restrictive sector that makes it extremely difficult for average earners to get on the housing ladder in urban areas . The government already views a functioning housing market as necessary to kickstarting the economy again ; now is the time to see it as the key to transforming it , too . A report last year from London Yimby in conjunction with the Adam Smith Institute estimated that the UK could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough homes were built in the right areas , where people want to live . As the Treasury searches for ways to pay down the countless billion pounds of debt racked up by emergency Covid measures , liberalising the planning system and building more homes is a surefire way to get the economy growing again . <p> Before Covid , many will have shared in the sentiment ' there 's no place like home ' . Now , every new buyer and renter will be thinking ' there 's no place but home ' . This will undoubtedly influence the market , but for a sector so overdue for a shake-up , it could prove a useful shift . Lockdown or not , people all over Britain should be able to aspire to live in homes that meet their wants and needs , not constantly made to reach for what 's in limited supply .

So we all hope Efendi continues on the path of recovery . " <p> ON THE EDGE <p> But as with many critical medical conditions , things had n't always run smoothly . <p> Just a few days back on Wednesday , Mr Efendi 's heart had simply stopped beating .

" I cried tears of joy . " <p> So it was tough on Mrs Sharifah that her world came crashing down again the next day , as she recalled feeling " empty " . <p> " I was moody ; I forced myself into conversations , " she said . " My kids hid their feelings well , but I knew it affected them too . It was more helpless as we were still in quarantine .

( Photo : Sharifah Radiah Ameer ) <p> " The moment that patient is on a ventilator and requiring support for his organs and blood pressure , we are concerned for the patient 's life , " he added . <p> Roughly a week into his stay in the hospital , Mr Efendi 's oxygen levels remained critically low , as doctors considered using an urgent but riskier form of ventilation known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . <p> This involves pushing a patient 's blood through a machine that adds oxygen and removes carbon dioxide before pumping it back into the body . But because this procedure requires blood thinning , it carries a significant risk of bleeding . <p> " The fact that he was considered for ECMO itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at very high risk , " Dr Monika said . <p> However , Dr Shanaz said the team eventually decided on a " more unconventional ventilation strategy " for Mr Efendi that led to significant improvements . <p> " At that point , we were sort of cautiously optimistic , " he added . " He was improving and he got to a point where his oxygen requirements had dropped significantly , they were much lower than what he initially started off with . " <p> Mrs Sharifah shares this cautious optimism , saying there 's no rush and that she just wants to see him get better . <p> " We 're all doing okay , " she said . " There is enough to keep us going for now . When he gets better and decides to retire or whatever , he has our support . Things will never be the same , but it 's a fresh start .

" <p> To leave the ICU , Dr Monika said Mr Efendi must first be taken off breathing support .

It validates what we do on a day-to-day basis . It makes the long nights and the long hours worthwhile . " <p> Mrs Sharifah said the team at the hospital has been " amazing and I am forever grateful for their efforts " . <p> " They did a great job , " she added . " I mean , it 's not easy to meet people 's expectations , to keep him alive and not disappoint his family .

For some people , this may be the only option they have at the present time . <p> The ingredients list on a popular brand of donuts reads more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . <p> The only benefit of UPFs is that their manufacturers make modest annual profits of almost $400 billion . What are the harms of UPFs ? They cause excess calorie intake by not being satiating and they induce a person to eat more quickly , enabling them to consume more food before the satiety signals of the brain engage . Does this mean that consumption of these foods contributes to obesity ? I 'm afraid it does . <p> Obesity affects all levels of society but has a disproportionate impact on lower socioeconomic groups . which includes a proportion of BAME communities already at higher risk of diabetes , and metabolic disease . UPFs cost up to 60 per cent less than unprocessed food . For some poor families , this is the difference between eating and going to bed hungry and partly explains why this group consumes more of them . <p> Are these foods addictive ? Refined sugar causes release of dopamine , a neurotransmitter associated with addictive behaviour . In fact , it may be even more addictive than cocaine . Oddly enough , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> How does one avoid UPFs ? By eating , fruit , vegetables , full-fat dairy , butter , meat , eggs , poultry , seafood , and avoiding food that comes in a box or packet with a long ingredients list . We all succumb to temptation ; I suggest that anyone who finds the desire to eat something processed overwhelming should treat themselves to the most expensive , high-quality indulgence they can afford ; the higher quality ingredients in such foods will not affect satiety levels the way UPFs have been deliberately designed to . <p> For some people this new , major change in direction , may be all they can handle under such trying times , especially essential workers &amp; parents home-schooling children . <p> When you remember that in the UK , UPFs account for 57 per cent of total energy intake and 65 per cent of the total refined sugar in the average diet this positive change alone may make a spectacular difference to both weight and health .

@@42006141 <h> Dominic Cummings ' Downing Street statement in full <p> Here is the full text of Dominic Cummings ' statement to the media during Monday 's press conference from the Downing Street rose garden : <p> Sorry I 'm late . <p> Good afternoon , thank you for coming . Yesterday I gave a full account to the Prime Minister of my actions between the 27th of March and the 14th of April , what I thought and did . <p> He has asked me to repeat that account directly to you . <p> I know that millions of people in this country are angry , thousands have died , many are angry about what they have seen in the media about my actions . I want to clear up the confusions and misunderstandings that I can . <p> In retrospect I should have made the statement earlier . <p> It 's many years since I have said anything on television , but I 'll do my best to answer questions after I 've explained what happened . <p> I also should clarify that I 'm not here to speak on behalf of the Government or the Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . <p> The Prime Minister is giving a press conference later and he will answer questions on Government policy . <p> Around midnight on Thursday the 26th of March I spoke to the Prime Minister . He told me that he tested positive for Covid . We discussed the national emergency , arrangements for Number 10 given his isolation and what I would do in Number 10 the next day . <p> The next morning I went to work as usual . I was in a succession of meetings about this emergency . <p> I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child . She told me she suddenly felt badly ill , she vomited and felt like she might pass out , and there would be nobody to look after our child . None of our usual childcare options were available . They were alone in the house . <p> After very briefly telling some officials in Number 10 what happened , I immediately left the building , ran to my car and drove home . <p> This was reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out of Number 10 . <p> After a couple of hours my wife felt a bit better , there were many critical things at work , and she urged me to return in the afternoon and I did . <p> That evening I returned home and discussed the situation with my wife . She was ill , she might have Covid though she did not have a cough or a fever . <p> At this point most of those who I work with most closely -- including the Prime Minister himself , and others who sit within 15 feet of me every day -- either had had symptoms and had returned to work , or were absent with symptoms . <p> I thought there was a distinct probability that I had already caught the disease . <p> I had a few conflicting thoughts in my mind : First , I was worried if my wife and I were both seriously ill , possibly hospitalised , there was nobody in London that we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid . My wife had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him safely a few hours earlier . <p> I was thinking : What if the same or worse happens to me ? There is nobody I can reasonably ask to help . The regulations make clear , I believe , that risks to the health of a small child were an exceptional situation and I had a way of dealing with this that minimised risk to others . <p> Second , I thought that if I did not develop symptoms then I might be able to return to work to help deal with the crisis . There were ongoing discussions about testing Government staff in order to keep people like me working rather than isolating . <p> At this point , on the Friday , advisers such as myself had not been included in a list of who were tested . But it was possible this might be changed the following week . Therefore I thought that after testing negative I could continue working . In fact this did not change and special advisers were not tested , and I have never been tested . <p> Third , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions and statements regarding Covid , in particular there were stories suggesting I had opposed lockdown and even that I did n't care about many deaths . <p> For years I have warned of the dangers of pandemics . Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning . <p> The truth is I argued for lockdown , I did not oppose it . But these stories have created a very bad atmosphere around my home . I was subject to threats of violence , people came to my house shouting threats , there were posts on social media encouraging attacks , there were many media reports on TV showing pictures of my house . I was also worried that given the severity of this emergency , this situation would get worse and I was worried about the possibility of leaving my wife and child at home all day and often into the night while I worked in Number 10 . <p> I thought the best thing to do in the circumstances was drive to an isolated cottage on my father 's farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my sister and her two children live in another , and there is a separate cottage roughly 50 metres away from either of them . <p> My tentative conclusion on the Friday evening was this : If we were both unable to look after our child , then my sister or nieces can look after him . My nieces are 17 and 20 . They are old enough to look after him but also young enough to be in the safest category , and they had extremely kindly offered to do so if needed . <p> But I thought if I do not develop symptoms and with a testing regime in place at work , I could return to work if I tested negative . In that situation I could leave my wife and child behind in a safe place -- safe in the form of support from family for shopping and emergencies , safe in the sense of being away from our home should we become a target , and also safe for everybody else because they were completely isolated on a farm and could not infect anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan Brady/PA ) <p> Contrary to some media reports , there are no neighbours in the normal sense of the word . The nearest other homes are roughly half a mile away . So in this scenario I thought they could stay there for a few weeks , I could go back to work , help colleagues , and everybody including the general public would be safe . <p> I did not ask the Prime Minister about this decision -- he was ill himself and he had huge problems to deal with . Every day I have to exercise my judgment about things like this and decide what to discuss with him . I thought I would speak to him when the situation clarified over the coming days , including whether I had symptoms and whether there were tests available . <p> Arguably this was a mistake and I understand some will say I should have spoken to the Prime Minister before deciding what to do . <p> So I drove the three of us up to Durham that night , arriving roughly at midnight . <p> I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , Saturday the 28th of March , I was in pain and clearly had Covid symptoms , including a bad headache and a serious fever . Clearly I could not return to work any time soon . <p> For a day or two we were both ill , I was in bed , my wife was ill but not ill enough that she needed emergency help . <p> I got worse , she got better . During the night of Thursday the 2nd of April , my child woke up , he threw up and had a bad fever . He was very distressed , we took medical advice which was to call 999 . <p> An ambulance was sent , they assessed my child and said he must go to hospital . I could barely stand up , my wife went with him in the ambulance , I stayed at home , he stayed the night in hospital . <p> In the morning my wife called to say that he had recovered , seemed back to normal , doctors had tested him for Covid and said they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove to the hospital , picked him up , then returned home . I did not leave the car or have any contact with anybody at any point on this short trip . <p> The hospital 's -- I do n't know what , roughly five miles or something away , two miles , three miles , four miles , something like that . <p> A few days later the hospital said he tested negative . After I started to recover , one day in the second week I tried to walk outside the house . At one point the three of us walked into woods owned by my father , next to the cottage we were staying in . Some people saw us in the woods from a distance but we had no interaction with them . We had not left the property , we were on private land . <p> By Saturday the 11th of April , I was still feeling weak and exhausted , but other than that I had no Covid symptoms . I thought I would be able to return to work the following week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation was extremely serious -- the Prime Minister had been gravely ill , colleagues were dealing with huge problems and many were ill or isolating . <p> I felt like I ought to return to work if possible , given I was now recovering , in order to relieve the intense strain at Number 10 . <p> On the Saturday I sought expert medical advice , I explained our family 's symptoms and all the timings and asked if it was safe to return to work on Monday , Tuesday , seek childcare and so on . <p> I was told that it was safe and I could return to work and seek childcare . <p> On Sunday the 12th of April , 15 days after I first displayed symptoms , I decided to return to work . My wife was very worried particularly because my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease . <p> She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child , given how ill I had been . We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town . We did not visit the castle , we did not walk around the town . We parked by a river . My wife and I discussed the situation , we agreed that I could drive safely , we should turn around and go home . <p> I felt a bit sick . We walked about 10-15 metres from the car to the riverbank nearby . We sat there for about 15 minutes . We had no interactions with anybody . <p> I felt better , we returned to the car . <p> An elderly gentleman walking nearby appeared to recognise me . My wife wished him happy Easter from a distance but we had no interaction with him . <p> We headed home . On the way home our child needed the toilet -- he was in the back seat of the car . We pulled over to the side of the road , my wife and child jumped out into the woods by the side of the road . <p> They were briefly outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit and then I got out of the car , went outside , we were briefly in the woods . <p> We saw some people at a distance but at no point did we break any social distancing rules . <p> We then got back in the car , and went home . <p> We agreed that if I continued to improve then the next day we should return to London and I would go back to work . <p> We returned to London on the evening of Monday the 13th of April , Easter Monday . I went back to work in Number 10 the next morning . <p> At no point between arriving and leaving Durham did any of the three of us enter my parents ' house , or my sister 's house . Our only exchanges were shouted conversations at a distance . My sister shopped for us and left everything outside . <p> In the last few days there have been many reports that I returned to Durham on April 13 . All these stories are false . There is a particular report that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and data on my phone prove this to be false , and local CCTV , if it exists , will also prove that I am telling the truth , that I was in London that day , I was not in Durham . <p> During this two-week period , my mother 's brother died with Covid . <p> Mr Cummings answers questions from the media ( Jonathan Brady/PA ) <p> There are media reports that this had some influence on my behaviour . These reports are false . <p> This private matter did not affect my movements . None of us saw him , none of us attended his funeral . <p> In this very complex situation I tried to exercise my judgment the best I could . <p> I believe that in all circumstances I behaved reasonably and legally , balancing the safety of my family and the extreme situation in Number 10 , and the public interest in effective government to which I could contribute . <p> I was involved in decisions affecting millions of people , and I thought I should try to help as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will argue that I should have stayed at my home in London throughout . <p> I understand these views . I know the intense hardship and sacrifice the entire country has had to go through . <p> However , I respectfully disagree . The legal rules inevitably do not cover all circumstances , including those that I found myself in . <p> I thought , and I think today , the rules including those regarding small children in extreme circumstances allowed me to exercise my judgment about the situation I found myself in , including the way that my London home had become a target , and all the complexity of the situation . <p> I accept of course there is room for reasonable disagreement about this . I also understand that some people think I should not have driven at all , anywhere . <p> But I had taken expert medical advice , it was 15 days after symptoms , I had been told I could return to work and employ childcare . <p> I think it was reasonable and sensible to take a small journey before embarking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fit state to do this . The alternative was to stay in Durham rather than going back to work and contribute to the Government 's efforts . <p> I believe I made the right judgment but I can understand that others may disagree with that . <p> Journalists sit at a distance while asking questions ( Jonathan Brady/PA ) <p> I have explained all of the above to the Prime Minister . At some point during the first week when we were both sick and in bed , I mentioned to him what I had done . <p> Unsurprisingly given the condition we were in , neither of us remember the conversation in any detail . <p> I did not make my movements public at the time , because my London home was already a target , I did not believe I was obliged to make my parents ' home and my sister 's home a target for harassment as well . <p> I understand that millions of people have seen media coverage of this issue . I know that millions of people have endured awful hardship including personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day . <p> I know the British people hate the idea of unfairness . I wanted to explain what I thought , what I did , and why over this period , because I think people like me who help to make the rules should be accountable for their actions . <p> This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation 's Editors ' Code of Practice .

Photo : AFP / Greg Baker / pool <p> Open any news website or newspaper , and you 'll find the feud between the United States and China over the Covid-19 pandemic splashed across the front . But behind these headlines is another struggle that may prove far more consequential : the battle of opposing global systems . <p> Last week , this fight was on full display during the World Health Organization 's annual meeting . On the very day that Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged US$2 billion over two years to help the WHO fight Covid-19 , US President Donald Trump was threatening to do the opposite . Without " substantive " reforms , Trump wrote in a letter posted on Twitter , American funding -- and even membership -- could vanish . <p> On one level , the rhetorical and fiscal sparring at the WHO 's expense is rooted in the domestic politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a mounting Covid-19 death toll , and Xi under scrutiny for his early handling of the crisis , both leaders are taking steps they view as necessary to support flagging legitimacy at home . <p> But on another level , the WHO tug-of-war has more to do with the two leaders ' opposing views of the international order , and of the multilateral institutions that comprise it . For more than seven decades , the alphabet soup of post-World War II global leadership -- from NATO to the WTO -- has been dominated by the US-led West . The failed response to the coronavirus crisis has demonstrated that this era is over . The question now is what will replace it . <p> The most honest answer is that no one really knows . But given that no country besides the US has the ability to reshape the global order quite like China , the best way to prognosticate is to look closely at what Beijing wants . <p> For China 's elite , one of the main complaints of the existing system is that it was built on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictated by the US . But because these values pose a threat to one-party rule , China holds a starkly different perspective on the basic responsibilities of a global superpower . <p> " Whereas the West believes that the promotion of liberal democracy can help achieve global peace and prosperity , the CCP Chinese Communist Party blames the global promotion of ' so-called universal values ' for conflict and disruption worldwide , " Nad ? ge Rolland , a senior fellow at the US National Bureau of Asian Research , wrote in testimony to Congress in March . <p> China 's preferred alternative is a global order rooted in what Rolland calls " anti-ideology " -- a system of global integration in which every country can select its own political and economic models . <p> At the heart of this vision is a China-centric world of interconnectivity , where norms set by Beijing form the basis of engagement . Unlike Washington , which applies political and social conditions to its partnerships , Beijing 's version of hegemony is agnostic . Its terms are simple : Respect China 's authority and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xi is not the first Chinese leader to advocate such a global order ; indeed , it is a tribute-like system that formed the basis of China 's imperial power for centuries . But unlike his modern predecessors , Xi has the means to deliver . For instance , the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) , which aims to link China to Africa , Europe , the Middle East and beyond via trade , infrastructure and people-to-people connectivity , is in many ways a re-creation of China 's imperial approach . <p> But in addition to the BRI , China is engaging in institution-building that is far more threatening to a liberal order . Beijing does this by working to reshape multilateral institutions from within , while at the same time building competing structures that it can influence from the start . <p> For example , in 2018 , a World Bank capital increase strengthened China 's voting rights , making it the third-most-influential member state . At the same time , however , Beijing was building its own development vehicles to spread its influence , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Development Bank and the 17+1 platform in Central and Eastern Europe . In each of these institutions , China sets the agenda . <p> To some , especially those in the Global South , a China-led international order has some appeal . At a time when the US is abdicating its global leadership role , China is doing the opposite . <p> But to supporters of liberal values and norms -- and to anyone who despises China 's trampling of basic human rights -- Beijing 's vision is parochial and even frightening . <p> Jude Blanchette , a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , says Beijing is increasingly ambitious , and that should worry the West . " That does n't have to mean that China wants to take over the globe , " Blanchette says . " But I do really think that the Party is renegotiating its role in the world , and I get very nervous when I think about that picture . " <p> Unfortunately , the options for rewriting the script are limited , especially given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China in places where Beijing 's influence is growing . While some argue only drastic measures -- like dismantling the World Trade Organization and convening a Bretton Woods 2.0 -- will salvage the liberal order , even nuanced recommendations ( such as increasing public diplomacy and focusing more research efforts on China 's strategy ) require leadership that currently does not exist . <p> Unlike during the Cold War , which divided nations into two distinct camps , the world today is too interconnected for separate rules and norms . Therefore , states that value liberalism and human rights as foundational principles must act swiftly to craft policies and economic responses that convincingly challenge China 's narrative . <p> Failing that , the war of words that Trump is so focused on will be meaningless compared with the ideological battle that China seems convinced that it can win . <h> Greg C Bruno <p> Greg C Bruno is the author of Blessings from Beijing : Inside China 's Soft-Power War on Tibet .

@@42012041 <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> TIME TO MOVE ON ? Health Secretary Matt Hancock will launch England 's all-important test and trace program this morning as ministers tell the nation it 's " time to move on " from the Dominic Cummings scandal . From 9 a.m. people will start receiving phone calls , text messages and emails asking them to self-isolate if they 've come into close contact with someone who recently tested positive for the coronavirus . Hancock is touring ( virtual ) broadcast studios right now to set out more details of the scheme , and Downing Street hopes that what should be a pivotal moment in the fight against coronavirus will be enough to push the Cummings story off the front pages for good . Tory insiders believe they have now weathered the storm after a pretty disastrous week -- and that without further developments , the anger will start to subside . <p> Day 6 : Downing Street will have been unhappy to see Boris Johnson 's refusal to launch an inquiry into Cummings ' behavior lead the BBC News at Ten last night , and variations of the story make the splash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metro and the i this morning . But crucially none of the right-leaning newspapers are now following suit , and naturally TV and radio bulletins this morning are leading with the big launch of test and trace in the coming hours . On BBC Newsnight last night ( clip here ) , Political Editor Nick Watt concluded that angry Tory MPs are conceding defeat . " The impression I 'm getting is they are very reluctantly throwing in the towel , " Watt said . One Johnson loyalist tells him the PM has " burnt up a lot of goodwill with the party and the public . " <p> Number crunching : Former Cabinet Minister Amber Rudd added her name to the list of Tory critics on ITV 's Peston show last night , saying Cummings " should quit because he 's making things worse . " She added : " People have been great during the lockdown ... and now they 're confused . And that makes them angry , and I think that 'll have consequences . " The Guardian reckons the number of Tory MPs calling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more condemning his actions . They include one senior minister -- Penny Mordaunt -- two government whips and a host of party grandees . But the rate of fresh criticism from within the party is slowing , and the threat of further ministerial resignations appears to be petering out . <p> In full agreement : Fascinatingly , it seems Labour leader Keir Starmer agrees it 's time to " move on " and talk about test and trace instead . Labour remained half in the shadows throughout this crisis , refusing to come out shrieking for Cummings to quit -- preferring to sit back and watch the Tory Party implode . Now it appears Starmer senses a willingness among the public to get back to the matter in hand . " Dominic Cummings broke the rules . It is as simple as that , " Starmer writes bluntly in a Daily Mirror op-ed . " I say to the prime minister : we can not go on like this . We can not lose another week to this farce . We need to get back on track . " Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250,000 tests a day , rather than calling for Dom 's head . It 's a very different approach to what we 've seen before . <p> Woop-woop ! That 's the sound of da police ! So it 's all eyes now on Durham Constabulary , in whose hands the fate of Britain 's second-most powerful man surely lies . The police investigation continues into Cummings ' unorthodox 90-minute " eye test " along the A-roads of County Durham , and plenty of observers in Westminster believe that if -- somehow -- the cops conclude this innocent visual inspection did in fact break lockdown rules , then it 's probably curtains for his Downing Street career . One well-connected Tory predicts dozens more MPs and even party donors would rise up in anger were Cummings to try to cling on if police concluded he broke lockdown laws . But this is Dominic Cummings we 're talking about , so who knows ? <p> Just for the record : Helpfully , Matt Hancock was asked directly by TalkRADIO 's Charlotte Ivers last night to clarify who ultimately decides whether something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas where we 've made regulations that are mandatory , there is a normal system and process in which the police police those , " Hancock said . " And then the courts system is there ultimately to make the decision . " So that 's pretty clear , at least . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Working with Enel , one of the world 's largest utility companies , Goldman Sachs structured the first bond linked to the United Nations ' Sustainable Development Goals . The bond ties Enel 's cost of capital to its strategic commitment of sustainable progress . Explore stories like these and more in our new Sustainability Report. ** <p> One other thing to watch for : The only other development that could conceivably do for Cummings now would be some new piece of evidence suggesting he did not tell the truth in his hour-long rose garden address . " I did not stop on the way " to Durham , Cummings said for example , which presumably means he had a full tank of petrol and did not need to call in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further trip outside was explained away ; every sighting of him accounted for , and as long as no one disputes it all there should be no further problem . It 's well worth listening to ( or reading -- there 's a text version ) FT legal expert David Allen Green 's lengthy walk-through of Cummings ' No. 10 statement , which he says read uncannily like a witness statement drafted by lawyers . So is the case watertight ? We 'll have to wait and see . <p> Long-term damage : Assuming Cummings is now safe , the big -- and unknowable -- question being discussed both inside and outside Downing Street is just how serious and far-reaching is the damage that 's been done . " It 's not a bubble story , but it 's not era-defining , " one supportive Tory adviser insists . " I think the media want it to be , and are in danger of over-reaching . It definitely had an impact , but do you really think we 'll be talking about this in 2024 ? I doubt it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done some damage , trust-wise , " the source says . " Cummings is used to running campaigns , where the long-term is n't an issue . But lost trust is hard to regain . He 'll be his own downfall -- now , or in a year or so . " <p> Inside government : Writing in the Spectator this morning , Katy Balls says some Cabinet ministers outside Johnson 's inner circle see an opportunity to at least bring Cummings down a peg or two . " He will struggle to command the same respect as before , or even to give orders , " one tells her , perhaps a little optimistically . Others agree . " We need to stop treating him as some high prophet rather than an adviser , " another says . Good luck with that . <p> Where did it all go wrong ? In retrospect this whole affair went badly wrong for No. 10 in the initial 24 hours after the stories first broke . An explanation that he panicked out of fear for his child ; an acceptance it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apology ; all of this would surely have been enough to dampen much of the fire . The fateful decision to come out fighting in the usual Vote Leave style -- " he is n't remotely bothered , it 's more fake news , " a " friend " briefed hacks -- backfired , enraging public , media and Tory MPs alike . And the long delay in explaining what happened -- giving the Guardian the opportunity to reveal the trip to Barnard Castle as an agenda-setting Day 2 splash -- allowed a sense of rolling crisis to envelope the whole weekend . " It 's crisis comms 101 , " one experienced spinner reflects . " You get all the info out in the first news cycle . Clearly that did n't happen . " <p> On the up : Still , the comms around this crisis feels somewhat back on track now , and Boris Johnson breezed through yesterday 's Commons liaison committee hearing without a major disaster -- read the main takeaways here from my colleagues Charlie Cooper and Emilio Casalicchio . Few of those watching were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Boris is as Boris does , and No. 10 is ( rightly ) confident that few beyond the bubble will care . Given the majority of people have better things to do on a Wednesday afternoon than watch a 90-minute Zoom chat among politicians , the handful of awkward moments ( Caroline Nokes and Stephen Timms offering up the unexpected slam-dunkers ) will no doubt be forgotten . <p> Sketchwriters ' verdict : The Evening Standard 's Joe Murphy is on superb form this morning while moonlighting as a sketchwriter , suggesting the liaison committee did not prove to be the crack outfit some had hoped . " On TV and radio , the pundits rolled the words ' liaaaaiiison committee ' over their tongues in anticipation of a skilled defenestration of the prime minister , " Murphy notes , " much as they once did about Saddam Hussein 's ' Elite Republican Guard ' in the weeks before that military force fled the field in disarray . " Ouch . The Times ' Quentin Letts was equally unimpressed . " Liaison committee : the name suggests something furtive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Len Deighton or Joan Collins . The reality ... was rather different . A buffet of bluster , a feast of froth . " <p> Alt . view:John Crace in the Guardian reckons the PM had a torrid time , however , concluding new committee Chairman Bernard Jenkin " turned out to be no patsy ... to many people 's surprise -- possibly even his own . " The Indy 's Tom Peck was unimpressed by the PM 's repeated pleas to " move on , " noting : " When Scotland 's chief medical officer was found breaking the rules of lockdown , Scotland had ' moved on ' within about nine hours . It ' moved on ' the moment the chief medical officer did the decent thing and ' moved on . ' " The Telegraph 's Michael Deacon thought Johnson sounded " weary and impatient " at the persistent questions about Cummings . Even Conservative Home 's Andrew Gimson concluded the best that could be said is the PM showed " fighting spirit " throughout . <p> Last night 's TV : A decent day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BBC Newsnight , a show they despise for its supposed liberal leanings and which they 've banned ministers from appearing on for even longer than ITV 's Good Morning Britain . Claims on social media that star presenter Emily Maitlis had been forced to step aside from last night 's show following the reprimand from BBC bosses over that dramatic opening statement on Tuesday night were flatly denied by her editor Esme Wren -- and this morning ( at 2.30 a.m. , no less ) Maitlis confirmed she had chosen to take the night off following the row . Still , Downing Street is gleeful at striking a blow -- while the Cummings-haters are livid at BBC top brass for caving in . Quite what happens if police conclude Cummings did in fact break the rules , as Maitlis asserted , is anyone 's guess . <p> Now read this:The Telegraph has another article from one of Cummings ' old acquaintances from university , the magazine editor Lebby Eyres , her third such piece inside a year . " It was always a central contradiction in Dom 's character at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously dressing as an extra from ' Reservoir Dogs , ' " she notes . " All that 's changed now is he 's swapped his Ray-Bans for a beanie . " The rose garden performance , she adds , was Cummings on his best behavior -- yet still certain traits shone through . " He spoke with the exasperated air of someone explaining a complex sum to a child , " she writes . " Dom has a knack of making people feel ever so slightly stupid when he talks to them , even if it is about his wife vomiting on the floor . " <h> TESTING , TESTING <p> BETTER LATE THAN NEVER : Eleven long weeks after the government stopped testing and contact-tracing people with COVID-like symptoms in the community , England 's much-anticipated test and trace system finally launches today . Just 10 people had died of COVID-19 when Public Health England stopped community testing back on March 12 ; today , with the launch of NHS Test and Trace two and a half months later , the official death toll is approaching 40,000 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under questioning from former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday , Boris Johnson finally stated what has been painfully obvious for weeks -- that test and trace should never have stopped , and that successive U.K. governments left Britain woefully unprepared for this type of pandemic . <p> In black and white : " We did have a test , track and trace operation in the early days , " the PM said . " But unfortunately , we did not have the capacity in Public Health England , to be absolutely blunt , we did n't have the enzymes , we did n't have the test kits , we just did n't have the volume . Nor did we have enough experienced trackers really to mount the kind of operation that they did in some other eastern Asian countries , for instance . I think the brutal reality , Jeremy , is that this country did not learn the lessons of previous corona outbreaks SARS or MERS . And we did n't have a test operation ready to go on the scale that we needed . " <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest rate of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic among countries that produce comparable data , according to excess mortality figures , " the FT reports this morning after another bleak session of data-crunching . " The U.K. has registered 59,537 more deaths than usual since the week ending March 20 , indicating that the virus has directly or indirectly killed 891 people per million . At this stage of the pandemic , that is a higher rate of death than in any country for which high-quality data exist . The absolute number of excess deaths in the U.K. is also the highest in Europe , and second only to the U.S. in global terms . " <p> Time to move on , again : The focus in Whitehall now however is on making sure the new system works , so that England can continue to unlock its economy without a second peak . Johnson had promised us a " world-beating " system in place by Monday , which was always a little optimistic patent nonsense , and yesterday his test and trace chief Dido Harding confirmed it will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn over the next few days and weeks , " she said .

" Story here via the FT . <p> How it works : The BBC has a decent explainer here , but in short anyone who develops coronavirus symptoms must self-isolate and seek a test immediately . If it comes back positive , they will be asked to provide a list of anyone they have been in close contact with for 15 minutes or more in the previous 48 hours . Those people will then in turn be contacted and asked to self-isolate for 14 days -- regardless of whether they are sick or not . Even those requiring urgent eye tests on spouse 's birthdays will be asked to stay home . <p> Are you ready ?

There were more positive signs in other state numbers , however -- Florida 's continuing claims fell by 1.6 million during the week . <p> Some economists have been hesitant to cheer the decline or say it represents a turn in the labor market .

But alas , when they turned up in the morning , the family members were all happy . Yes ! All of them that came to collect his ' dedi bodi ' were happy ! One elderly man among them said that they had been looking forward to such a day when they would be contacted to come and pick the dead body of the boy . Nobody asked how he was killed ; they were all happy that he had finally died ! <p> The Federal Government 's attitude to Gadunje and his crowd of recalcitrant elements in Kano is well understood .

Ganduje and his crowd now know that there is ' coro falafa ' -plenty coro dey . <p> The stupid behaviour of the leadership and the uninformed crowd of Kano notwithstanding , ' abandoning ' them at this time will not only be counter productive , it will make nonsense of all the good efforts of both the Federal Government and other state governments at combating the pandemic . <p> Lagos and Ekiti States , for instance , have done very wonderfully well .

That 's 8,300 to 42,000 for Canada . <p> When will we test enough to know where we are and if we are making any progress ?

@@51657741 <h> How people are passing their time during self-isolation with kooky facial hair , stick-and-poke tattoos , hair dye and more . <p> Some of us are using lockdown as an opportunity to shave our heads , beef with our flatmates or pick up smoking again ( what better way to relax during a respiratory virus pandemic than with a delicious cigarette ? ) . But as self-isolation grinds on with no end in sight , more and more people are taking the opportunity to alter their appearance in ever more creative ways . Whether this is done in a spirit of care-free experimentation or existential anguish depends entirely on the person . <p> I spoke to a bunch of people expressing their extreme psychic distress -- or simply having a laugh -- through DIY tattoos , dye jobs , facial hair and more . <h> Bleached Eyebrows <p> Sehir is a photographer for the NHS , so , unlike many of us , ca n't work from home . But she recently spent what should have been a two-week holiday in Italy stuck inside her flat , which is when her curiosity began . " I have dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face , " she says . " I 've always wondered what I would look like without them . That 's when the bleach came out . " <p> Sehir describes the reception from colleagues as mostly amusement , and was flattered to be told it looked " Bowie-esque " . " It 's quite amusing to watch people 's reactions , many of which have been why ! ? ! " <p> On the plus side , her friends and family who 've seen the new look on Zoom have all responded well , including Sehir 's mum -- which came as a pleasant surprise . As a key worker , Sehir 's life is pretty stressful at the moment , and experimenting with her appearance has helped her to unwind . " I find a sense of release in different forms of creative expression , " she says , " and that includes my style . I 've learned that the old saying about blondes is true : I 'm having fun with my bleached brows ! " <h> DIY Tattoos <p> Jemma has given herself not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one above my knee says ' softly " , ' she says . " As wet as it sounds , this is a reference to Clairo . The other one , on my wrist , ' 1945 ' , refers to the year my gran was born . I 've wanted both of these for a while but did n't feel like waiting until tattoo shops reopen . Plus , I begrudge paying over ? 60 for such small pieces of text . Using my own stick-and-poke stuff was just too tempting . " <p> Giving herself these tattoos helped make Jemma 's time under lockdown more bearable . " I 've found that being in self-isolation has given me far too much time to be in my head , overthinking absolutely anything , " she says . " But these tattoos have completely lifted my spirits in the same way I imagine more conventional ' self-care ' would . But then again , body modification has always made me happier -- so I really think it depends on who you are .

Every cheerless " virtual pub " session I 've attended so far has boasted at least one man who 's taken his lockdown beard too far and ended up looking like a cross between the Unabomber and an Amish serial killer . But for Joseph , a copywriter based in Leeds , experimenting with his facial hair was a considered decision , rather than a lethargic descent into self-neglect . <p> " I already had a bit of a stubble thing going on , but I always fancied a moustache , " he says . " Moustaches and beards always look shit during the in-between growing stage , so lockdown seemed like a perfect opportunity to cultivate a strong ' tache . Coincidentally , a few of my friends from university had the same idea , so we 've been comparing them on our weekly Zoom quiz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine is the strongest . " <p> You 'll be relieved to learn that the reaction from Joseph 's friends , family and fiance has largely been positive -- he 's been compared to everything from a New York City cop to a young Mario . " Both of those I can live with , " he says . Although Joseph is n't sure whether he 's going to keep it up after self-isolation ends , he considers the experience a positive one . " I 'd recommend growing a moustache to any man during lockdown -- even if your facial hair could be licked off by a kitten , " he says . " Turning your face into a novelty item brings a vague feeling of joy , and ultimately , no one is going to see it anyway . Crack on . " <h> Haircuts <p> Sadly , not everyone is as enthused about their lockdown makeovers as Jemma and Joseph . After giving herself a hasty DIY mullet , Carla was overcome with a feeling of profound regret . " It looks shit ! " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't mind , but when I decided to give myself the mullet I instantly realised I 'd made a mistake . I do still want one , actually -- just one that looks nice and is done by a professional . " <p> What advice does she have to stop other amateur hairdressers from following in her unfortunate footsteps ? " Do n't cut or dye your hair in quarantine unless it 's something you usually do in your everyday life . Yeah , you wo n't have to face other people with your ugly new haircut , but you can easily spend all day staring at it in the mirror . " <h> Hair Dye <p> One person who is unambiguously delighted with their new lockdown locks , however , is fashion blogger Tif ? : last week , she shaved then bleached her hair in what was a long and painful yet ultimately satisfying process . " I was just bored out of my mind , logging into Zoom , logging out of Zoom , " she says , " so I started doing other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . " <p> Changing her hairstyle came from the same desire to use her time well and not let the lockdown experience go to waste . " I thought , ' If I 'm going to be bored , I might as well do something different . If it works , it works . If it does n't , I 'm not going anywhere anyway . ' " <p> The only downside is that she likes her new aesthetic so much she regrets the fact she ca n't properly show it off : " Although , when I 'm going to the shops , I try to wear outfits that will complement my hair .

@@51666241 <p> After a nine-month saga , which began with Health Canada identifying irregularities at CannTrust , the cannabis cultivator finally filed for bankruptcy protection . The arrival of the coronavirus pandemic and its ensuing economic fallout will trigger further bankruptcies among cannabis stocks . The industry has delivered spectacular returns for investors until the bubble burst in April 2019 . <p> Leading Canadian cultivator Canopy Growth delivered a whopping 124% for shareholders between the end of April 2018 and April 2019 . Since then , it has been all downhill , because the cannabis bubble rapidly deflated . The largest marijuana ETF the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF has plunged by 66% over the last year , while its third-largest holding Canopy Growth has lost 64% . There are signs that cannabis stocks are facing a particularly bleak future . <h> Falling sales <p> The coronavirus pandemic has forced the closure of pot shops , as governments across the world shutter non-essential services . Canopy Growth was one of the first to act , temporarily closing its corporate-owned retail locations across Canada . Ontario removed cannabis dispensaries from its list of essential businesses at the start of April , forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the requirement that people stay at home for all but essential activities is weighing heavily on legal cannabis sales . <p> These events will apply considerable pressure to legal marijuana cultivators and sellers in an industry already struggling with profitability . Leading Canadian cultivator Canopy Growth posted a massive $1.8 billion loss for the nine months ending December 31 , 2019 . <h> Lower availability of credit <p> Another crucial problem , aside from a loss of sales , is that credit will become more difficult to obtain during the coronavirus crisis . That is a serious problem for an industry already battling a lack of access to capital . The stock market crash has rattled investors , making it virtually impossible for cannabis companies to raise equity . <p> Credit is drying up , as banks and other institutions brace themselves for a deluge of loan losses and credit defaults . The largest U.S. lender , JPMorgan Chase , has suspended business loans that are are n't guaranteed by the federal government . <p> Worse still , most institutions have significantly restricted their lending activities . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they prepare for an avalanche of loan defaults , spike in impaired loans , significantly higher lending loss provisions , and deluge of borrowers seeking to restructure existing facilities . That will essentially inflame an already tight funding environment . <p> The coronavirus credit crunch will prevent legal cannabis companies from accessing urgently needed capital to keep their operations afloat in an environment where sales are expected to decline sharply , placing pressure on cash flow and earnings . <h> Bankruptcies will soar <p> This will cause the bankruptcy rate to soar across an industry where many participants lack the financial resources to weather such a calamity . It is smaller participants that are the most at risk . Canada 's fifth-largest cultivator HEXO(TSX:HEXO) ( NYSE:HEXO ) is under considerable financial pressure . In its fiscal second-quarter 2020 results , HEXO flagged that it lacks enough resources to remain a going concern . The cultivator was also forced to raise $40 million in equity before the end of this month under its revised debt convents . <p> While that was a substantial amount in the current difficult operating environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That has allowed HEXO to comply with its debt covenants and fund working capital requirements . The offering was dilutive for existing shareholders and did n't raise enough funding to prevent HEXO from having to go to the markets for further capital . <p> The cultivator is experiencing regulatory issues with its Niagara growing facility . HEXO reported $266 million of writedowns and impairment charges for the fiscal second quarter . The issues responsible for those charges have yet to be fully resolved . HEXO 's precarious financial position will be impacted by additional impairment charges during 2020 , making it vulnerable to bankruptcy . <h> Looking ahead <p> Cannabis stocks are under considerable pressure . The coronavirus pandemic has magnified the issues already afflicting the legal cannabis industry . A key hazard is that capital is drying up , as financial institutions prepare for the inevitable recession and influx of loan defaults .

When sales take a hit , companies slow down clinical trials , cutting research in the short term .

The president however said it was for the good of all . <p> Although the federal government announced the palliatives , most Nigerians still called for a more inclusive arrangement that would cater for a greater number of citizens . <p> NLC 's fear <p> But in a letter dated 14th April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the NLC warned that extension of the lockdown beyond one month may spark social unrest by the citizens . <p> He said : " While we commend government for being proactive , we opine that the stimulus package would be best served through consultation with social partners .

Mass-based organisations such as labour has the grassroots presence , especially at wards and units , and can ensure that palliatives get to those who really need them -- the poorest of the poor who can not afford a meal per day . We posit that using the old platform will not deliver the desired result . <p> " The most critical need of the poorest of the poor among us is to beat hunger . Government palliatives should be tailored in a way that guarantees poor Nigerians especially daily income earners at least two daily meals . <p> " Thus , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture individual Nigerian workers who do not live with their families .

" <p> On the need to extend the current lockdown , Comrade Wabba urged the federal government to play a balancing game by also consider how Nigerians were faring . <p> " While we understand the public health imperatives for extending the lockdown in some parts of the country , it is also very important to underscore the fact that the states currently under total lockdown are the economic and administrative nerve centres of Nigeria . <p> " This is very dicey .

No one is sure how long this dam would hold .

For those who follow the news about global heating and the extinction crisis , the pandemic has added another level of despair about where the world is heading . <p> Mixed with concern about the new threat , however , is a sense of possibility . That 's because we 've seen previously unimaginable global action by governments and individuals to flatten the curve of the pandemic .

' <p> One useful way to overcome these challenges is to consider the thousands of years of history of the Indigenous Peoples in whose territories we are living . For more than 11,000 years , Indigenous settlements co-existed with intact ecosystems and a stable climate , in contrast to the fast-paced degradation unleashed in the last 150 years of European colonization of these lands , and in particular in the last 50 years . <p> After Indigenous Peoples lived for thousands of years amongst intact , ecologically rich old-growth landscapes , the vast majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecologically impoverished , even-aged stands in just a few decades .

Please note that in the same period a year ago , revenue and adjusted EBITDA contribution from SinglePlatform was $7 million and $1.6 million , respectively . The sale of SinglePlatform occurred in December 2019 . Normalizing for these numbers , revenue in the same period a year ago would have been $273.7 million and adjusted EBITDA $76.9 million . Our year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA was due mostly to increased level in investment in engineering and increased sales and marketing expenses . This was primarily offset by benefits from lower support costs . GAAP cash flow from operation in the first quarter was $34.9 million . CapEx was $11.2 million and free cash flow was $23.7 million . The year-over-year increases in cash flow from operations and free cash flow were mostly impacted by the timing of payroll in the first quarter of ' 19 , a onetime funding of a security class action settlement in the first quarter of ' 19 and no bonus payment in the first quarter of 2020 . Additionally , in the first quarter of 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to higher cash collections . <p> Slide 13 . We finished the first quarter of 2020 with 4.780 million subscribers approximately . Net subscriber additions for the first quarter were approximately 14,000 positive . We are very pleased to see another quarter of positive subscriber addition . In the first quarter of 2020 , combined avenue -- average revenue per subscriber or ARPS , was $19.01 . In web presence , it was $13.50 ; and digital marketing , $69.50 . <p> Slide 14 . We ended the first quarter with $1.713 billion in total senior debt . Including other deferred purchase obligation and capital leases of $9 million and total cash on the balance sheet of $114 million , total net debt at the end of the period was $1.608 billion . During the first quarter , we paid down approximately $8 million of the principal on our term-loan debt . Our LTM bank adjusted EBITDA for the period ended March 31 , was $310.9 million . Our senior debt leverage ratio was 4.06x and remains well below our maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 6x . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are suspending our guidance for 2020 . We will still focus on executing our original plan , but given the nature of our business , it 's still too early to assess impact of this pandemic on a customer base of approximately 5 million subscribers . As of today , demand for our product and services is consistent with our 2020 growth plan , but we 're closely monitoring the effectiveness of program marketing spend and watching our churn rate . We 're also taking a prudent financial approach and are paying very close attention to our expenses . The new CARES Act will have a positive impact on our free cash flow in 2020 . We will be able to defer to 2021 and 2022 approximately $10 million FICA taxes . In addition , we will benefit from a temporary increase in federal tax deduction from our cash interest payment in 2019 and 2020 . This will reduce our federal taxes by approximately $5 million in 2020 and also increase our NOL balance at the end of 2019 by approximately $50 million . Year-to-date , we repurchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an average price per share of $1.66 . The bulk of these purchases occurred in the first quarter . We also repurchased $3 million of high note at an average discount of approximately 5% in the first quarter . <p> We ended the quarter with $114 million of cash on the balance sheet and are managing our use of cash prudently given the end nodes . We also have access to $165 million revolving credit facility which is undrawn . We do not face any significant debt maturity in the near term . We feel very comfortable with our liquidity position at this time . <p> Thanks , Marc . I 'm proud of the work the team is doing , and we are pleased with our year-to-date results . The team is operating at scale with focus on customer value and enhancing our ability to serve more customers more effectively on a daily basis . Despite the global uncertainty , we will continue to execute our plan to grow our business by investing in sales , marketing , product and engineering on our valuable strategic brands . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , stay healthy . <p> Thank you for joining us this morning . Now I 'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&amp;A . <p> Just a couple of questions on my end . So of the 11,000 subscribers you guys added in presence , can you give us some more color on , are these customers are coming for domains ? Or what kind of attach rate you might be seeing to other offerings there ? And then some of your peers came out talking about trends and giving us an update about what they 're seeing . And it seems like there might be some kind of a pickup in new customer demand from people kind of trying to set up businesses from home and also some incremental pickup in cancellations . So just curious to know what you might be seeing on your end ? <p> So we do n't really go into the details on the first question . I think we 've tried , Naved , to be real clear that we see an expanded solution opportunity on the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HostGator and Constant Contact as the primary , and so we 're not going to separate out and start reporting on specific attach rates . We feel like that would be just too much granularity . And we would never be able to do that from an SEC or reporting perspective . Our general plan , which I was speaking about is we see the opportunity to take the units we 're bringing in and through the year continue to improve that user experience and the specificity of solutions that these users need to accomplish their objectives and whether it 's domains or hosting or e-mail marketing , our plan for the rest of the year is to keep investing to deliver additional solutions . <p> On your second question , we 're seeing the same thing . I mean the Google Search trends would tell you that short term there 's secular demand . I 've tried to keep it simple for us because we look at it , and we believe that we have a secular demand tailwind that should help us . But I think we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this health care situation plays out . And therefore , how society gets to functioning again and how things have or have not changed in terms of what 's -- of who 's going to go back in the business or how they 're going to do business . So we 're not in disagreement with anything that our peers have said . I feel like we see the same trends . And what -- I think Marc referenced , how closely we 're watching our cash , our expenses and our -- the value of the units we 're acquiring , and what 's happening within our subscriber base . And so we 're watching it very carefully . And staying focused on the investments we think are right for the long-term opportunity to grow . <p> That 's helpful . And maybe a quick follow-up . On the Constant Contact side of things , I understand it 's a slightly higher ARPS . Are you seeing greater usage for this product as businesses try to stay in touch with their customers ? Or are you seeing more pickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends to call out on that side ? <p> Yes . So we definitely have seen our platform used more , which we 're encouraged by , right ? So just a reminder , right , for those who really do n't follow the industry , e-mail marketing is a very high return on investment marketing solution . And it 's -- we 've been doing it for 20 years . We were actually -- one could argue , we were actually the first really big player training people on e-mail marketing . And so , Naved , it 's a great question . It 's a great call out . We did see the customers we have using our platform more . I mean , obviously , not all of them , but we saw very much increased usage , which is logical , given the complexity of the pandemic and how it came on and how much people needed to communicate and will need to communicate . So we 're very pleased with that . We 're glad we 've been investing in that platform . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really simple , right , which is we need to grow our net customers , and we need to grow the value those customers get over time . And those are -- I -- we 're not -- we do n't report on the difference between gross and net in any of our businesses , just to avoid the complexity of micro-disclosure for us . So we 're very pleased with the quarter we had in our e-mail marketing segment and feel like there 's a lot more we can do over time with some of the investments we 're making and intend to make . <p> This is John Byun for Brent Thill . Just want to follow-up on the previous question . Is there any other color maybe you could share on what 's going on since late March through April in terms of customer behavior , products that seem to be more in demand or we 're seeing more interest ? Anything that 's kind of different than what you had seen previously ? And then I have a follow-up . <p> So I 'll defer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks are -- I mean we think folks are using tools and have time to use these tools . And so we think this has been a net benefit for anybody that supplies anything we do , whether it 's just buying a domain , buying a domain and hooking up G Suite or Office 365 or just a lower priced e-mail-only solution , right ? We see people figuring out you really need to do these things . We 've definitely seen the mainstream folks have to get very creative with marketing , inventory management , potentially listing on multiple marketplaces . So we 're seeing a pull-forward because of the crisis , of the exploration and utilization of tools and capabilities that we provide , along with a lot of other folks , right ? So when I say secular demand , that 's what we 're describing . The specificity of it , we definitely think there 's been more demand for some things that we 're not as exposed to but it 's -- what you would hear from us is that we 're working really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a domain customer , a web hosting customer or an e-mail marketing customer . Those are our 3 primary exposures , but our whole investment strategy on our strategic brands has been to be able to take people that join us with their first purchase being one of those brands and make sure that they can do more things like e-commerce , build a website , post on Facebook or a list you integrate on Facebook , pull down their Shopify data and manage multi-marketplace listings or Ecomdash solutions . So I 'm elaborating a little bit to just make sure you know that we know where we make our money . We feel like secular demand is a good thing . We feel like we 're trying to increase , in 2020 , our exposure to things beyond just our core capabilities . And that 's our holistic strategy that we 're executing . <p> Appreciate the color there . And then just a quick follow-up on the ARPS for the web presence side that is down again . Is there any dynamic behind it ? Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends in ARPS for web presence ? <p> No . It 's the accumulated effect of some high and low value customers that are trading on legacy brands versus this or that . But we 're not managing to an ARPS number on either side of our business . We 're managing to customer success and a good return on our cost to acquire and a building lifetime revenue strategy . So we 're -- it 's a result , it 's not the number we 're managing to . We intend to grow our units -- our strategy is to grow our units , grow our revenue and grow our profitability because we feel like we have an aggregate scale , profitable exposure to growing markets .
@@51672441 <p> It 's a buzz phrase that 's been tossed around regarding mapping people 's contacts with each other using smartphones in order to be aware of those infected with COVID-19 and those with whom they have been in contact . <p> But , like much of what has been happening since pandemic restrictions were introduced worldwide , contact tracing comes with some privacy concerns . <p> While he did n't address the concept of technological tracing May 6 , Premier John Horgan did discuss contact tracing . <p> And , said B.C. Information and Privacy Commissioner Michael McEvoy , the issue has been under discussion with the Ministry of Health and provincial chief health officer Bonnie Henry . <p> " I think there may be a place for contact tracing as the province takes the next steps in addressing COVID-19 , " McEvoy told Glacier Media . <p> " Any information would be voluntarily collected , " McEvoy said . " It would only be used for one purpose and that 's for fighting COVID-19 . " <p> But , McEvoy said , if such technology is to be used , the province needs the trust of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not a magic bullet , " McEvoy stressed . " It 's just one more tool public health could use to assist in their efforts if it 's done properly . " <p> McEvoy and his federal , territorial and provincial counterparts issued a statement to Canadians on the issue May 7 , saying some apps " do not provide an effective level of protection suited to the digital environment . " <p> The use of contact tracing is not unknown in recent disease history , having been used in the early days of HIV/AIDS . <p> It did lead , though , to the purported identification of a Vancouver man , Ga ? tan Dugas , who became known but misdescribed as Patient Zero ( more from a misread of the letter ' O ' than anything ) . He was later found to be one of many people infected in the 1970s . <p> That , however , was the early 1980s and involved a lot of research and detective work . <p> In contrast , technological tools can now make light work of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being touted as a quick way to alert people about possible contact . <p> The UK , South Korea , Australia and Singapore already employ apps . <p> Indeed , McEvoy said he has been in contact with his Singapore counterpart and learned the participation rate is only about 20% . McEvoy said his research indicates a need for 50-70% of the population participating for effective traction . Further , he said , as not all people use smartphones , that number may be 60-80% . <p> Federal Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam has said contact tracing is an " absolutely critical " public health measure as Canada moves forward in confronting COVID-19 . Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has touted it as a tool while noting privacy issues must be addressed . <p> However , the Canadian Civil Liberties Association ( CCLA ) in an April 20 letter fired a shot across Trudeau 's bows . <p> While saying technology can support public health efforts , the CCLA told Trudeau , " Involuntary collection of information by governments remains unwarranted today and any requests for voluntary participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be suspended for proposed public surveillance . " <p> The CCLA said before such tools are used , certain factors must be engaged : <p> * the jurisdiction 's privacy commissioner must be engaged prior to and during implementation of any public health surveillance measures ; <p> * data collection must be grounded in evidence of public health necessity , pursuant to a chief medical officer data ' warrant ; <p> * there must be a compelling objective for the data surveillance ; <p> * an impact detriment analysis for the vulnerable must accompany any executive order , but particularly one involving surveillance , with input from human rights commissions ; <p> * a firewall must protect public health data for public health purposes from police and public order officials and data must be destroyed at the end of an emergency ; <p> * there must be a time limit on data collection ; <p> * chief public health officers and chief legal officers must appear before a legislative committee ( online or otherwise ) as witnesses for questioning by legislative members prior to the implementation of surveillance measures ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementation must exist to oversee the process , receive public complaints , provide recourse for rights infringement and regularly report to the public as to their observations and the nature and number of complaints received . <p> McEvoy said there are several models of tools available . Singapore 's , he said , is similar to those used in Alberta and Australia . Phone apps collect data from close contacts . If you test positive , a public health officer then uses the app to trace your contacts to alert them to be tested . <p> China , McEvoy said , does location tracking with its technology . <p> " That 's obviously a place nobody would want to go , " he said . <p> Another model is the Google-Apple approach where users testing positive " press a button " on their phone and it messages contacts to get tested . There , the government does n't get the information , McEvoy said . <p> Alberta using app <p> Alberta recently released the ABTraceTogether app , which the provincial government says " uses a secure , community-driven approach where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the app installed is detected nearby . No other information is shared . " <p> If a person tests positive , they would be asked who they had been in contact with in the past 21 days . If the person has the app , they would be asked to voluntarily upload the encrypted data from the app to Alberta Health Services ( AHS ) . " <p> " Once AHS receives the encrypted data , AHS contact tracers will be able to use that information to reach the other app users who have had close contact with the infected person , " a government website said . <p> The only personal data AHS collects in set-up is a user 's mobile number to allow fast contact in case of close proximity to a COVID-19 case , the website said . Geolocation data is not stored and Bluetooth log data is secure until shared . If the app is deleted , all data remains for 21 days . <p> Public Health Ontario has also been working on such a tool . <p> Early on in the pandemic , civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app use . <p> " People in Canada are concerned about the possibility of invasive emergency measures and for their potential to continue undermining our rights after the current crisis is over , " the statement said . " Even in times of crisis , mass digital surveillance tools pose a unique and insidious threat to our fundamental values . <p> " There is also a real risk that they undermine public health measures by providing a false sense of security , or undermine trust in and disclosure to public institutions . It is therefore crucial that all discussions about enhanced surveillance take place transparently and openly , before any new measures are put in place . " <p> Among those groups was B.C. 's Freedom of Information and Privacy Association ( FIPA ) . Executive director Jason Woywada said FIPA is pleased B.C. has not rushed into a contact tracing app . <p> " We have seen the implications of ' surveillance-as-solution ' thinking elsewhere and previously in our own history , " Woywada said . " We think it is important to highlight that these apps be approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consideration before implementation to ensure they are protecting people 's privacy and are not inappropriately collecting , using , disclosing or retaining information . <p> " There remains a great deal of debate on whether these surveillance apps lead to improved outcomes in comparison to more general public health awareness of relevant practises like hand washing and physical distancing . " <p> The B.C. Civil Liberties Association was also a signatory . <p> Policy director Aisha Weaver said the association is pleased with what the commissioners have produced . She said if governments allow private actors to collect data then oversight mechanisms are vital . <p> But , she said , the technology has its limitations given Bluetooth linkages might not properly reflect locations if people are on a street near a closed car , on differing sides of walls or in enclosed spaces . <p> She noted there have been calls for de-identification or anonymizing of such data , something she said adds a further complication to the equation . <p> Calgary lawyer privacy and technology Kristal Allen said such tracing is an alternative to resource-intensive manual tracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having one 's interactions with others and movements within society traced understandably gives rise to a variety of privacy and security concerns , and fears regarding intrusive surveillance . When this tracing and its component personal information collection occurs via a mobile app , privacy concerns are often heightened due to the possibility of that tracing being more extensive and closely logged or monitored . " <p> She said such systems must involve meaningful consent , minimal data usage and encryption.

@@51674041 <h> Ritz Villa , Mitchell Nursing Home spared from COVID-19 - so far <p> Sarah Williamson ( left ) , of the Ritz Lutheran Villa staff , helps resident Betty Bice with lunch April 30 . Hard work by the staff at both the Ritz Villa and the Mitchell Nursing Home have helped keep positive cases of the coronavirus out of both long-term care homes . SUBMITTED <p> Four long-term care facilities in Huron-Perth have had at least one positive case of COVID-19 as of April 30 , but thus far ( knock on wood ) , the Ritz Lutheran Villa and their satellite campus at the Mitchell Nursing Home have not been . <p> Early precautions before the coronavirus really hit coupled with hard work by diligent staff have so far been the difference , said Administrator Jeff Renaud last week . <p> " We 've been hyper-vigilant , but we 're getting tired , " he said , saying the response from the community from all sectors has been very important in boosting morale among the hard-working staff and keeping residents active . <p> " Staff have been great , everybody 's just stepped up the plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A resident at Blue Water Rest Home in Zurich is in isolation after testing positive for COVID-19 early last week , reported Dr. Miriam Klassen , Huron Perth 's medical officer of health . A staff member of Huronview in Huron East has also tested positive , while six residents and 10 staff members have tested positive at Greenwood Court in Stratford , the region 's hardest-hit facility , where four residents have died . One resident at Hillside Manor in Sebringville has also tested positive , but that case is now considered resolved . <p> The newest cases to appear in an Ontario long-term care home comes as testing ramps up in the province 's congregate care settings to include all staff and residents , whether they have symptoms or not . <p> " Our focus now is to maintain what we are seeing in the community and to protect our vulnerable residents in long-term care , " said Dr. Klassen . <p> Dr. Klassen said the resident at Blue Water was not part of the 2,000 " surveillance " tests that took place in the Huron Perth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents of the Mitchell Nursing Home were tested April 25 and all came back negative . Staff at the MNH , of which there are about 60 , were tested April 27 , with no positive results announced . The approximately 100 staff and 85 residents of the Ritz Villa were scheduled to be tested May 1 . <p> Mitchell Nursing Home is an older Class C facility , with four-bed wards in use , so the fact that no positive cases are present is good news . Older facilities , with the close proximity of residents , makes it much easier to transmit the virus . <p> " Now that we 're doing these mass swabbings , you get a resident or staff member that tests positive , they could have been coming to work for weeks without any symptoms , " Renaud said , noting that more tests mean the greater the chance for positive cases . " We 're starting to see some interesting results across the sector where we did n't expect to see . " <p> Renaud said both facilities went into immediate lockdown March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal times , and further educated staff about proper hand-washing and wearing of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . The programs team led by Leah McNain has also been instrumental in keeping the residents busy and active , from playing such things as hallway bingo to hallway hockey while showing physical distancing at the same time . <p> " Those things mattered , I think , " he said , saying staff has also been restricted to one site . Agency staff from Kitchener-Waterloo and London , usually needed to fulfill shifts , has also not been required of late , boosted a little by the early return of post-secondary students who have helped fill the void . <p> " Staffing has always been a challenge in this sector , but we 've been very fortunate . They 've all stuck with us through this and it 's certainly appreciated , " he said . <p> The fact that the leadership team has been visible through the pandemic and working seven-days a week right alongside everyone else has also helped with morale , Renaud noted , praising the Directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ritz Villa and Christina Moreno at MNH . <p> " We 've got a good team here , " he said . " Having the leadership team visibly on the floor has been tremendous , they other staff really appreciate that . We 're showing everyone that we 're in this together . " <p> The use of iPads for residents to talk to loved ones via FaceTime has gone up dramatically , along with window and balcony visits . <p> Now that the weather has improved , residents will also be able to get outside more but only within acceptable guidelines . <p> " Generally speaking the attitude is pretty good , " he said . <p> Renaud said there was an overwhelming response from the community when they found out that masks and PPE was needed , and it 's continued with various businesses randomly dropping off food or other supplies these past few weeks . <p> In the event of a positive case , isolation rooms have been built at both facilities ready for occupancy , along with enough N95 masks and other PPE . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we just tried to stay ahead of the curve , " he said . <p> In the future , Renaud can see changes made in long-term care facilities including the wearing of masks and screening of staff , residents and visitors as common practice . Currently , screens are being done at the front door from 5:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily when staff begin their shift , and again when they leave . Residents are also screened regularly . <p> " There is no end in sight . Out in the community you can say they 've reached our peak but there are more cases and more homes that are getting hit and it 's really impacting this sector really negatively , " he said . " While we think that most of society is getting back to some sort of normalcy maybe by the end of May , and we 'll start to open up the economy , you ca n't say the same thing for long-term care .

We need to start working on putting one in place . <p> by Akintola OlaniyanMay 04 , 2020 <p> You can be forgiven if you think the present administration 's failure with regards to its communication began only last Monday with that embarrassing leak of the President 's national address . True , there was substantial goodwill when that famous victory was won at the 2015 general election , and the assumption was that beating a sitting president was due to the opposition 's excellent communication before and during the campaign . <p> However , look closely , and you will find that the foundation for the chaotic communication we have witnessed since Coronavirus became an issue was laid in the deception at the heart of that campaign project . The flawed makeover that produced the opposition 's candidate was carefully managed via a network of key people in the traditional media , soi-disant political communication consultants , and slacktivists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , it was the money they made from working for the well-funded noise machine created to serve certain political interests .

In contrast to South Africa , which I am now privileged to observe at close quarters , it is obvious Nigeria lacks a comprehensive government communication policy . It would be insensitive to blame the present administration for an obvious omission that othersbefore it either failed to spot or knew how to address . However , that the arrogantly efficient noise machine that brought in this administration is failing miserably to support it now , is in itself , an irony . That the noise machine thrived at all in the way that it did is not a confirmation of or existence of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . And herein lies the tragedy of Nigeria and the chaotic communication that is visible today . While Nigeria is drifting , South Africa 's government communication policy guides all engagement at national , provincial , and local levels , and this has been obvious in the Covod-19 response.That document clearly stipulates the developmental aim of government communication , roles of political principals and spokespersons in addition to providing guided steps for every communication engagement for normal and crisis times . Such a detailed communication policy and plan leave no room for confusion and this is clear in the contrasting outcomes of the management of covid-19 . A sound policy response driven by a dedicated Coronavirus website , WhatsApp number and robust consultation with business and other levels of government have shaped the entire South African response and won it praise internationally . You are left in no doubt at all as to what the government is doing because the website and WhatsApp line are well-resourced . In addition to and possibly because it makes all information available , there are rigorous efforts to counteract fake news . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 is liable for prosecution , ' the government website warns . Thisclear messaging at all levels is in stark contrast to the confusion that is threatening to unravel the entire Covid-19 response in Nigeria . A taciturn president and a communication team which in the absence of a clear communication policy appears to be lost , are a terrible combination to have in a crisis . As all communication professionals know , the best thing you do with bad news is to make sure you provide a clear , accurate and concise message , preferably from the very top . What we have had in Nigeria is anything but . Misinformation , mixed-messaging , deliberate withholding of crucial information , have muddled up the messaging , hence the obvious failure to get Nigerians on board . <p> In the absence of the clear , accurate , and concise messaging needed in a time of crisis , their noise machine sought to fill the void with those stories about international agencies praising Nigeria for its handling of the Covid-19 response until their follies were no longer sustainable .

In contrast , South Africa hadconducted 217,250 tests and recorded confirmed cases of 5,951 , showing an infection rate of 2.7% .

Following the audio leak that suggested that he had been smuggled out of the country for treatment , there were suggestions that he was being treated in a Lagos hospital following which state officials denied being aware of his whereabouts . The handling of his infection and treatment left many questioning what was there to hide , especially when the British Prime Minister , Boris Johnson , was seen being wheeled into intensive care unit ( ICU ) following his infection with the virus . It was a missed opportunity to reassure Nigerians and get them behind the effort to fight Covid-19 .

In itself , the gathering was bad enough , but the video that caught one of the pall-bearers discarding his personal protective equipment ( PPE ) just outside the burial ground in Gudu , Abuja , was a PR disaster of significant proportion . If the government wanted to announce it was not committed to the existing lockdown and the effort to contain Covid-19 , it could not have put together a better strategy . From the statement credited to the Minister of Information , Lai Mohammed , that ' corpses can not be claimed for burial ' to the announcement by a government spokesman , Garba Shehu , that they had received the body , the message was : Do what we say , not what we do .

There have been more missteps that suggest the communication problems run deep . <p> The decision to lockdown only a few states can only be assessed when this is all over , but some of the actions suggest a lack of sound reasoning behind them . For instance , the distribution of palliatives , which was less favourable to Lagos and Ogun states as well as the conflicting signals from Kano State regarding the two-weeks lockdown announced last Monday , suggest policies are still made with little or no data .

Like all messaging since the first case was reported in Nigeria , this is another one where it is difficult to understand what is intended . Mixed-messaging like this by the administration could leave people unsure whether the government is admitting its lack of capacity to help them or whether it is simply telling Nigerians they were on their own .

@@51683741 <h> COVID-19 and the imperative of personal hygiene <p> Before the emergence of the scourge that is now tormenting the entire universe , COVID-19 , the world was disposed mainly towards pursuing curative health services . In the under-developed parts of the world in particular , very little was done towards the prevention of the numerous communicable diseases in their midst , especially in the countries of Africa and Asia . In these countries , all that was done was to encourage curative health services alone through the building of hospitals of assorted types , training medics and allied personnel , importing assorted medical equipment and drugs , manufacturing these drugs locally , sponsoring researches on different diseases , et cetera . <p> No effort was made to train those officers that usually prosecute preventive measures . Each time the politicians mounted the rostrums to canvass for votes from the electorates , they would promise to build one type of hospital and medical clinics where the people would go for the treatment of their ailments ; none of the politicians would ever mention what they would do or the structures they would put in place towards the prevention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sorry situation continued indefinitely . <p> The result was that those diseases that would have been prevented from attacking the people were allowed to hold sway in these lands and afflicted the people , maim them and , at other times , kill such people . Thus , everybody relied on curative measures alone for sustaining the health of the people . That was really bad for public health . In Nigeria , that situation was what obtained before a United States financial expert of Liberian extraction , the late Patrick Sawyer , brought Ebola disease into Nigeria while seeking a cure . When the disease came and it became clear that the only way out was to embrace preventive measures towards containing its spread among the people since it had no cure , efforts were made , for the first time in the history of the country , to remember and embrace preventive measures in containing the spread of Ebola . In that regard , Nigerians left medication and general curative measures they were used to and which was hitherto emphasised throughout the country and embraced prevention ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very simple ) acts of regular hand-washing with soap , controlled sneezing and coughing , social distancing at events , having two thorough baths every day with soap that should last for at least 120 seconds during each bath , avoiding over-crowding , living in properly ventilated apartments , avoiding contact with body secretions , filing finger and toe nails low always to prevent them from harbouring dirt , germs and lower animals in them , and similar preventive measures were all that the people of Nigeria were required to do to save themselves from Ebola then , as many viral diseases usually did not respond to conventional treatments . <p> Today , these very simple acts of personal hygiene and environmental cleanliness that nearly everybody had relegated to the background before the Ebola era of 2014 are what every Nigerian is compulsorily required to observe , carry out and undertake in order to save themselves from the global scourge that is called coronavirus that is currently tormenting mankind and sending thousands of the people of all climes to their graves ! So , today , the neglected , degraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our midst towards saving mankind , and which goes ahead to actualise the old but neglected clich ? which says that , ' Prevention is better than a cure . ' This is the triumph of personal hygiene aspects and general preventive measures over a cure ! Prevention now holds sway for the first time in Nigeria , where the people had been brainwashed and made to believe that their total reliance on curing communicable diseases was all they needed to do to be healthy . This is obviously false and misleading . Health education teaches and assures us that some of our actions and deeds could help us maintain and sustain our individual health and public health in general . This is why it is taught in public health that the health of one man is the health of all . <p> Today , the people have realized that there are minor , simple and , indeed , very effective preventive measures they can undertake and do on their own to stay away from contracting many communicable diseases instead of contracting such diseases and trying to cure same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people now realize that a majority of the diseases in their midst are no longer treatable and curable , including the dreaded COVID-19 and many other viral diseases , hence they need to embrace preventing the diseases they could prevent through their own efforts , actions and deeds . It is interesting to note that these preventive measures are not only available as we can do them on our own , but they are cheap and affordable , and can be undertaken everywhere whether we are formally educated at any level or not . <p> So , through the simple act of observance of personal hygiene aspects , Ebola disease spread was , in particular , contained and stopped from spreading in the country in 2014 ; it was not stopped by those who treated diseases but through the easy acts of avoiding handshakes and body contacts , application of hand sanitizers , and rehydrating the body through drinking portable water at intervals ; avoiding over-crowding always , ensuring that our dwelling places are properly ventilated and fly-proofed among those listed before now , and similar ' minor ' preventive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple hygiene rules , Ebola was removed from Nigeria . <p> As the people of the world battle COVID-19 and seek an end to the existence of this pandemic that has already had a devastating effect on the people of the world , it becomes imperative that all those who relegate preventive measures should have a rethink now and realize that as we do all to cure communicable diseases in our midst , we must do anything we can also to encourage the prevention of these communicable diseases in our midst . Ebola , Lassa fever and now , coronavirus , have clearly shown that we should not continue to rely on curative health services alone and expect to be free from diseases in the world . <p> In this sphere , our Port Health Services must never be neglected again . <p> This means that the right calibres health professionals must man our sea and air ports effectively the way they should be manned , and the health activities in these ports not politicised the way environmental sanitation services have been dangerously politicised in the various states today to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the different categories of health professionals must be discouraged .

" <p> It seemed inevitable from the start , but it took a while for the Quebec government to finally admit it : Montreal 's schools are in no position to reopen until September . The decision was made this week , as the scale of the COVID-19 problem in Quebec -- which we wrote about for iPolitics last week -- garnered attention in national and international media , and Montreal emerged as a global coronavirus hotspot . <p> With Quebec now accounting for more than 60 per cent of coronavirus deaths in Canada , and approaching France 's per capita death toll , has the Legault government finally started to own up to the extent of the province 's COVID-19 morass ? <p> The dire situation in Quebec seemed to register as a wake-up call for Quebec Premier Fran ? ois Legault this week .

More tests were promised , particularly in the hardest hit areas like the Montreal borough of Montr ? al-Nord , where infection rates are now on par with New York City 's Brooklyn borough . <p> Remarkably , the Premier highlighted this new concern by staging his first official appearance in Montreal this week . Since the start of the pandemic , he 'd given his regular briefings from the safe distance of Quebec City . That fact alone is startling . Imagine New York State governor Andrew Cuomo leading his response to the coronavirus epidemic from the sleepy administrative capital of Albany , while New York City suffered thousands of deaths . <p> From the outset of the crisis , Legault 's message has been full of nationalist boosterism -- promising that with Quebec solidarity and resourcefulness , along with some social distancing , sunny days would soon return .

But those who were expecting a sudden display of political accountability were sorely disappointed . <p> Legault 's actions have been motivated not only by the facts on the ground , but by the political blowback he has faced since last weekend . Catastrophic epidemiological modelling scenarios were quietly published online by the province 's independent Institute of Public Health last Friday afternoon , without any accompanying announcement or explanation by the Premier or his team . <p> The models ominously predicted a possible 150 deaths per day in Montreal by July if social distancing measures were relaxed . Media were left to break the news to a stunned public -- as leadership was nowhere to be seen . Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , himself a Montreal MP , expressed concern at the grave situation as everyone waited for the Legault government to respond . <p> After two long days of silence , Legault tried to dismiss the significance of the projections , insisting they only confirmed what the government had planned to do all along .

That 's because he thought the models would " be interpreted as what is actually going to happen " and he feared " making people nervous " . <p> Of course , models are hypothetical by nature , so failing to talk about them because they do n't represent a guaranteed outcome is a bizarre rationalization . Furthermore , governments everywhere use such models to inform public policy . They may be theoretical , but their importance is tremendous . <p> Is it possible Arruda demurred because he did n't want to end the week 's news cycle on a sour note ?

@@51693041 <h> Why the market can not be trusted to develop a vaccine <p> In this picture taken on April 29 , 2020 , an engineer shows an experimental vaccine for the COVID-19 coronavirus that was tested at the Quality Control Laboratory at the Sinovac Biotech facilities in Beijing . - Sinovac Biotech , which is conducting one of the four clinical trials that have been authorised in China , has claimed great progress in its research and promising results among monkeys . ( Photo by NICOLAS ASFOURI / AFP ) / TO GO WITH **26;1893;TOOLONG , FOCUS by Patrick Baert ( Photo by NICOLAS ASFOURI/AFP via Getty Images ) <p> By Abrahim Zaka <p> Are there enough incentives for firms to develop a vaccine for Covid-19 ? On the face of it , I should n't even be asking this question . When demand for a vaccine far outstrips supply , it makes good economic sense to produce such a vaccine . Margins on products would be high and shareholders will be content with their dividend . Then why do n't we have a vaccine for diseases such as SARS or Ebola yet ? <p> It 's important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine markets to answer this question . Drugs are less complex to produce than vaccines , relatively easier to produce generic versions , and the end product is offered great protection by patents and are largely propelled by market force of demand . <p> Vaccines , on the other hand , are relatively more complex to produce , and often the process of production is patented rather than the end product , and it is largely propelled by government or institutional incentives . So why do n't we have a vaccine for SARS or Ebola ? Primarily because government interest faded out once the pandemics were under control . Vaccine development needs a long-term commitment from governments , otherwise , economically , for firms , it is not attractive to produce the vaccine . Given that 90% of the world 's vaccines are produced by only 15 firms that are publicly listed on the stock exchange , their shareholders concerns have to be catered to . <p> Significant issues revolve around patents and copyrights . Take the case of Gilead , a pharmaceutical company listed on the NASDAQ developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to produce results for Ebola patients , it has been promising in some clinical trials on Covid-19 patients . But institutes around the world have applied for multiple copyrights on the same drug . Arguably , why should firms like Gilead develop drugs if their patents are not guaranteed ? Likewise , why would pharmaceutical firms endeavour to develop a vaccine if governments do not see the effort through to fruition by continued support ? In the case of SARS , that is exactly what happened when governments withdrew their support after the pandemic had died down . <p> But if so much government support is required , then why grant the firms patents over the vaccine development process ? Indeed , granting of a copyright is akin to granting a monopoly to a firm for producing a vaccine . From a pharmaceutical firm 's perspective , this is fabulous as they can rake in abnormal profits without competition . Consider Sanofi , in 2018 about 17% of their Q4 global sales revenue came from vaccine sales . <p> Given that the global vaccine market is worth multibillions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their shareholders , therefore , patents are always welcomed by them . But the counter argument to this is that patents put vaccines beyond the reach of the developing nations , despite subsidy programs such as Gavi launched by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the World Bank Group and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation . <p> Moreover , pharmaceutical firms tend to misuse government incentives and legislation to maximise profits which critics argue is not the case for incentives . Consider the case of the orphan drug legislation passed in the United States in 1983 . The fundamental aim of such legislation was to ensure that pharmaceutical companies produce drugs for rare diseases that effect less than 200,000 people . If pharmaceutical firms produced these drugs , they would get a seven year monopoly over manufacturing the drug as the FDA would not grant any other permission for similar drugs to be launched in the market place , even if the original patent had expired during that period . <p> However , an analysis has shown that about a third of the orphan drug statuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illnesses , and were later prescribed as a treatment for rare illnesses , thereby granting the companies the orphan drug status . Such loopholes are defeating the original purpose of the legislation and earning the pharmaceutical companies billions through monopolies . <p> Hence , there are many who are skeptical of providing pharmaceutical companies additional incentives . Stiglitz et al . ( 2020 ) recently argued for abolishing the current system based on maximising profits and granting monopolies by introducing a new mechanism or widening an existing mechanism such as the existing patent pooling system . Hence , patents holders grant licences and in developing countries the drugs are produced for lower costs as is done by the medicines patent pool ( " Our Model -- MPP , " n.d . ) . <p> The generic competition drives prices down to the benefit of end consumers . But all these ideas also fundamentally challenge the ideas taught around the world in business schools . Primarily of value creation and maximising shareholder value . Moreover , can free enterprise and innovation thrive in markets where the winner does not take all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medicines patent pool only has seven pharmaceutical companies that have granted their licences for only three diseases namely , HIV , Hepatitis C and Tuberculosis ( " Products Licensed -- MPP , " n.d . ) . In the current form , it seems rather farfetched that pharmaceutical firms would take such a decision with ease and if it were through government intervention that such firms business model was changed risks eroding these firm 's competitiveness . <p> But this is not to say the current aim of creating shareholder value that drives most pharmaceutical businesses is not without flaws . Consider the practice of share buybacks . Companies argue that by buying back shares they are reducing the number of outstanding shares in the market , and thereby , improving their shareholder value as the earnings will be distributed over fewer shareholders . Moreover , shareholder value increases through capital gains which is more efficient means of rewarding shareholders than a dividend pay-out . Merck the global pharmaceutical giant spent 16 billion dollars on share buy backs in 2018 , whereas they only spent 10 billion dollars on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in research and development is a better way of creating shareholder value than share buybacks . However , reality is different . <p> There is no easy solution to the economic and market problems of creating a vaccine for Covid-19 . Radically changing business models , government support and corporate capitalism all feed in to the problem . But they in tandem also are providing solutions . This is the nature of markets muddled and imperfect , and we need to make the best of what we have . <p> Dr. M.A.Zaka is an academic with an interest in business , new technology and economics . <h> 1 COMMENT <p> Grateful Dr. Zaka to your valuable contribution/sincerity .

@@51698641 <h> COVID-19 and Nigerian Banks , By Reuben Abati <p> Before COVID-19 , one of the problems Nigerian banks faced was that of over-regulation by the Central Bank . Regulatory high-handedness hampered the capacity of the banks . Many of the banks also faced the threat of deteriorating credit quality due to over-exposure , particularly to ailing sectors -- oil and gas and the power companies . COVID-19 , collapsing oil prices and naira devaluation turned the crisis in the banking sector into a triple whammy . <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the entire world -- the future of everything and the world of work , but perhaps the most visible effect of this disruption is most felt in the financial services sector , the markets and the global economy . In this regard , the banking sector is one of the most gravely impacted . It would be useful to reflect a little on the extent to which this is so in Nigeria and the meaning of the multi-dimensional implications , and hopefully , someday , someone will take on the task of analysing , in greater detail , bank-customer relations and the role of the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek to provide a preliminary sketch , throw up a few posers and make some observations . <p> When on March 29 , Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari announced the imposition of an initial two-week lockdown on Lagos and Ogun States and the Federal Capital Territory , the three parts of the country that had then presented a higher COVID-19 sero-prevalence , he exempted healthcare workers , security personnel , pharmaceutical companies , oil company workers , the country 's food supply chain , the media , and other essential workers . His speech made no mention of the banks . <p> This omission was addressed the following day , March 30 , by the minister of Finance , Budget and National Planning and the governor of the Central Bank , who further informed the public that Nigerian banks/money markets would also be expected to provide essential services during the period of the lockdown . Obviously , during the period , Nigerians would need money , either in terms of access to cash or the completion of pending transactions , transfers , payments and savings . In April , the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet by another week , towards the end of the month . As it turned out , other states of the federation relying on Section 8 of the Quarantine Act and enabling state laws also enforced their own versions of the lockdown . Effectively , Nigeria became part of the global response to COVID-19 . People were asked to stay at home , stay safe , follow guidelines , and avoid the risk of infection and transmission . It all happened so suddenly , so unexpectedly . Nobody was prepared for it . There were reports of harvests of death in Europe , Asia , and the Americas . Fear gripped the world . Panic reigned . People asked the inevitable question : Will humanity survive , given the virulence of the virus ? As people stayed at home and off the streets , they still needed to survive . Nobody had withdrawn cash or saved towards emergencies such as COVID-19 . The importance of access to the banks and to cash was writ large ; earning an income became a matter of life and death for households and businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in which only the fittest survived . The banks in Nigeria were not of much help . Their rating in terms of customer relations/support fell . <p> The banks simply refused to open their doors to customers . The few that pretended to do so in Lagos provided only skeletal services . People were advised to make withdrawals using Automated Teller Machines ( ATMs ) , but most of these machines had no cash supply , and where they had , long queues could be seen daily , without anyone observing the physical distancing guidelines . Digital banking transactions , which has been touted as the new way of the world , proved difficult . If you went directly to an open branch , you would be kept waiting by a gateman who knew nothing about banking . He would return later to tell you that the officer hidden inside the banking hall would need to contact someone at the headquarters . Many account officers who attended to the middle class were also under quarantine . Their phones were switched off . A major pillar of the banking business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took their own survival more seriously . The customer was no longer king ! COVID-19 is the great destroyer of all known norms . It has shifted paradigms and turned the table against all known norms . <p> When on one occasion , I had cause to protest , I was told that the banks were also being careful . They needed to protect their staff . They would not allow customers to bring the virus into their banking halls . They had also recorded quite a few cases of fraud during the lockdown . So does that justify the scarcity of cash at cash points and the epileptic e-banking platforms ? It will be recalled that the Central Bank of Nigeria introduced a Financial Inclusion Strategy in 2016 , the objective of which was to promote electronic banking and mobile money transactions . This led to the increasing digitalisation of banking transactions in the country and the emergence of such features as the use of POS , e-banking and payment service agents . Whereas this has been hailed as a progressive development , Nigeria remains far behind other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of financial inclusion has been recorded . Nigeria 's slow penetration rate in this regard was exposed by the COVID-19 lockdown and indeed in reality , Nigeria remains under-banked ; its banking practices are still far behind . <p> But even then , bank customers are still unhappy , particularly in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory . The banks remain an index of the people 's frustration . From May 4 till date , the premises of virtually every bank has been a war zone . Customers besiege the banks daily , without caring about either physical or social distancing rules . They sit outside or they queue up in a long , snaky stretch . <p> For many subsistence workers whose survival depends on daily work , the banking situation was worse because these blue-collar workers live or suffer , relative to their daily hustle . Whatever work that linked them to the banking value-added chain was cut off . The extended family community that often helps to bridge the gap in Africa , was also adversely affected . Nigerians in Diaspora whose financial remittances constitute a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also ran into troubled waters . In every sense , Nigeria 's financial sector faced a severe respiratory crisis , with corresponding implications for economic growth and social stability . It did n't take long before Nigerians , especially the youth , became restive . A social crisis loomed large in the horizon . In Lagos and Ogun States , neighbourhoods were attacked by those who called themselves " One Million Boys " . The rich became afraid of their own shadows . Nigerian banks had to take extra security measures . Organised labour and the organised private sector began to push the argument that the lockdown would not work in Africa , and that it was better government re-opened the business space . <p> On April 27 , it may be said that the federal government succumbed to pressure , when in a nationwide broadcast , President Muhammadu Buhari announced a " phased and gradual " easing of the lockdown in the Federal Capital Territory , Ogun and Lagos States , with the same advice for other parts of the federation , subject to their own peculiar circumstances with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State chose to defer its own relaxation of the lockdown by a week , having joined a week later than the FCT and Lagos State . On May 17 , the State announced yet a further extension of the lockdown . Other states of the federation again took their cue from the federal government in due course . Delta , Ebonyi , Katsina , and Borno states have since allowed mosques and churches to re-open . Kaduna State and others have also announced relaxed measures . Across the country , a curfew remains in place from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m . Inter-state travel has been banned , even if there are concerns about the movement of the almajirai across state borders , with many of them testing positive for COVID-19 . In the face of new guidelines , banks also opened their doors . <p> But even then , bank customers are still unhappy , particularly in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory . The banks remain an index of the people 's frustration . From May 4 till date , the premises of virtually every bank has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without caring about either physical or social distancing rules . They sit outside or they queue up in a long , snaky stretch . The people seem determined to die , if possible , just to gain access to their bank accounts . The queues are long . The desperation is palpable . A few banks have since provided tents and chairs in front of their branches . I wo n't be surprised if in the third week of the easing of the lockdown , some Nigerian banks also begin to provide mattresses and mats ! Those queues may not disappear unless the banks open up more branches and pay better attention to customer care . <p> Just how serious this is , was brought to the fore in a now popular and sensational video , showing the chairman of Ikwerre Local Government in Rivers State , Samuel Nwanosike , who led a mini-task force to a branch of the United Bank for Africa ( UBA ) to disperse a crowd of bank customers , who did not wear face masks , and did not observe physical or social distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , Nwanosike asked the bank officials , angrily . " Who is the bank manager here ? ... Who is the second in command ? " One bank official told him : " The people are not listening to us " . There may be a lot to learn from this as all businesses adjust to a " new normal " , occasioned by a capricious virus . <p> The banks and their sympathisers insist , however , that they do not deserve any blame , vulnerable as they are , like every other business , without any measurable support from either government or their regulator , and yet they continue to play their part as responsible corporate citizens . There is probably a point here : It is on record that the banks and their CEOs enthusiastically joined the Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19 , known as CA-COVID , which has so far raised over N27 billion . It is part of the burden that banks face that many of their customers think that the donations should have been given to them directly , since the banks have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of seeking tax reliefs , and their CEOs , of promoting their own individual egos . <p> The plug on job cuts , or the furloughing of bank staff is at best the postponement of the evil day . Bank staff , as well as other employees , must prepare for the worst . Many businesses will end up as part of the COVID-19 death rate statistics . Jobs will die too . Previous pandemics posted a V-shaped recovery trajectory . There are no such guarantees this time around . <p> But perhaps the biggest challenge for Nigerian banks , and the extent of their vulnerability , emerged when a tele-conference video was leaked , showing the CEO of Access Bank , Herbert Wigwe , in which he announced that Access Bank was going to cut staff salaries and retrench staff as part of its business continuity and sustainability plans in the context of a public health crisis that has crippled business . The leakage of the Access Bank video was met with outrage . Wigwe was called names . The Bank was abused . A few days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama , announced that no bank is allowed to cut any job without its express approval , and that indeed job cuts in the banking sector are forbidden at this time . Access Bank denied the video that was in circulation . Stakeholders may accuse Nigerian banks of lapses in the face of COVID-19 but the truth is that the attack on Wigwe and Access Bank was totally unwarranted . In my view , Wigwe showed leadership and was honest . <p> The only " COVI-diot " in the Access Bank matter is the disloyal staff who leaked the content of an in-house conversation . No serious organisation should condone that kind of treachery . Wigwe says salaries will be cut and branches will be rationalised . Last year , Access Bank acquired Diamond Bank in one of the biggest merger and acquisitions that the Nigerian banking sector has witnessed in the past decade . Since that merger , Access Bank has not rationalised staff or branch networks . It simply inherited all the branches and staff that belonged to the defunct Diamond Bank , resulting in a situation where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank on the same street . Access Bank may have chosen the wrong time to announce its business re-design plan , but it is confronted with a reality that every business would have to deal with . But the question should be asked : Is it part of the work of the regulator to dictate cost and business models ? <p> Before COVID-19 , one of the problems Nigerian banks faced was that of over-regulation by the Central Bank . Regulatory high-handedness hampered the capacity of the banks . Many of the banks also faced the threat of deteriorating credit quality due to over-exposure , particularly to ailing sectors -- oil and gas and the power companies . COVID-19 , collapsing oil prices and naira devaluation turned the crisis in the banking sector into a triple whammy . Micro-finance banks are losing over N45 billion uncollected loans . To all intents and purposes , it is part of the role of the Central bank to protect the banks and stave off the possibility of corrosive stress . Elsewhere we have seen central banks intervening to protect the banking sector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other areas -- to protect SMEs , pharmaceuticals , loans , the manufacturing sector , agriculture , but it has done little to strengthen the capacity of banks to survive as businesses . <p> The plug on job cuts , or the furloughing of bank staff is at best the postponement of the evil day . Bank staff , as well as other employees , must prepare for the worst . Many businesses will end up as part of the COVID-19 death rate statistics . Jobs will die too . Previous pandemics posted a V-shaped recovery trajectory . There are no such guarantees this time around . A U-shaped recovery scenario may even be optimistic . Many economies will sink in an L-shaped format . And that is where leadership matters . What should leaders do in relation to economic risks and the structural legacy of COVID-19 ? This is the kind of rigorous thinking we need to see , instead of the same government that wants to implement the Oronsaye Report , cut cost and ensure economic sustainability , telling banks and other businesses that they can not cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management of the COVID-19 tragedy so far points to serious issues of governance .

@@51699041 <h> Almajiri and violation of lockdown order <p> AS a rule , pandemics put social and political relations of the affected society under a magnifying glass , and Covid-19 has been no different . In Nigeria , it has revivified knotty social questions around unemployment , education , and youth alienation , the Almajiri conundrum being a perfect encapsulation . <p> On paper , the Almajiri phenomenon is a win-win for all concerned . It goes like this : a parent willfully hands over their child or ward to an Islamic scholar , with the understanding that the scholar , typically a local Imam or suchlike authority that is well-versed in the Quran and the Hadith , would be responsible for the religious and moral instruction of the pupil . The spiritual authority gains a supervisee , someone who , in theory , acquires enough knowledge to train the next generation ; the parent , at least tentatively , is relieved of care for the child , while the society gains a properly groomed and morally grounded citizen . The economics of the arrangement tend to be unspecified , since , at any rate , the local spiritual trainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his upkeep . <p> That this is not the way things have panned out across northern Nigeria , where the tradition has taken root over the past several decades , goes without saying . Negating the basic idea , overwhelmed parents more or less hand over the care of their children to Islamic scholars who , because they enjoy increasingly scanty social prestige , can no longer count on the generosity of their immediate community . As a result , in order to make ends meet , both for themselves and their unlucky trainees , the latter are basically forced onto the streets , where , in an ugly sight witnessed daily across many Northern Nigerian cities , they harass ordinary citizens for food and money . <p> All of which is to say that Almajiri is a perfect illustration of what happens when a well-intended social programme goes awry , and before the outbreak of Covid-19 , there were encouraging signals that northern governors were ready to rein in the problem . If that is the case , the approach adopted by some of them -- essentially , round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back to their states of origin -- is proof that the problem is misunderstood . So far , the governors of Jigawa and Kaduna states respectively have followed in the footsteps of Kano State governor , Umar Ganduje , who made the initial move of repatriating more than 1,000 Almajiris to their respective states . <p> Which raises a very interesting question : who owns the Almajiri kids ? Surely , it can not be the states to which they have been deported since , technically , a state can not own a child , and no state was responsible for the transfer of the young men and women to their respective Islamic tutors in the first instance . Therefore , why transfer the Almajiri to those states ? We are arguing here that , while they should be applauded in their well-meaning desire to curtail the spread of Covid-19 among such an eminently vulnerable population , the individual governors sabotaged their own efforts by not asking about the parents of the Almajiri , since , first and foremost , they were the ones who engaged in a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . Else , how did those children make the journey from their respective states of origin to their places of apprenticeship ? <p> This is the same categorical error that Shettima Yerima , President of the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum , made in his intervention , in which he warned southeastern governors against rejecting Almajiris deported from northern states . Rather than ask why there are many homeless kids roaming the streets of northern Nigeria , and why , crucially , a private programme of religious apprenticeship appears to have unraveled at the seams , Mr. Yerima doubled down on a specious debate about the right to freedom of movement which no intelligent person contends . <p> Covid-19 or not , the Almajiri problem is one that northern states can not hope to deport their way out of . It is a multifaceted problem with various religious , cultural , pastoral , and other dimensions . It does require more thought and deliberation than it is being accorded at the moment . <p> COVID-19 : Buhari May Announce New Policy Monday President Muhammadu Buhari may on Monday announce new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Many clients remain hesitant , concerned over health risks or squeezed financially by the pandemic . Bringing employees back is also proving a challenge , with less work to go around , and school closures keeping many at home caring for their children . <p> Louisa Posthumus , owner of Executive Cleaning , said she welcomed Premier Doug Ford 's announcement last Thursday that cleaning services could reopen , but it would likely be weeks before her company will be back in clients ' homes . <p> Most employees were hesitant to return until full-time hours were available , she said , especially since working part-time would net less than the $2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building full-time schedules is proving difficult -- while some clients were eager to resume services , many others are n't there yet . <p> " There 's a lot of people who are still very , very reluctant , " Posthumus said . <p> She 's now reaching out to clients to determine when there 's enough interest to restart . <p> " If I can get enough people on the list , then I can rehire and we can start up again . " <p> Joni Pike , the owner of Maid For You Cleaning , said it 's simply too soon . While she 's feeling the financial pressures of a months-long closure , many of her staff and clients are not ready . <p> " I have a lot of staff who are babysitting grandchildren , taking care of elderly parents , " she said .

For a growing number of consumers , it had become old and boring , and more people were hesitant to trust what was happening in the dairy sector . <p> Farming communities were clearly not ready for the new attitudes and values shared by many urban consumers . <p> Animal activists and environmentalists were gaining on the industry , which could provide little in the way of response to their arguments . <p> Authenticity and wholesomeness were the public relations weapons of choice for the dairy industry . Still , momentum was not on the sector 's side -- until COVID-19 showed up . <p> COVID-19 hit quickly and quite violently . Many of us simply lost our psychological and rational bearings and got into a survival funk . The result was panic buying , lineups and a genuine distrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food we would need for some time . For days , even weeks , many felt genuinely food insecure -- and all of this in one of the richest countries in the world . It 's a notion that was considered impossible just a few weeks earlier . <p> As we end the first phase of our long , slow march towards normalcy , we can see that things have changed dramatically . Our food vocabulary has completely changed over just a few weeks . Conversations about plant-based products , veganism , animal welfare and sustainability have swiftly been replaced by discussions about supply chains , empty shelves , flour , yeast and eggs . <p> Fear is one of the most powerful feelings a human can experience . As we were confined to our homes , we were all forced by fear to go back to basics . <p> You could argue that Canadians have never cooked this much since the end of the Second World War . Our relationships with our kitchens , the true heart of the home , have grown stronger . <p> According to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of the people polled plan to make more home-cooked meals after the virus passes . It likely wo n't be that high but it certainly will be more than 10 per cent . <p> We 're creatures of habit and given how long the lockdown has lasted , COVID-19 's legacy will be about how it forever changed the way we relate to food . In other words , some of our new habits will remain . <p> With a powerful combination of providing comfort and promoting good health , milk and dairy products will be found in the middle of all these changes . With its marvellous fusion between animal and vegetable , and given its unparalleled natural integrity and voice , milk always finds a way into recipes and beverages for many diets . <p> What 's more , as has been demonstrated several times in health research , a sedentary lifestyle will get people to consume more dairy products , eventually . <p> With most restaurants closed , overall demand for milk is down , so numbers are n't encouraging right now . But sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy at home . <p> With stay-cations expected to be more popular over the next little while , dairy consumption at home will also push sales in the foodservice industry over time . <p> And coming out of COVID-19 , dairy farmers will likely have more direct access to consumers . According to a recent poll , 22 per cent of Canadians intend to shop online more often after the crisis . <p> So COVID-19 could democratize the supply chain . Once online buying for food purchases exists in consumers ' minds , anything is possible . We 're already seeing groups of farmers engaging with consumers online since a void has been created by grocers who have been overwhelmed by demand . <p> And farmers will charge a premium , because they can . <p> COVID-19 is exactly what the dairy industry needed , even though the virus has created havoc in our daily lives -- and far worse for those who contracted it . <p> Sustainability , plant-based protein and all other spending trends we saw in food before COVID-19 will eventually bounce back .

It would address the workforce shortages . Above all , it would help keep the public safe . <p> By Laura Bulmer May 21 , 2020 <p> A personal support worker knocks on a resident 's door at Toronto 's May Robinson apartments , part of TCHC seniors housing , in Toronto , on Friday April 17 2020 . THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young <p> Laura Bulmer is a PSW advocate , registered nurse and professor at George Brown College in Toronto . <p> Before COVID-19 , we did not have enough personal support workers in Canada . This life-threatening shortage is the result of long-ignored retention and recruitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personal Support Worker Association , a 2017 survey of PSWs revealed the workforce is diminishing at an alarming rate of 30 per cent quarterly . Those surveyed identified factors such as low pay ( ranging from $15-23 per hour depending on the setting and whether it receives government funding ) , working short-staffed , safety concerns , compassion fatigue and injuries as reasons for leaving the profession or being on modified work or medical leave . A report commissioned by the Ontario Health Coalition and released in January 2020 found that long-term care ( LTC ) homes in Ontario were routinely operating with one or two too few PSWs per shift and were short by as many as 10 workers in a 24-hour period . The situation in community settings is no better as patients are discharged from hospitals to their homes needing care , and there are not enough PSWs to meet the demand . <p> Now , as we begin to recover from the first wave of the pandemic , PSW educators across the country predict the shortage will be exacerbated . Negative media attention related to LTC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undervalued profession an appealing career choice . In my opinion , acknowledging the crisis is not enough . To recruit and retain an adequate PSW workforce and to properly protect the public , we need to initiate a revolution . A revolution that includes regulation of PSWs . <p> As a registered nurse , I worked alongside PSWs on a palliative care unit in a downtown Toronto hospital . I started teaching PSWs and facilitating their clinical experiences more than 20 years ago . I became a PSW advocate after realizing that the dedication and genuine big-heartedness of student and working PSWs goes virtually unnoticed . It is not uncommon to see student graduates ask to continue visiting their " first patient " or employed PSWs come in early for a shift to ensure residents are cared for in a less rushed manner.PSWs are the pillars of the health care delivery team . They provide personal care , medication management andbasic assessment of clients , and work in a variety of care settings including the community ( adult day programs , supportive housing , retirement homes ) , private homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked by millions around the world ; if theywalked off their jobs today , the framework of our health care systemwould be disrupted in epic proportions . Vulnerable Canadians would suffer . And yet , these workers are not regulated in Canada . They do not have licenses , they do not have a governing body overseeing their practice and they do not have standardized training . <p> PSWs do not even have a recognizable name . This type of worker can also be called a personal care assistant , resident care aide , certified health aide , home attendant , clinical assistant , and tens of other names . This creates confusion about and diminishes what PSWs do . Regulation would provide a standardized title for this worker , which would help give Canadians assurance about who is providing their care . <p> Canada 's elderly population is expanding , and seniors often have co-morbidities ( multiple illnesses ) that can be complex . It would be safer to have their care provided by regulated PSWs who receive standardized education . Currently in Ontario , PSW training is offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards . Each has its own standards , length of program ( 600 -- 750+ hours ) , cost ( $1,000 -- $15,000 ) , content delivery format , and evaluative measures . Stunningly , there are large variations in the clinical hours required to safely graduate . Non-standardized education leads to a non-standardized graduate . <p> I was approached several weeks ago by a company researching the feasibility of creating a six-to-eight-week online PSW course . I understand the need to replenish the PSW workforce ; what I do not support is providing an abbreviated online course . You can not safely and effectively provide students with the knowledge and skill development they need solely via computer -- it is not safe or ethical . If PSWs were regulated , this quick-fix approach would not even be considered . <p> The primary function of regulation is to protect the public . Regulation wouldimplement measures to ensure that only qualified , competent , and professional PSWs are providing care . A PSW regulatory college , like those of nurses and physicians , would serve as the governing body for PSWs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional obligations clear . Entry to practice would be regulated . PSWs would have to meet criteria to be licensed and to keep their licenses . <p> Licensing PSWs would alsoprovide a great resource to the public : a registry.This would allow for data collection and a better understanding of who comprises the workforce and where the market demands are . A registry like this would be useful during emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic where a formalized " call to arms " could be issued and PSWs could be deployed to areas in need . Having a license to practise comes with responsibilities such as committing to being a lifelong learner and following a professional code of ethics and professional standards of practice . The college of PSWS would be a place for the public to bring concerns and complaints and see that discipline , if appropriate , was delivered should a PSW not uphold their responsibilities . Regulating PSWs would keep Canadians safer , providing workers with the legitimacy of an overseeing body and the public with a route to recourse . <p> If regulation of PSWs had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , there is no doubt the situation in LTC through the pandemic would have been different . There would be more PSWs , better paid PSWs and standardized PSWs slogging on the frontlines . <p> In my opinion , resolving the PSW shortage is imperative , and regulating PSWs is an obvious strategy . As Canadians , we are collectively responsible for this . Regulatory infrastructure requires investment . Federal and provincial officials have offered financial support to Canadians in various ways through this crisis ; we also need their commitment to see that PSWs are regulated . Through demanding regulation and bettercompensation for PSWs , we can demonstrate our commitment to securing a safer future for Canadians . In other words , by investing in PSWs , we invest in ourselves .

An official said Esper has asked for a delay in any public announcement while he considers the recommendation . <p> Earlier in the day , Esper 's chief spokesman Jonathan Hoffman had suggested that Esper was going into the matter with an open mind , and said " he is generally inclined to support Navy leadership in their decision .

There have been ongoing questions about whether Navy leaders took too long to acknowledge the ship 's problems and if other commanders share blame for not being responsive to Crozier 's concerns . <p> One senior defence official said the investigation covered a complex timeline of communications that spanned multiple time zones and military commands . The official said Esper wants to make sure the report is thorough and stands up to scrutiny . <p> Rep. Adam Smith , a Washington state Democrat and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , urged Esper to restore Crozier to command . <p> " While Captain Crozier 's actions at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastic and imperfect , it is clear he only took such steps to protect his crew , " Smith said in a statement . <p> The extraordinary episode has captivated a public already overwhelmed by the pandemic .

Sailors who test negative after time in quarantine are suddenly showing symptoms a day or two later . The virus ' bewildering behaviour , which is challenging the broader international medical community . is making it harder to determine when the carrier might be able to return either to duty or head home . <p> Gilday 's recommendations were first reported by The New York Times . <p> Crozier was fired April 2 by Modly after sending an email to several naval officers warning about the growing virus outbreak and asking for permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an extraordinary move that would take the carrier out of duty in an effort to save lives . <p> " We are not at war .

Modly also asserted that Crozier had improperly allowed sensitive information about the ship 's condition to become public . <p> A few days later , Modly flew out to the ship and delivered a profanity-laced condemnation of Crozier over the loudspeaker to the crew . Crozier , he said , may have been " too naive or too stupid " to be commanding officer of the ship . <p> Just hours after his comments were widely reported , Modly apologized .

Esper first demanded Modly apologize and a day later accepted his resignation . <p> President Donald Trump has expressed seemingly contradictory views on the matter . He initially blasted Crozier , calling his memo " terrible . " But a short time later he softened his take , saying he did n't want to destroy someone who may just have " had a bad day .

@@51710941 <p> Thank you , operator , and welcome , everyone , to this Q1 release for Hoist Finance . And present today from our side is , as usual , our CFO , Christer Johansson ; and our Head of Investor Relations , Andreas Lindblom . They 're in Stockholm . I 'm still in a lockdown situation at the moment . <p> First of all , let me start by saying that I hope you 're all well and things are solely but surely getting better for you wherever you are . I guess most of us have been working now for the last 6 to 8 weeks , and I 've learned many ways , new ways of working . Secondly , let me just use this opportunity to thank all my colleagues in Hoist Finance . You have ensured business continuity and have kept the customer dialogues going over the last couple of months in a very challenging circumstances . I am very proud of the work the team has done to support our customers in the best possible way during the pandemic . <p> As far as Q1 is concerned , I have basically 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're seeing , the underlying business is resilient and robust given the circumstances . The exception is Spain where we have continued to struggle . Number two is that the impact of COVID-19 is visible towards the end of the quarter . We will experience collection delays in Q2 , but we believe that things will trend back towards a more normalized situation in the second half of the year . And message #3 , in this opening statement , is that our strategy of digital transformation , cost reductions and protecting our capital is working . And I believe that we are well positioned for the market opportunities ahead . <p> With that as a background , moving to Slide #3 , we will take you through the following agenda today . The key highlights , of course , the financial update , funding , capital and liquidity . We will do a summary in Q&amp;A . <p> But before moving to Slide #4 , let me also say that we have tried to expand disclosure in this presentation to make sure that the key messages get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we hope this is helpful . <p> So moving on to Slide #4 . A key highlight of this quarter follows from what I said in my opening statement . It is , first of all , great to see how quickly we have executed on our business continuity plans . We are obviously very pleased with the AT1 , we did in February . An important milestone for us is to deliver on our ESG strategy and to have updated our brand . The challenges in Spain have continued , accentuated by the COVID-19 situation and they 're written down the book value in Spain . However , as I said before , it 's better to have one problem than many . And we know that our new team in Spain is turning every stone and get back on track . <p> As far as the financial performance is concerned , Christer will explain things in detail , of course . But from my point of view , the key things to remember are , first of all , that the adjusted EBITDA shows strong cash flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter . Profit before tax adjusted for items affecting comparability is SEK 92 million compared to SEK 226 million in the first quarter of 2019 . This legacy deviation is largely explained by Spain and some forward-looking recruitment write-downs . CET1 ratio is 9.5% and investments , SEK 545 million . <p> As you can see from the next slide , Slide #5 , the adjusted EBITDA is significantly up , 25% compared to previous quarter . And this is actually the highest adjusted EBITDA that Hoist Finance has ever seen . <p> Moving on to Slide #6 . I 'm very satisfied with our business continuity . This slide shows the ramp up of the capacity for remote working by country . And as you can see , we are more or less in the 100% capacity in all markets . Now , of course , as the constraints are being lifted , we are preparing for welcoming our colleagues back to the office in a safe way . <p> Moving on to Slide #7 . I think it 's fair to say that working from home to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a new experience . We have been prioritizing accessibility , quality assurance and security to protect both customers and agents . Generally speaking , what we have learned has surprised us positively and our collaboration tools have been instrumental . Having said that , I think it 's clear that not everyone can work effectively from home for a number of reasons . And hence there is a drag on productivity in some markets . <p> Looking at customer behavior and in response to the pandemic . We have observed a slight reduction of around 10% in repayment plan and a somewhat larger drop-off of around 20% in one-off settlements . This shows that the repayment plans are holding up fairly good . We 're also pleased to see that the percentage of customers being digitally self-served is increasing . And the run rate is now at 17% . <p> First year of the week ( sic ) week of the year , we did a survey in Italy , that showed that close to 90% of our customers indicate that they will pay according to plan . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply could n't pay because the banks were closed . They just could n't get to the bank . And I believe that this survey shows that our customers are willing to pay , but perhaps not always able to do so . <p> When you go to the next slide , by the end of the quarter , we launched a new ESG strategy , focused on the 4 pillars as you can see in this slide . Our mission is to help people keep their commitments . Consequently for us , making sure that the financial market is accessible for all , it 's particularly meaningful . In tough times , like now , it is important for us to show that we are on our customers ' side . <p> Can we go to the next slide , please ? Having financial difficulties is a heavy burden to carry . Falling into debt can basically happen to everyone . And this is something we are being reminded of , basically as we speak . And having a social approach to our work is part of our DNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are proud to have launched 3 initiatives in the quarter to show our commitment to deliver on our ESG strategy . We just now launched , and we are collaborating with Appjobs , the world 's largest digital platform , for finding jobs online . We believe that this can be a valuable help for our customers to find new sources of income in times of crisis . Appjobs is a free digital platform that is active in all our markets , has over 1,200 companies registered and gets more than 5,000 new online job listings per week . The initial launch for us is in the France and in the U.K. and will be followed by Poland . <p> The 2 other initiatives are TEAM U and ONSbank . And these are examples of initiatives where we support local communities and organizations who are working for financial institution in society . We are building on our core competence and are happy providers of know-how and skills to these great organizations . <p> Moving to the next page . I think we all appreciate the seriousness and uncertainty caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen before , and I find it hard to give clear guidance . However , it comes to no surprise that we see increased financial stress despite fiscal stimulus . <p> The graph shows that the banks have been reducing the nonperforming exposures since the outbreak of the financial crisis . And we are now basically down to the pre-crisis level of nonperforming loans . However , we do observe that banks are now significantly increasing the loan provisioning . The nonperforming exposures will increase , and we have indicated here a scenario where NPL stocks return to the levels we saw during the financial crisis . <p> And now I hand over to Christer , and he will take us through the financials . So over to you , Christer . <p> Thank you , and good morning . So starting on Page 12 , as Klaus-Anders described , Q1 was a challenge . Looking back at the last couple of quarters , we have delivered profits of around SEK 200 million before tax with the growing book and improving efficiency , one would and should expect us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we report a SEK 61 million loss before tax , mainly driven by 4 items . The first 2 items we disclosed already on March 27 , and this relates to us taking an impairment on our Spanish loan portfolio of around SEK 106 million . And we have also unrealized mark-to-market losses in our treasury portfolio amounting to SEK 47 million . <p> Thirdly , we have seen COVID-19-related court closures in several markets . This did not impact Q1 collections . And for example , collections in the new large French portfolio has been above expectations . Nevertheless , it is prudent to recognize that this will cause delays in future collections , primarily on secured NPL portfolios . And this , in turn , triggered a SEK 20 million impairment in the value of our loan book . <p> Finally , actual collections in the quarter did not quite reach our targeted level . We saw reduced momentum towards the end of the quarter in several markets , and this was most pronounced in Spain and Greece . A collection shortfall in those 2 markets alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the split with the shortfall in Spain adding to the impairment in Spain then . Overall , collection level for the unsecured book came in at 98% . <p> Turning to Page 13 . We have , as we always do , included a year-on-year comparison with items affecting comparability excluded . You will see double-digit growth on top line , but we also have interest expense coming up quite a bit . This is a result of structural changes in 2019 , which I will get back to on a later page . <p> As covered on the previous slide , we saw weaker collection performance with the end of the quarter trending down towards an overall level of 90% . This impacts the impairment losses and gain line . <p> On the expense side , 2 key comments to start with . Collection cost is growing , but it 's only growing half as much as the book , 8% versus 17% on the book . Secondly , expense levels in Q1 are impacted by IT-related costs . And already before COVID-19 , we had embarked to transform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this together with our outsourcing partner , LTI . Now as crisis-related restrictions took hold , some of those work streams went into overdrive . It came with a cost that made a very significant difference to our ability to keep operations going . <p> Turning to Page 14 . We have included the corresponding comparison of financials as reported . I think we 've already covered the key items . And although this table stops before tax , I would just like to mention that net profit at negative SEK 44 million is impacted by deferred tax assets relating to our Spanish business . <p> Turning to Page 15 and focusing on cost savings . This has been a top priority for us ever since 2018 . And based on the potential we had estimated at that time , we have committed ourselves to take out SEK 300 million in cost run rate by 2021 . As per end of March this year , our list of completed actions add up to SEK 136 million , with site consolidation , IT outsourcing and reduced spend on professional services being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big ticket items here are really digitalization of collection and moving roles to shared service center and nearshoring locations . We 've made good progress on both of those fronts . And as we see what 's working , we update our view on what the end stage should look like . <p> Taking a 2022 perspective , knowing what we know now , our current assessment is that digital collections should go from its current 17% to 30% and that the share of tasks carried out in shared service center and nearshoring locations should go from its current 9% to 25% . Furthermore , we 've also identified additional savings and delivered a few very tangible examples . This includes using modern collaboration tool to reduce travel costs further . It also includes being more flexible in working-from-home options , allowing us to reduce cost for office space and for backup sites , which , frankly , I do n't think we need . All in all , given this updated assessment , we still target to deliver SEK 300 million by 2021 , but we also commit ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings by end of 2022 . <p> Moving on to Page 16 , that 's staying on the cost theme . We are growing the book quite a bit , 17% , over the last 12 months . And for this reason , it makes sense to look at cost in terms of key ratios as a complement to looking at costs in absolute numbers . And make no mistake , cost-to-income is our preferred metric . It 's the one we have our 65% target on . This target , we remain committed to delivering . Cost/income in this quarter is 87% after adjusting for IAC , which clearly is far from satisfying . Now with impairment and funding costs moving around a bit , we believe it 's helpful in this quarter to also look at the trend in cost in relation to collection . And as you can see on the slide , there is real progress in cost efficiency . <p> Moving on to Page 18 . When it comes to funding costs , I mentioned on one of the previous slides that it has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this relates to longer deposit durations and securitization positions as we have communicated throughout 2019 . Comparing to Q4 ' 19 instead , the position is largely unchanged . In deposit versus the majority of our funding , we have not seen any difference in customer behavior . The mix of deposits and the interest rate levels they 're stable . <p> On capital market debt , the situation is also unchanged . And remember that the AT1 instrument is reported as part of equity . One can , however , note that the weaker Swedish krona inflates coupons paid in euro . Interest expense to book sits at 2.6% . That would have been at 2.4% , if not for the oversized liquidity position . <p> Finally , one can note that the closest bond maturity is in Q4 2021 . <p> Continuing to capital and liquidity on Page 19 . The CET1 ratio remains in our target range , and the target range has come down by 30 basis points during the quarters since regulators have reduced requirements through the so-called countercyclical buffers . Looking at the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and total capital ratios being strengthened , and this is as a result of the Q1 issuance of EUR 40 million in a Tier 1 capital . <p> Finally , on the right-hand side , liquidity remains very strong . Now in the crisis , that 's not a bad thing . However , it comes with the costs . And since we are not expecting large acquisitions in the near term , we will , as the macro setting stabilizes , manage this down because there 's simply no need for SEK 9.4 billion given the steady and predictable cash flow generation of this business . <p> On Page 20 , I wanted to bring that to life a little bit , focusing on cash flow from operating activities , as it 's called in our audited cash flow statement . For a true view of the underlying level , one should adjust for cash flow from hedging , which is classified as operational . Those cash flows will even out , but they can be quite significant in the single periods . Having done that adjustment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 12 months . And that 's something that you can compare to the replacement investment grade , which is at SEK 3.4 billion . Now all of this is , of course , history , and the future is perhaps of greater interests , at least in the current setting . <p> For this reason , we have , on Page 21 , included our current projection for future collections , ERC . This is , of course , post the Q1 impairments , which we 've described . We also commented specifically on secured collections . And as you can tell , that is actually a smaller part of the overall ERC figure , even more so in the longer run , where our unsecured banking books provide long , steady cash flows , originating from millions of customers . As shown , also without any new acquisitions , we expect quarterly collections in the rest of 2020 to be close to the levels seen in Q4 ' 19 and Q1 2020 . It 's perhaps needless to say that the outlook today is a bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen before . <p> Turning to Page 22 . We have included a bit of our collection history from the dot-com bubble and the financial crisis . And our observation seems to align well with what others in the industry have noted , namely , that collections at the peak of the crisis may suffer . We 've seen shortfalls of up to 10% on the overall book , but that most of this will be recovered later on . So in other words , it 's a delay rather than a reduction in lifetime collections . Now we 're , of course , humble about the current challenges to society , and we keep multiple scenarios in mind . But based on our experience , collection will be resilient . <p> That observation ends the financial part , and I hand back to Klaus-Anders for summary and Q&amp;A . <p> Thanks , Christer . When we are looking ahead , and then we are on Page 24 , I guess , it is always an absolute ( inaudible ) , right ? We are absolutely not happy with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do better . The Spanish situation is the biggest disappointment . Given the magnitude of the crisis , I 'm , however , happy to see we have kept the shop open and our collection remains reasonably resilient , as Christer just described . And relative to competition , I am pleased with our access to funding , and our cost of funding is the lowest in the industry . And in a capital-intensive business like ours , which is clearly a strong competitive advantage , we have increased the scope for operational improvements . And the team is working really hard to make sure that we are ready to capture our lion 's share on a growing market opportunity . <p> Moving on then to Slide #25 . It follows from what we have presented here today , that our priorities , at the moment , are to prepare what happens when the lockdown now comes to an end . We are determined , as ever , to reduce our costs , and we have increased the scope . The digital transformation is happening , and we are leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower costs internally , and , of course , offers a much better service for our customers . <p> And I guess , this concludes our presentation , and we open up for Q&amp;A . So over to the operator . <p> I have 2 quick questions , if I may . Firstly , I saw your press release , that there is some difference between the collections in the secured and unsecured NPLs . I would like to ask if you could please provide more details ? <p> And then secondly , I also found interesting the outlook that you provided on the NPLs . I would like to ask if you could provide more details , like expectations for the various markets ? <p> All right . Thanks , Borja , to tag on the call . So the difference between secured and unsecured , this is , of course , basically related to litigation . And of course , when courts are closed in some markets , it is really hard to carry out litigation . So it 's not like it 's closed in all markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in France and Italy . There is a delay in secured collections at this point in time . But we are not wasting our time . We are preparing for when the courts are opening again . <p> As far as differences between different markets , I guess , it 's fair to say that Spain has been our most problematic market at this point in time . This is not new to you , and it 's not new to us , of course . The corona crisis kind of accentuated the problems in Spain . But I also see that some of our competitors are feeling the same issues in the Spanish markets . In Italy , which I think a lot of people worry about , I think collections have been pretty strong actually given the circumstances . At least on our side , it has . We are very strong in the segment called Cambiali . Cambiali has been upholding in a good manner . I think the slide that I referred to should give you some comfort in terms of what we can expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to see overall that the second quarter can land in terms of collection performance around 90% . So that 's something we work out into the report , and that 's really what we expect to see for the quarter . I 'm not sure if you want to add something there , Christer , on secured or unsecured , for instance , or anything else ? <p> I think what I can just add is collections in this quarter , actual collections in Q1 was actually pretty strong on the secured side , and that 's partly a result of a good start to the large portfolio we bought in France . And the court delays that Klaus-Anders has mentioned , those are something that will come into force more for Q2 and Q3 rather than Q1 . <p> I 'm going to start off by apologizing . I have n't , as you can probably imagine , heard anything on this call . But just 2 questions , if I may . Could you please remind me of the dynamics of the SPV in terms of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's start off with that , perhaps . <p> Yes . So as Klaus-Anders mentioned , our Italian collections have actually held up well . And at the levels we 're currently observing , there 's sort of no dynamics going on in between the co-investor and us . This is a scenario , which is well in line with what we have anticipated going into the structure . <p> Let 's assume it deteriorates , then what happens ? I mean , in terms of subordination as the structure of sort of the yields within that ? I mean , was it 15% the yield and -- on the co-investment to tranches ? Those are presumably prioritized . Will you , in a scenario where things really go bad , be -- could you theoretically be zeroed out from the SPV ? Perhaps that 's an easy way to face it . <p> Exactly . So the tranche is clear , right ? It 's 85% , which is senior and 15% , which is less than the units and junior . Of the 15% , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the units and the senior . So I guess , from a risk point of view , that will just follow the tranches in a custom better way . And of course , the economic upside , above the 15% yield that we are paying the investor , comes to Hoist . So right now , everything is fine , everything is intact with no concerns and no issues with the securitization structure . <p> And I can just add that the anticipated collections on the portfolios in the securitization structure covers the repayment of the senior and the unit tranche with quite a lot of margin . So basically , the -- any realized collection shortfall will be a delay in repayment rather than a reduction since there 's such a big buffer in that structure . <p> And I 'm sure you 've touched upon it in the call , but the liquidity situation , I mean , is there a rationale behind increasing liquidity despite already being quite -- having quite a lot of liquidity as is ? And then , what are you looking to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a very good question . And just as you say , the liquidity level of 9.4% is really more than what we need . Clearly , going into this quarter , we had anticipated larger acquisitions than what we have seen and this has also impacted the liquidity then in a sense . Over time , this is something that we will manage down . And the easiest way to manage this down is to be less attractive on the offered rates on deposits . And then we have a lot of experience on how that sort of impact net flows , and that it will allow us to manage this liquidity down . <p> All right . Well , thanks , everybody , for participating on the call . I appreciate that some of you listened to one of our competitors .

@@51711641 <h> Pope urges forgiveness in Colombia after decades of conflict <p> BOGOTA -- Pope Francis urged young Colombians on Thursday to take the lead in promoting forgiveness to help their country heal from a half-century of conflict , saying they should " look to the future without the burden of hatred " that their elders often carry . <p> From the halls of the presidential palace to the green hills of Bogota 's Simon Bolivar park , Francis brought his message of reconciliation to a country still bitterly divided over the peace deal with leftist rebels that is seeking to end Latin America 's longest-running armed rebellion . And he demanded that its leaders now address the gross inequalities that sparked the conflict to begin with . <p> " Let us not forget that inequality is the root of social ills , " he told a crowd at Bogota 's presidential palace that included disabled children and soldiers with amputated limbs . <p> While his appeal for forgiveness may be hard for some to swallow , Francis was nevertheless given a rock star 's welcome on his first full day in Colombia . Young choir members abandoned their positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he arrived . In Bogota 's main Plaza Bolivar , thousands of young people interrupted him repeatedly with cheers . And officials estimated 1.3 million people flocked to Bogota 's main park for his open-air Mass , far more than the 700,000 expected . <p> History 's first Latin American pope took the crowds , interruptions , protocol hiccups and security breaches in stride , seemingly relishing in the adoration of one of the continent 's most staunchly Roman Catholic countries . <p> His message though was stern , urging the country 's elite and ordinary to resist the temptation for vengeance , the " corrupting darkness " of self-interest , and instead build bridges to help the nation heal . <p> " The solitude of always being at loggerheads has been familiar for decades , and its smell has lingered for a hundred years , " he said , alluding to the most famous work of Colombia 's Nobel laureate , Gabriel Garcia Marquez . " We do not want any type of violence whatsoever to restrict or destroy one more life . " <p> One year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , better known by its Spanish acronym FARC , the guns have fallen silent and 7,000 rebels are transitioning back to civilian life . But Colombians remain badly divided over the accord , with conservative opponents seeing it as too generous for the guerrillas who were behind scores of atrocities during the conflict . <p> In all , the fighting left more than 250,000 people dead , 60,000 missing and millions more displaced . <p> Francis is expected to press his call for forgiveness further on Friday when he travels to Villavincencio , south of Bogota , where he is to preside over a meeting of reconciliation between victims of the conflict and those who victimized them . <p> " It 's a great message for all of the country , especially because of the moment we are living in , " said Maria Juliana Higuera , one of more than 20,000 people who packed Bogota 's central Plaza Bolivar for a papal blessing .

" <p> " You make us see the wider world which stands before us , the whole of Colombia that wishes to grow and continue its development , " he said . <p> Looking ahead , Francis insisted that Colombia now needed to enact " just laws " to resolve the structural causes of poverty and inequality to " overcome the conflicts that have torn apart this nation for decades . " <p> The FARC formed as a Marxist army in the mid-1960s to overthrow Colombia 's economic and social system and open the way to redistributing land . <p> While the first year of the accord 's implementation has seen the FARC disarm , it also has been marked by the state 's failures to bring services to hard-to-reach communities where the government has historically had little presence and where rebels are beginning a new chapter as civilians . Former guerrillas arriving at many of the 26 demobilization zones found little more than fields of mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the buildings with running water and electricity that the government promised . <p> Colombia is the most unequal country in terms of land distribution in Latin America , itself the worst region in the world . Large agricultural holdings of more than 500 hectares represent around 0.4 per cent of all farms in Colombia but control more than 67 per cent of the productive land , according to an Oxfam report last year . <p> The peace deal and an earlier land reform are supposed to redistribute the land and compensate victims driven from their homesteads by illegal armed groups . But authorities overseeing the process have been slow to hand out titles , and peasanto farmers in far-flung regions face numerous threats asserting their rights . Last year , 59 human rights defenders -- many of them land rights activists -- were killed yet only a handful of their murders ever solved , according to the United Nations . <p> President Juan Manuel Santos , who won last year 's Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end the conflict , urged Colombians to let go of lingering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we remain armed in our hearts , " he told the crowd . " Ending the war is worthless if we still see each other as enemies . " <p> In between his main events Thursday , Francis met with bishops from around the region , including his first encounter with clergy from neighbouring Venezuela who are looking for the pope to demand accountability from their country 's socialist government and deliver a message of hope to that nation torn by political and economic turmoil . <p> Cardinal Jorge Urosa Savino , archbishop of Caracas , said the situation was " truly desperate , " with people eating garbage and dying for lack of medicine . " So we want to remind the pope of this again and especially the serious political situation because the government is doing everything possible to establish a state system , totalitarian and Marxist , " he said . <p> Prince Albert restaurant owners are signaling a degree of relief as they start planning seating and table layouts for the re-opening of their main doors on June 8 .

Photo : Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters <p> Disaster resilience and climate change have been and continue to be high on the development agenda for Bangladesh . Significant investments have been made over the years through infrastructural interventions , policy changes , institutional capacity building and awareness campaigns . In turn , each passing year has yielded impressive dividends with the country and its people growing increasingly adept at handling natural disasters with fewer casualties and better rebuilding . <p> But now Bangladesh is faced with an unprecedented crisis . The nation has not had to battle anything remotely akin to the coronavirus pandemic in its recent history . The dominance of the informal sector in the economy paired with lack of adequate preparedness is revealing some serious underlying fragilities which pose far-reaching implications for developing countries such as Bangladesh and most of its South Asian neighbours . <p> Initially considered a public health crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting each and every aspect of public life -- in fact the collateral impacts of the outbreak in the form of millions becoming the " new poor " within weeks , going hungry and impoverished , and social discontent growing as prevention measures hit at the roots of culture and traditional practice have far outstripped the numbers directly affected by the disease . <p> Mere survival has become a challenge for those reliant on daily incomes , and those living in urban slums or remote areas . There are thousands who were never classified as being under the poverty line , such as barbers and rickshaw-pullers , who are now struggling to live day to day . Then there are several thousand blue collar workers in the lower to middle class who may not be able to return to their jobs in the immediate future . Many from these socio-income groups will very soon get affected and become tomorrow 's poor . <p> While it is universally agreed that speed is of the essence , it is important that the multi-sectoral nature of the crisis should drive an integrated response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governance becomes an issue to reflect upon -- as the culture of data sharing is yet to be embedded institutionally . <p> Although this is one of the biggest crisis the world has ever seen , lessons from similar public health induced multi-dimensional humanitarian disasters should be studied . Some of the key lessons from the 2014 Ebola Outbreak and subsequent recovery that I imbibed as a frontline responder can help point to important considerations . <p> Firstly , we must act speedily , and always maintain transparency and accuracy of information . This is crucial as crises tend to shake citizens ' confidence , and ensuring their trust is critical for an effective campaign . <p> Next , both the response and recovery demanded behavioural change to minimise impacts and avert future crisis . Efforts to bring such change were more effective with closer community engagement , which helps sensitise response and recovery to local norms and practical needs . This required engagement with local and religious leadership who have great influence over their communities . With good information and greater awareness , communities tend to own up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The highest attention should be given to the population segments most disproportionately affected . Alongside this , building a resilient private sector , especially small businesses , can help ensure a swifter and more sustainable economic recovery . <p> The final lesson was the state 's acknowledgment that such a crisis is a fuel for social discontent and instability , therefore all response and recovery measures should not be driven by heavy-handed administrative and public security measures . <p> To stop poverty from grappling Bangladesh , we need plans for immediate recovery that will feed into longer-term plans . But such plans have never been drawn up before ; there are no ready-made solutions . While the government will need to bring well-resourced programmes and policies for accelerated recovery into the five-year planning frame , United Nations with UNDP as the overall technical lead is also offering support to all affected countries . <p> Multi-sectoral recovery interventions has to include helping the health sector stabilise ; assisting the worst-hit people to weather the crisis ; restoring small businesses so they can provide access to livelihoods , and prompt restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these will bolster social stability . <p> The pandemic has resulted in more inequality than ever before , and has also highlighted the heavy price the planet has been paying for unsustainable economic growth . The UN Secretary General has renewed a call for global solidarity and appealed for recovery pathways to clean , green , and more responsible consumption . <p> UNDP has been a longstanding partner of Bangladesh in various key areas of development , from addressing urban poverty to climate change to the Rohingya refugee crisis . Our work here has helped take Bangladesh forward in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) , but now , we must rethink our approach in achieving them within the 2030 target . In fact , the SDGs are more important now than ever -- social discrimination and inequality is on the rise , making SDG-10 a top priority . Meanwhile , this crisis and the subsequent shutdown has shown the importance of letting nature into our lives , to allow it to heal , increasing the priority of environmental and conservational goals . <p> Along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , USAID , Swedish SIDA , DANIDA , Australian DFAT , the EU , Canadian GAC , philanthropic foundations and several private sector partners is already working to support the poor across Bangladesh , while also trying to better prioritise response and recovery , and learning new lessons . <p> We are realising the critical need for proper coordination not just within the public sector but also between the public and private sectors . I have always maintained from my own experience that such coordination needs to be " dedicated , full-time , and necessarily empowered to be decisive " . With improved coordination the speed and effectiveness will undoubtedly increase , enabling better risk-sharing between public and private sectors as the debate on " lives versus livelihoods " hits centre-stage . <p> This pandemic is telling us to entirely rethink development . This will require unlearning many of the old ways and adopting brand new approaches that make humankind more equal , inclusive and responsible towards each other and the planet .

@@51718241 <p> Canadian jurisdictions lack options to legally compel people to receive a future COVID-19 vaccine , but several former health ministers and attorney generals say that level of intervention is n't necessary and a comprehensive and co-ordinated education campaign would be more appropriate . <p> " Then all of a sudden everybody wanted to get their child immunized . There were lineups in the rain of parents pushing babies in strollers waiting to get vaccinated . It was really , really rough , " Matthews said . <p> There are no proven vaccines against the new coronavirus , and one is n't expected to be cleared for the public for months , at minimum . But once one , or multiple , vaccines are approved in Canada , somewhere between one and a half to two times the percentage of Canadians who got the H1N1 shot ( 60-80 per cent , based on what 's known about the infectiousness of the virus ) will have to be immunized against COVID-19 for the country to achieve herd immunity . This is the term for the benchmark that enough of a group is resistant to an infection to ward it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no requirement that anyone in Ontario , or elsewhere in Canada , get vaccinated . In fact , there 's never been a legally mandated vaccination campaign in Canada . <p> Overall , vaccination rates in children are strong -- according to the 2017 Childhood National Immunization Coverage Survey , 90 per cent of two-year-old children had received at least one of two recommended doses of measles vaccines , and 76 per cent of two-year-old children have received all four recommended doses of vaccines against diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis . Only 2.3 per cent of children had not been vaccinated . <p> Adults , on the other hand , lag behind when it comes to getting their annual flu vaccine . " Too few Canadian adults " were vaccinated in the 2017-18 flu season , according to the Public Health Agency of Canada . The percentage who were , 38 per cent , was less than half of the national goal of 80 per cent . <p> Ontario is one of two provinces ( New Brunswick is the other ) , according to Immunize Canada , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain vaccinations . Parents can seek exemptions , which are given only for medical , philosophical or religious reasons . <p> Matthews recalled the guidance of her government 's legal professionals being that you could only go so far to encourage people to get vaccinated . <p> " The advice that I recall getting was that you could n't compel , but you could restrict . If ( people ) had n't been immunized then ( they ) ca n't , ' fill in the blank , ' " she said . <p> Dr. Helena Jaczek , a Liberal MP who was Ontario 's health minister at the tail end of the Wynne Liberal government , recalled that prior to her career in politics , when she was medical officer of health in York Region , the upper-tier municipality was able to persuade health-care workers to get their seasonal flu vaccine if they worked in an environment ( such as at a long-term care facility ) where there had been an outbreak of the flu , or else it would n't allow them to come to work . Working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of them spreading an infection to at-risk patients . <p> " People did then say , ' Well I do n't want to lose my sick leave , or I do n't have any sick leave to lose and I 'll have to be unpaid , ' so that was a solution at the time , " Jaczek said . <p> Both former federal attorney general Rob Nicholson , who held the position in the Harper government during the H1N1 pandemic , and former Ontario attorney general John Gerretsen , who was in the position just after H1N1 , agreed that employers could have the ability to bar employees from work unless they 're vaccinated , but Gerretsen predicted that such rules would almost certainly be challenged in court . <p> " We would be on pretty unstable grounds if ( employers ) insisted that their employees be vaccinated . Maybe if it may be in the health field a bigger argument can be made , I suppose , because the health professionals exposed themselves more to potential contacts with people who have various diseases including Corona , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has since recovered . <p> Jaczek , who cautioned that such an idea has n't been discussed within the Liberal caucus , suggested that the Emergencies Act might be able to be leveraged , if needed , to compel people to get vaccinated . However , the Act 's allowances in a Public Welfare Emergency ( which can be used in the event of " disease in human beings " ) make no mention of such capabilities . <p> Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has resisted invoking the Emergencies Act during the pandemic , in part due to strong opposition from the provinces . <p> Gerretsen also said he could n't envision a government order being put in place , or legislation being enacted to require people to get vaccinated , because it would likely violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms . <p> Nicholson , Jaczek and Matthews each told iPolitics that what they believe will be centre to an eventual successful vaccination campaign across Canada is a collaborative effort between provinces and the federal government to properly inform Canadians that getting vaccinated is the proper course of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in this together . And , you know , I think the kind of messaging that would ( be effective ) -- once the vaccine ( is proven ) -- is , ' think about your grandmother , ' to all the young people , ' surely you do n't want her to get sick , ' " Jaczek said . <p> They also agreed that they expect Canadians to be so eager for a preventative shot against the coronavirus , that hitting the up-to-80-per-cent vaccination rate of herd immunity might even be simple . <p> " It depends on what this vaccine looks like . I mean , if it 's as effective as ( the polio vaccine was ) back in the 1950s , I think you 'll have no doubt that you 'll see well over 90 per cent of Canadians will want to have that , " Nicholson said .

" <p> With little information coming from the government , many seniors guessed that this payment would coincide with May 's OAS pension deposit . However , they were dismayed to find there was nothing extra when the money landed in their accounts Tuesday night . <p> " I did get my OAS payment today , but I did n't get the extra $300 which is what I was expecting . I thought this would have been the easy fix for them to get it out , " Janet Clarke , a 70 year old from Brantford , told CTVNews.ca . <p> Clarke said she did n't understand why the money was rolling out so much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canada Emergency Response Benefit ( CERB ) . <p> The CERB , which was announced on March 25 , opened for applications on April 6 , and saw payments delivered to bank accounts within 10 days . <p> " Everything else that they said they 're going to do came out very quickly .

@@61833341 <h> With safeguards in place , port confident of beating Covid-19 <p> One of the never-ending issues that complicate public perception about Kenya Ports Authority ( KPA ) is the confusion between the institution and the Port of Mombasa . <p> Actually , they say the easiest way to pull the rug from under the port 's success is to fail to understand the various stakeholders and their role in making the Port of Mombasa a success . The world over , the distinct roles of the port community and the institution that runs the port are always interrelated but unique in terms of interests , goals and objectives . How each seaport defines their stakeholder groups , identifies movers and shakers , carries out two-way communications and incorporates input varies by port and by country , but there are some commonalities and melting points . In a normal day , an average of more than 20,000 people enter and leave the port . Out of this massive human traffic , only 6,800 are employees of KPA . The rest are drawn from the port eco-system , comprising a vast range of cargo interveners that include shipping agents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary customers , transporters , residents of maritime districts , security agents , northern corridor actors , and business partners . <p> This number has remained constant courtesy of advancement in automation of key port services . The interaction level of all these people inside the port together with KPA is high . Depending on one 's work location , an employee has high chances of closely interacting with our different partners either in person or exchange paperwork for business transaction . Unique partner The fact that each unique partner demands a unique assortment of documents and processes adds complexity to the entire ecosystem . Equally important is that the port is a melting pot of international trade facilitators . The people inside the port , therefore , come from different parts of the globe , besides our East and Central Africa captive market . <p> When the coronavirus pandemic was first reported in the continent , KPA leadership swiftly formed a special committee comprising senior management staff and union representatives to manage the prevention and spread of the pandemic . The first focus was to control the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only visitors with special purposes and on written appointment could enter the port .

The close collaboration led to the setting up of 147 handwashing points , installation of hand sanitisers in all offices , as well as distribution and usage of protective equipment across all the interaction points in the port . The management embarked on continued health education and sensitisation of workers and the port community on Covid-19 preventive measures through PA systems in work areas and local radio stations .

To date , no crew of any vessel has tested positive . <p> The bottom line here , therefore , is that the pandemic has not found its way from the ships and crew which call at the port . Way forward The virus has found its way from the community , and the best way forward is to ensure that every member of the community observes hygiene protocols to stay safe and also avoid infecting others .

Their appeal is addressed to more than 15 large pharmaceutical companies around the world , such as Roche , Gilead and Johnson &amp; Johnson . <p> Leen Preesman <p> " For our pension savers , it is important that we ensure that the value that exists in these companies remains and grows over one , two and 20-year periods , " said Flod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the pandemic is over , he said , adding that AMF had a responsibility to ensure that its customers ' pensions were invested in firms that had long-term potential . <p> The pension fund , which is run on mutual principles said it had continued to invest despite recent market turbulence . <p> Recent deals included the increase of its equity stake in Swedish Hotel chain Scandic Hotels to 15% , AMF said , a SEK140m investment in Swedish wind power company Stena Renewable for the firm 's expansion , and a SEK280m investment in Swedish online supermarket MatHem . <p> The coverage ratios of Dutch pension funds could drop to below 70% if the crisis is lengthy , according to Willis Towers Watson ( WTW ) . <p> They could still bounce back to the level of 2019-end next year if the crisis turns out to be short , WTW said after assessing three scenarios . <p> The most optimistic of these assumes that the virus is brought under control before July , and that government support for households and companies turns out to be effective . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurring in the third quarter , combined with a worldwide recession , as well as a continuing low turnover for European and US companies in 2020 . <p> In WTW 's worst-case scenario , consumer confidence in Chinese exports will recover slowly , while unemployment in Europe and the US soars and companies go bust as a result of reduced financing options and credit facilities . <p> The main difference between the first and the second scenarios , which both include new COVID-19 cases in the third quarter , is the period that governments and banks need to support the economy , WTW said . <p> " Unless the social affairs ' minister Wouter Koolmees grants another leeway , this will lead to a reduction of pension rights and benefits at the pension funds with a consecutive funding shortfall in the past five years . " <p> Crisis leads to calls for early withdrawal <p> The COVID-19 crisis has reignited a debate in Austria over the long-term severance pay saving system , with a call for early withdrawals . <p> Wolfgang Katzian , president of the country 's Trade Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal of assets before the 36 month minimum period that applies under the current rule in cases of lost employment . <p> Under the Abfertigung Neu severance pay system , employers pay 1.53% of the gross salary from the second month of employment . <p> At the end of 2018 , some 3.5 million Austrians had saved ? 11.5bn in severance pay accounts with eight providers of betriebliche Vorsorgekassen . <p> Providers must offer a guarantee equal to the gross amount of contributions made and a maximum of 40% can be invested in equities . <p> However , the occupational severance pay funds umbrella group , Plattform der Betrieblichen Vorsorgekassen , said the ? GB 's proposal could be acceptable on the basis of a compromise that would include extending of the time the money remains in the accounts . <p> Across the globe , over 800,000 Australian pension savers have requested early release of part of their superannuation savings to tide them over the economic shutdown . <p> The number is double the account holders ( 361,000 ) who have accessed their savings prematurely over the past five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or A$2.9bn in total . <p> The nation 's largest super fund , AustralianSuper , expects to receive requests -- through the Australian Taxation Office , which is tasked with processing requests -- from over 300,000 members . <p> Such is demand for early release that questions have been raised about the ability of funds to meet obligations . There have been suggestions that the government might have to issue bonds to create liquidity . <p> Some conservative politicians blame the cash squeeze on industry funds for having invested in illiquid assets , such as infrastructure . <p> Luigi Serenelli &amp; Florence Chong <p> In the worldwide recession scenario , coverage ratio of Dutch pension funds would have recovered to approximately 95% on average at the end of 2021 , which is still about 10 percentage points short of the 2019 level . <p> The most extreme scenario assumes new hits on equity markets and long-term low interest rates . <p> In the UK , the aggregate deficit of defined benefit ( DB ) schemes potentially eligible for entry to the Pension Protection Fund ( PPF ) is estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? 135.9bn over March , the PPF announced in April . <p> This is equivalent to a fall in the funding ratio from 93.2% at the end of February to 92.5% at the end of March . <p> There were 114 more schemes in deficit at the end of March than a month previously , according to the new PPF figures . The shortfall of the schemes in deficit grew ? 9.3bn , from ? 244.8bn at the end of February to ? 254.1bn . <p> The change in the deficiency of schemes in deficit on a so-called section 179 basis is an illustration of the impact of changes in financial markets on the PPF 's total exposure . <p> A scheme 's s179 liabilities represent the premium that would have to be paid to an insurance company to take on the payment of PPF-levels of compensation . Schemes in surplus on an s179 basis at the time of insolvency usually do not enter the DB lifeboat fund . <p> A spokesperson for the ? 32bn PPF said the drop in schemes ' funding position over March was caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was partially offset by a decrease in liability values of about 1.6% due to an increase in index-linked bond yields . <p> Sion Cole , head of UK fiduciary business at BlackRock , said that since the start of the year funding levels have fallen 5.5% . " However , the variation around these figures will be significant , depending on the size of a scheme 's equity and credit allocations and amount of liability hedging , " he said . <p> " In short , it 's been a torrid start to the year for pension schemes and the volatility does not look set to disappear anytime soon . " <p> In April , the PPF said the COVID-19 outbreak was causing " daily changes to the way we work " . <p> Commenting on the fund 's business plan for 2020-21 , PPF chief executive officer Oliver Morley added : " The extent of the impact is , of course , unknown at this stage . We have chosen to leave our objectives as they stand but we accept that there may be challenges to achieving our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for beleaguered schemes and sponsors European pension funds and their sponsors are making use of regulatory relief through contribution holidays as firms battle for business survival . <p> In the Netherlands , Dutch pensions supervisor De Nederlandsche Bank ( DNB ) has said it will not object to pension funds deviating from their strategic investment plans " during the current extraordinary market conditions " . <p> However , it said that such decisions must be thoroughly underpinned , and take risk management into account . <p> It also highlighted that recovering pension funds will not be allowed to " deliberately and structurally " raise the risk profile of their investments . <p> The supervisor suggested that , given the changing economic conditions and worsening financial positions , pension funds should assess whether their current strategic investment policy still matches the risk attitude of their participants . <p> The supervisor has already offered pension funds the option to postpone submitting their monthly and quarterly reports . It has temporarily cancelled on-site investigations . <p> The DNB added that pension funds must put in a maximum effort to obtain pension premiums from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , emphasised that pension rights will remain if contributions are not paid , and a two-month leeway is legally possible . <p> At the launch of DNB 's annual report last month , Bos said the supervisor , the cabinet and industry organisations were discussing options in case of a continued crisis . " The question is whether and how the government 's emergency measures apply to employers ' premium payments , " she said . <p> The Dutch pension funds for the building , metal and cleaning sectors , hairdressers , hospitality workers , the travel industry and the retail sector have granted their affiliated employers leeway in paying their pension contributions . <p> The ? 67bn pension fund for the building industry ( BpfBOUW ) said that , in order to ease the pressure on employers , it had extended the term of payment until 1 June . <p> PMT and PME , the country 's pension funds for the metal sector , said they had also allowed affiliated employers to delay their contributions . <p> PME has granted a two-month leeway , while PMT allowed for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that tailored arrangements were possible for struggling firms . <p> PME said that its goal is to enable companies to easily apply a reduction of working hours , thereby improving their liquidity . <p> It added that it assumed that the government 's financial support will also offer a solution for the payment of pension premiums . <p> Peter Borgdorff , director of the ? 238bn healthcare scheme PFZW , added that about 200 employers were facing difficulties . He said that , instead of a general payment deferment , his scheme will assess requests case by case . <p> In the UK , more than 500 companies are likely to use new regulatory flexibilities and delay making pension deficit repair contributions ( DRCs ) according to a report from consultancy LCP in late April . <p> It estimated that about ? 500m ( ? 565m ) in total will be held back . <p> There have already been media reports that firms such as retailers Arcadia and Debenhams have sought to delay making DRCs . LCP says its analysis is the first industry-wide estimate of how widespread such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of data on more than 200 schemes for which it acts as an adviser . <p> This led to an estimate that at least 10% of sponsoring employers were likely to delay making contributions for at least three months . <p> Pension funds have had to adapt to social distancing working for operations such as trading while other staff have stayed at home . <p> In the Netherlands , some 100 of APG 's critical staff were still working in company offices last month . They represent people working in ICT , treasury and trading , as well as benefits payments . The company employs about 2,200 domestic workers . <p> The entire staff at APG 's New York office was working from home last month , while critical processes were run from the Netherlands . Hong Kong-based staff had restarted working in the office , albeit in separated teams , he said . <p> In Germany , BVK has had to reassess its internal organisation to follow social distancing , but it continues to " easily ensure " day-to-day business operations , with most of its employees currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support a constant exchange of information between the teams , according to CFO Andre ' Heimrich , adding that for several weeks now the fund 's internal task force has held regular virtual meetings . <p> The task force constantly evaluates the current situation and channels recommendations to take actions in terms of communication and internal processes . <p> These safeguards include that the companies must also be cutting back on dividends and bonuses and must have explored other methods of easing their cash-flow problems . <p> " The ability to agree with trustees a delay in making pension contributions will help them to weather the present storm and continue their support to the scheme in the long term . " <p> According to LCP , reasons for employers not seeking to take advantage of these easements included that their next contribution may not be due for some months , as some deficit contributions are only due annually or twice yearly . <p> In addition , some employers may consider that continuing to pay contributions now would support long-term plans for tackling the deficit . <p> Steve Webb , partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultancy had the impression some employers were trying to " reputation manage " , in that they would like to delay contributions but were aware of the potential implications , in terms of getting regulatory approval for a valuation on the basis of a strong employer covenant . <p> In Finland , moves by the government to help businesses cope with the immediate fallout will wipe out ? 1bn of contributions to occupational pension providers this year , and the sector faces other potential hits too , according to the Finnish Centre for Pensions . <p> The government has temporarily lowered earnings-related pension contribution requirements from employers by about 2% , and allowed businesses unable to operate during the crisis to postpone contributions completely for up to three months -- a measure agreed with la-bour-mar-ket organisations , it said . <p> The Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health confirmed in March that an exception was being granted for contributions due to the main occupational pension schemes -- TyEL for employees and YEL for the self-employed -- because of stretched economic conditions due to COVID-19 . <p> Jaak-ko Kian-der , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , statistics and planning , wrote : " The measures which have been decided upon will reduce the premium income of pension institutions by about ? 1bn for the current year .

A virtual-only shareholders meeting is regarded not to be permissible under the current Companies Act , because it requires the company to fix the " place " of the meetings while a virtual-only meeting can not be fixed at a physical location . <p> However , In Fujisoft Plc of Japan pioneered virtual-only shareholder meeting in March when it held a successful virtual annual general meeting . It may thus call for review of the law to anticipate technological changes in management of information among a company 's investors . <h> Also Read <p> Board meetings , especially in public sector organisations have been particularly hit hard given that holding them virtually presents challenges associated with issues such as electronic signature arrangements . <p> In addition , the law does not envisage situations where directors sitting in public entity boards appoint proxies to run affairs on their behalf , which further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arising from emoluments earned during such meetings as well as their sustainability given that so far there is no cure for Covid-19 . <p> The ability of business leaders to predict the future is significantly reduced by the pandemic , which means organisations need to be able to adapt to what is known about the prevailing environment . <p> At such times , they can have hypotheses and scenarios , but the greatest skill would be the organisations and its leadership 's ability to adapt . In seeking to bolster adaptability , a lot of this must be crafted within a clear communication landscape , be it with clients , staff , partners or stakeholders . Communication is the greatest weapon in the current situation . <p> CAPITAL ALLOCATION <p> One of the central pillars of corporate governance is capital allocation , and where companies decide to focus their funding . <p> According to BMO Financial Group , a diversified financial services provider based in North America , companies have been investing heavily to repurchase stock rather than investing in their businesses or bolstering up their balance sheets . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure and companies are facing significant unexpected costs dedicated to staff welfare , management are progressively reviewing the appropriateness of their share buy-back programmes both at this time and in the long- term . <p> Consequently , as a means of addressing some of challenges posed by Covid-19 , some companies have been forced to choose between cutting capital spending , dividend payments or costs possibly leading to redundancies . <p> As they steer through potentially severe financial threats and market forces , they may also be required to undertake excessive risks that might provide a short-term investor benefit , but could also expose a company 's financial steadiness or the sustainability of its business model . <p> Consequently , Covid-19 has forced abrupt shifts to new business models in ways that will significantly alter company risk and resilience . <p> Supply chains , already a target of economic nationalism in some countries , now face new questions about risk concentration . <p> In addition , company revenues are falling globally under twin blows of production disruptions and weakening demand with an economywide ripple effect . <p> ADMINISTRATION <p> Undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which general administration is being undertaken .

Like in the " Designated Survivor " TV drama series , it means organisations must consider appointing other individuals in case the single signatory becomes unavailable . <p> Technology also comes to the rescue . Going forward , organisations must adopt and devise strategies to maximise on off-site working or " working from home " . <p> Public sector entities must plan on how original documentation can be received and processed as required by law or as dictated by respective organisational policy .

For example , what plans do public sector organisations and private companies have in case key suppliers fail to deliver due to ongoing restrictions on movement ? <p> The ability to overcome crisis situations brings out outstanding leaders . Some critical questions to ask business and political leaders during a crisis management would be : do you front it and manage it , or do you hide ? <p> In a normal operating environment , corporate leaders would be inspiring and leading . This demand from the leadership has not changed ; leaders must still inspire , but in a different way . <p> Leaders must be clear , transparent , and action-oriented to pull on a different set of skills through the Covid-19 crisis .

For this reason , shortly after hearing that the virus had entered South Africa , our regional support office sent out Recommended Covid-19 Operational Guidelines and asked all our offices to shift business practices to virtual channels as far as possible as to minimise the spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our regional support office a full week before the rest of the country went into lockdown . <p> When I first heard of the lockdown , I commended the president for taking such a proactive stance . To this day , I believe that it is the most responsible course of action . Even though it is putting strain on our business and the greater economy , I have always believed that , as business owners and entrepreneurs , it is our duty to support this decision while doing what we can to keep our economy afloat by planning for business continuity after this period of isolation is over . <p> Comment on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on your company or economy as a whole . <p> Goslett : One would expect that the number of sales associates would shrink considering that no agent in the country can earn a single cent in sales commission right now because transactions have to be processed by the Deeds Office , which was closed in during lockdown ( level five ) . However , we 've had a net growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had 46 agents rejoin us over this time . Now more than ever , the backing of a well-established brand becomes invaluable to agents who are struggling to make ends meet on their own . <p> How is your company responding to the crisis ? <p> Goslett : The inability to meet with sellers and landlords face to face or show buyers and renters through a home means that the ability to earn an income is almost entirely halted . I have , therefore , taken the decision to cut all RE/MAX SA franchise and agent fees for the month of April by 50% . Although this decision will come at a significant cost to the business and dramatically impact certain services offered by our regional support office , who will also have their salaries cut in May , we feel that it is the right call to make to show solidarity with our people . We are all in this together . So much so that myself and our COO , Amanda Cuba , have cut our salaries by double that of our staff . <p> Goslett : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The opportunity exists in being the one who survives . The reality is that many will not make it through these tough market conditions . If you are able to survive , you will be one of the very few left to offer your services to the public . <p> How have you had to change the way you work ? <p> Goslett : RE/MAX has always been a frontrunner in terms of our advanced technology offering to our agents . We have continued to operate at full capacity , further developing our technology so that our agents can remain productive over this time . Our agents have been innovating and doing whatever they can to conclude successful transactions and property transfers over this time . This includes suggesting digital alternatives , including virtual walk-throughs where possible , digital advertising , face-time video calls and much more . <p> Goslett : There are things real estate professionals can do to minimise the downsides of this situation . Agents should still be following up with clients via virtual tours and face-time conversations , trying to line up as many sales as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the lockdown period is over . To protect buyers who purchase homes over this time , agents can draft OTPs with a suspensive condition that stipulates that the purchase will only go ahead once the home has passed a physical home inspection which can be conducted once the lockdown has been lifted . <p> Agents should also use this time to learn new skills in order to provide a better service to their customers . To this end , we 've released a plethora of online-based training courses , webinars and conference calls so that our agents have the opportunity to upskill and refresh over this time . We have also opened up our internal training platform to the public so that anyone who wants to explore the RE/MAX offering may freely do so . We have also arranged for top-notch speakers to provide free online inspirational talks for both real estate agents and the greater public . These talks will go live every Thursday for four weeks at 10am as of 24 April , via the RE/MAX of Southern Africa YouTube channel and Facebook page . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners , it was pointed out to us that the interest rate cuts have stimulated interest among buyers , as revealed by an increase in ' buy a home ' search terms during this period . However , it is unlikely that this peak in interest will result in too many sales as few South Africans will be able to afford to make such a large investment at this time . Sadly , the earning potential of many has been either directly or indirectly impacted as a result of Covid-19 . The cuts in interest rates are likely to help consumers keep up with their debt repayments rather than allow them to take on new debt . <p> My prediction is that activity within the housing market is going to be slow at best once the lockdown ends and the Deeds Office and all subsidiary services re-open . It will take some time to process the transactions that were already in line before the lockdown started , which means that any new transactions will take longer to be processed and finalised .

We have n't seen any real movement to incrementally open up e-commerce yet , so we do n't really understand what it means .

This , according to Venter , means in essence the online shopping platform will be unable to fulfil deliveries on any non-essential orders . <p> " This has a very adverse knock-on effect for smaller as well as larger businesses using our site to promote stock that they would otherwise have no way to sell . This also means that stock sitting in our warehouse can not be delivered until we reach level three lockdown , " Venter concludes .

@@61850041 <h> Reporting the Covid-19 pandemic 's ever-changing facts <p> IN late March , the World Health Organisation discouraged people from wearing face masks in public unless they were showing flu-like symptoms . Less than a week later , the Centres for Disease Control changed that advice . <p> By Abby Geluso <p> In January , when Covid-19 had just begun to reach the shores of Europe and the Americas , the most widespread advice was to simply wash your hands for 20 seconds . Three months later , one-third of the world 's population is on lockdown . <p> We are living in a reality seemingly pulled from a dystopian science fiction novel . Now , people are scared and looking for answers . With much still unknown about Covid-19 , these answers often are n't readily available . Meanwhile , data and expert advisories change frequently . <p> I spoke to journalists from Vox , Mother Jones and The New York Times about how they report the ever-changing facts of the pandemic . <p> Vox reporter Umair Irfan wrote an article about the dozens of vaccines in the works to combat coronavirus -- just when the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He and two colleagues gathered and reported information from the National Institutes of Health , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , among other institutions and companies working to find a vaccine . <p> Irfan has found his relationships with researchers , scientists and medical professionals valuable for verifying and developing a deeper understanding of the information he 's reporting in an article . This is especially so when working under a deadline . <p> " They 're just as busy as we are , if not more so , " said Irfan , adding : " But for the most part , once you 've built a relationship with a source , people will be more responsive . Good for a quick fact check here and there . " <p> Mother Jones data journalist Sinduja Rangarajan also has found it essential to consult work put out by professionals , saying : " I 've relied a lot more on the work of scientists , epidemiologists and institutions , and their data , instead of collecting data and doing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have time for . " <p> A lot of reporting around Covid-19 includes estimates and projections , from projections of deaths to when economies will reopen . With so many variables influencing numbers , even a seemingly sound prediction might be overturned shortly after it 's made . <p> " Obviously , I try my very best to be as correct as possible . But looking at data sources , I was able to see that the information was n't up-to-date because it was changing so quickly , " said Rangarajan . <p> Rangarajan makes note in her stories of the day the data were collected or predictions were made , and the date they 're being reported . She does n't update her stories every day ; information is changing so rapidly , it just is n't feasible . It 's best to make clear in your stories that the information is always subject to change , she said . <p> For his part , Irfan tends not to rely too heavily on numbers . " I do update stories as information evolves , but because this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use firm numbers unless they 're absolutely necessary to the story , " he said . <p> Rangarajan prioritises transparency in her reporting on the pandemic . " I 'm being very upfront with the reader that this is a particular figure I 've taken from this particular beat , " she said . <p> For example , an early April story she wrote on states ' supplies of hospital beds now includes at the top of the article : The coronavirus is a rapidly developing news story , so some of the content in this article might be out of date . <p> " If there 's something significant , I let my readers know . But I think the most important thing is that they know what they are looking at . Where did I get that number from ? Is it from today ? From what source ? And just being very , very transparent , " said Rangarajan . <p> Emma Goldberg , a researcher at The New York Times , concurred : " I am making sure to rely on the most informed , up-to-date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also important for reporters to be clear about the limits of our own knowledge of what 's to come in this fast-changing situation .

As journalists , we are working in an unprecedented , prolonged period of constantly changing information . This being the case , our duty to report facts with transparency remains as critical as ever . <p> " I 'm very aware of the fact that this is one of the stories that we are going to continue to report on for a while , even after everything is under control , " said Rangarajan , adding : " Right now , the value we can add is to start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how it 's changing and reporting on that .

@@61858141 <p> TOPLINE -- Boris Johnson 's plan to ease restrictions in England has raised a fresh set of questions about worker safety and the timing of his new " stay alert " message , and has set the U.K. prime minister on a collision course with devolved nations Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland who are insisting their residents " stay at home " to beat coronavirus . <p> KEY FACTS <p> Johnson addressed the U.K. on Sunday night to announce a slight easing of restrictions in England , but saying it was not time to end the lockdown this week . <p> He unveiled a new message of " Stay alert , control the virus , save lives " , but the message is at odds with Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland who are sticking with the original message of " Stay home , protect the NHS , save lives .

Secondary school pupils who have key exams next year could " get time with their teachers " before breaking for summer . <p> BUSINESS : A phased reopening of shops could begin as early as June 1 , while hotels and restaurants could open on July 1 at the earliest " provided they enforce social distancing , " Johnson said . <p> LEISURE : People in England were told they can have an unlimited amount of daily exercise and can play sports in parks with the same members of their household .

@@61861341 <h> Sport is mentioned in terms of restrictions relating to lockdown regulations , but there has been no rescue package for the entire industry . <p> A staggering 83.7% of sports federations surveyed by the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee ( Sascoc ) believe they wo n't survive longer than six months under the current Covid-19 lockdown restrictions . <p> That is one of the bleak pictures to emerge from respondents to Sascoc 's SA Sport Day Zero survey , as the umbrella body attempts to build a picture of the state of sport in the country under the coronavirus pandemic . <p> Almost all of the sports federations surveyed could be classed as " small sports " and have different business models compared to the big three of football , rugby and cricket , which have billion-rand balance sheets . <p> While those three sports were included in the survey , they are worlds apart from the likes of gymnastics , hockey or badminton . A sizable 49 of 76 sports federations responded to the survey , which revealed a bleak picture for the sports industry . <p> The most glaring number in the survey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in six months from the date of the initial lockdown on 27 March this year . <p> But more worryingly , 30.6% could only survive for another two to three months unless there is a return to play , or some meaningful government funding . <p> Almost all those that responded ( 89.8% ) , believe that the national government should be doing more to assist federations during the pandemic . The survey revealed that the best form of relief would come in two ways -- more funding from the government ( 42.9% ) and an earlier return to play ( 34.7% ) . <p> Major sports with big budgets can absorb the current situation -- for now -- as most of their income is derived from the sale of broadcast rights . Those deals are under strain , but there is a dialogue between football , cricket and rugby and their broadcast partners and they have the wherewithal to survive for longer . <p> Smaller sports , as the survey showed , rely mainly on affiliation fees , lottery grants and event earnings as their major sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension of all organised sport under the government 's Covid-19 restrictions . <p> Sascoc should be the voice of those sports federations carrying the urgent message to national government about the need to save sports federations . But Sascoc is beset with infighting and is currently embroiled in aleadership battle , which has all but paralysed the organisation . <p> It has left most sports federations feeling isolated . Several administrators have privately expressed their lack of confidence in Sascoc to Daily Maverick while there is also concern that the sports industry has not been directly addressed in government communication . <p> Sport is mentioned in terms of restrictions relating to lockdown regulations , but there has been no rescue package for the entire industry . <p> Last month , President Cyril Ramaphosa detailed the establishment of a R150-million fund for individual athletes and members of the arts industry , but that was allocated on a case-by-case basis . There were also strict criteria for athletes to qualify for the relief package . <p> " Only athletes who were confirmed to participate at events that have now been cancelled or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through specific sporting events , " could apply , according to the wording by the Department of Sport , Art and Culture . <p> Last week Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa revealed thatonly 93 athletes had been helped -- each receiving a R20,000 grant . Applications for relief have also been closed and it 's unclear if the full budget was used . <p> It was welcome funding for individuals , but the small allocation is primarily aimed at elite athletes . The entire industry employs thousands of people directly and indirectly . <p> Value of sports industry difficult to quantify <p> Tax records give an indication of sports federations ' earnings and expenses but it does n't measure the economic impact on those indirectly suffering due to sports ' hiatus . The exact value of the SA sports industry is difficult to quantify . <p> A report by accounting firm PWC put the value of the SA sports industry at R15.285-billion in 2016 . That metric measured five key criteria -- gate revenue , media ( broadcast ) rights , sponsorships , merchandising and sports betting . It did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater sporting orbit . <p> In tennis , for example , there are hundreds of coaches nationally who work at schools and clubs who have been unemployed since the lockdown began . That is not reflected in Tennis South Africa 's financial statements . <p> Golf is similar -- hundreds of club pros and thousands of caddies across the country have been unable to make a living since lockdown began . <p> In bigger sports , indirect beneficiaries of sports events such as vendors , security personnel , media , grounds staff , caterers and a host of other satellite industries have lost most of their work . These are all intricately connected to the sporting ecosystem . <p> Both tennis and golf have established their own funds to assist members , but both are falling well short of their needs to keep their industries afloat at a grassroots level . The long-term picture for sport is bleak if the majority of coaches in different codes are forced out of the greater sporting industry . <p> Tennis South Africa and Golf RSA have both made strong representations to Mthethwa for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " While Tennis SA recognises that public safety must remain the number one priority during this national crisis , our concern is that a blanket approach to regulating sport in the current Covid-19 environment , will severely damage the ecosystems of many sporting codes in this country , " Tennis SA said in a15-page proposal to the government . <p> " As such , we believe that increased attention must be given to understanding the differences between team and individual sports , as well as contact versus non-contact sports . This proposal makes the case that tennis ( as well as other non-contact , individual sports ) needs to be considered as a low-risk activity , in the context of the national risk-adjusted strategy . <p> " Tennis is an individual and non-contact sport and so poses a much lower risk of transmission . In South Africa it is played outdoors , normally with only two people on the court . The distance from baseline to baseline on the court is 23.77m . <p> " In Italy , one of the country 's leading universities -- Politecnico di Torino -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to release a 400-page report detailing its findings about which sports are safest in a coronavirus pandemic environment . <p> " The study lists 387 sport disciplines that have been categorised from 0 to 4 depending on the risk of Covid-19 spread . On this scale , 0 represents non-existent risk , 1 : weak risk , 2 : medium risk , 3 : high risk , and 4 : very high risk . Among the factors considered are the conditions for training , competition and public presence . According to the study , sports that fall into the 0 category , with ' almost no possibility ' of spreading the infection , are disciplines such as sailing , open water swimming , golf , and tennis . " <p> South African sport though , seemingly remains a peripheral issue in the overall strategy in the fight against Covid-19 even though thousands , possibly hundreds of thousands of livelihoods are at stake if the lockdown continues . <p> The DA waded into the arena , demanding that some sports be allowed to resume . <p> " The DA is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like swimming , tennis , golf , athletics and others , without the presence of spectators , is possible if strict hygiene and Covid-19 protocols are in place , " DA shadow minister for sport Tsepo Mhlongo said . <p> " Many athletes were prevented from applying for relief assistance due to the department 's inefficiencies and have lost their last opportunity to access some sort of a lifeline . Since the department is refusing to give them a second chance to access financial assistance , the right thing to do is to reopen non-contact sports codes where possible . " <p> Sascoc has a poor governance record , but by conducting this survey there has been an acknowledgement that sport needs to measure its problem so that it can make a stronger case for funding and relief .

Two Native American tribes are in trouble . They live in the Hopi and Navajo reservations that span parts of Arizona , Utah and New Mexico in the South Western United States .

According to Cassandra Begay , communications director for the fundraiser , donations from Ireland have been ' phenomenal ' . Comments from many of the Irish donors indicate that they have recalled the Choctaw contribution to Irish famine victims and it has inspired them to respond to the current campaign . Sean Callahan , an Apple administrator in Cork , stated : " I 'd already known what the Choctaw did in the Famine , so short a time after they 'd been through the Trail of Tears .

Over 15,000 walked to their new destination in a march that became known as the Trail of Tears . Up to 4,000 people died on route . In their new home they faced hostility . In a contemporary account , a member of the community said : " Our habitations were torn down and burned , our fences destroyed , cattle turned into our fields , and we ourselves have been scourged , manacled , fettered and otherwise personally abused , until by such treatment some of our best men have died .

From their meagre resources they gathered $170 , more than $5,000 in today 's money , for the beleaguered Irish people.Relationships between Ireland and the Choctaw people have been copperfastened in recent years .

The only real assets that the country had left of any worth were its land and natural resources . So it pledged these on long term mortgages and liens as guarantees on direct loans and other longer term financing instruments ( from both governments and private enterprises ) to get the balance of the money needed .

I am very aware of the treacherous path our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we navigate ( from early-April ) the **26;1167;TOOLONG ( so-called ' exponential growth ' ) phase . <p> My question is this : is the stretch from a FDR New Deal and the glaring current folly ( not to mention the pre-Covid stuff ) and the most immediate challenges which we face re the economy that requires daily bold and decisive action may be not expecting a bit too much ? I was incredibly exited by the ' social compact ' trigger when President Ramaphosa and SA leaders stepped up to the plate during the initial phase of the pandemic impact ( and retain space for this outcome beyond Covid ) . My concern , however , is that the opening-up of the economy ( ' flattening the recession curve ' ) now requires even stronger social compact/ cooperation and bold and decisive action compared to that demanded thus far in ' flattening the epidemic curve ' . With the latter we have demonstrated success ( the President 's quoting of the counter factual last night is spot-on ) . However , I do not see much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ( rightfully ) taking the government to court instead -- they were boots-and-all part of the initial ' compact ' . As an economist I will also want to put it that if we do not move with speed NOW we will not have an economy to reside over and drive recovery . Trust business leaders and transfer responsibility in managing the Covid threats to worker health . This is the only way we can lock-in the gains made thus far and ensure sustained success , which will really set SA up for recovery . Without social compact all is bound to end in tears . Maybe I will be positively surprised ( over the past decade the reality has been diagonally opposite , including last night ) . I note that informed Saffers appreciate the President 's apologies re the government 's mistakes and there are the current negotiations re phase 3 underway . Again , revived ' social agreement ' towards the end of this month will be too late . The economy 's current implosion ( importantly more to do the pre-Covid condition ) is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implosion . And then , social compact can only be revived by decisive action directed at the economy , not towards any political party or sectional interest .

Aircraft performance in the upgraded Phenom has also been boosted , with the PW535E1-powered twin delivering a high-speed cruise of 464kt ( 859km/h ) -- 11kt faster than the current 300E -- and a range with five occupants of 2,010nm -- 38nm further than its predecessor . <p> In the cabin , the airframer has introduced the option of the premium Bossa Nova Edition interior that made its debut on the Praetor 500 and 600 . <p> Embraer 's next move is unclear .

@@61872541 <h> DOCUMENTS <h> Ramaphosa must defend NDZ -- RET Gauteng <p> Zuma support group says Minister is under attack for simply having carried out her duties <p> The Gauteng RET President Zuma Support Group urges President Cyril Ramaphosa to defend Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and calls for unity in the ANC <p> 5 May 2020 <p> The Gauteng RET President Zuma Support Group is appalled by the persistent patriarchal and sexist attacks that are being directed at Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma , the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs . <p> Dr. Dlamini Zuma is under attack for simply having carried out her duties as the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs ( COGTA ) who , in terms of the Disaster Management Act of 2020 , has the responsibility to coordinate our country 's national disaster mitigation efforts . The fact that these attacks by the cigarette and tobacco industry , because she announced the collective decision of the National Corona Virus Command Council ( NCVCC ) that the ban of the sale of cigarettes and tobacco related products is upheld , are framed in the most vile sexist and mysoginist language is deplorable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RET President Zuma Support Group concurs with the outrage expressed by the ANC Women 's League ( ANCWL ) about such sexist abuse , which is a disturbing indication of how deeply rooted sexism and patriarchy are still in our South African society . <p> We also agree with the statement that the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association ( MKMVA ) issued yesteday , on Monday the 4th of May , that the attacks on Dr. Dlamini Zuma are intended to undermine the capability of Cabinet and the NCVCC to effectively function as a collective , with as the ultimate target to undermine unity in the African National Congress ( ANC ) . <p> With this understanding in mind , we urge our Cabinet and the NCVCC to act with integrity and courage , and to publicly accept their collective responsibility for the decisions that they have taken <p> and which Dr. Dlamini Zuma announced on their behalf . Silence , or even a muted response , in the face of the terrible personal attacks on Dr. Dlamini Zuma , and the obvious attempts to drive wedges between our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is particularly true for our President , comrade Cyril Ramaphosa , who chairs both Cabinet and the NCVCC . <p> The fake narrative that is being peddled by British American Tobacco SA ( BAT-SA ) , and their fellow White Monopoly Capitalists ( WMC ) , as they try to to isolate and target Dr. Dlamini Zuma , is that she undermined the authority of the President . Nothing can be further from the truth ! <p> However , unfortunately what is sadly beginning to undermine the authority and integrity of our President , is his silence up to now , and his failure to condemn the malicious sexist and racist attacks on Dr. Dlamini Zuma . <p> We are in the midst of one of the most serious challenges - if not the most serious - that our young nation ever faced . We need our President , who leads our collective national effort to overcome the coronavirus pandemic , to defend his colleagues as their Commander in Chief in this struggle for the survival of our nation , and at all times to act with courage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on comrade President Ramaphosa , and as his fellow ANC comrades we plead with him not fail us , nor himself , with regards to the serious challenge that this situation poses . <p> In doing so we join MKMVA and the ANCWL , as they have done in their respective statements , in applauding the excellent work done by Cabinet and the NCVCC , under the leadership of President Ramaphosa , to protect our nation from the spread of the the COVID19 virus , and to flatten the curve of infection . <p> We are confident that this excellent work will and must continue , but this is obviously dependant on all of us closing ranks , defending each other and the unity of the ANC . We must resist the malicious efforts of White Monopoly Capitalists ( WMC ) who are determined to try and divide us in their callous pursuit of profit at the cost of the safety of our nation , and the very lives of our people . <p> The coronavirus pandemic , and the resultant lockdown , has further highlighted , and intensified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the majority of poor black ( especially African ) South Africans are faced with a life and death struggle just to get food and shelter . <p> The current crisis confronts us with the inescapable fact that , once we have overcome the coronavirus pandemic , we will have to restructure our society fundamentally differently . It can never again be " business as usual " . We will need to rebuild , and in the process radically restructure , our economy to empower the majority of black poor , in order to become an equal , and truly just , society . Principled unity , imbued by our collective determination to succeed , will be of paramount importance . <p> Issued by Carl Niehaus on behalf of the Gauteng RET President Zuma Support Group , 5 May 2020
@@61873241 <h> Maverick Citizen Op-Ed <h> Why the release of 19,000 prisoners is a good thing <h> The government 's decision to release thousands of low-risk offenders due to Covid-19 pressures in SA 's prisons met with mixed reactions . Many saw this as contradictory to the punitive , rather than restorative , response that is being applied through the criminalisation of the lockdown laws . We are concerned that this may discredit the very notion of restorative justice . <p> As organisations that actively support the concept of restorative justice , and have provided services in this field for many years , we applaud the release of 19,000 inmates on parole . In particular , we appreciate the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services ' reaffirmation of government 's commitment to restorative justice , and for emphasising that both victims and offenders need assistance . <p> The Detention Justice Forum has sent an open letter to the minister regarding the decision to release the inmates . The full text of the letter can be found here . <p> The context into which these inmates will be released is , of course , an even harsher one than usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 . In many cases , these people will be experienced by their families and communities as adding to the burden of survival . Furthermore , these unusually adverse socio-economic conditions , together with the marginalisation and stigmatisation ex-offenders typically experience after release , increases their risk of reoffending . This does not detract in any way from the necessity of the minister 's decision and the responsible way in which he has chosen to implement it . <p> The potential of restorative justice processes becomes clear at this point . National and international research has indicated that restorative justice is effective not only in addressing relational harm between victims and offenders , as well as between offenders and broader communities , but also in reducing the likelihood of reoffending . <p> We share a deep concern , however , that in reality the capability to provide restorative justice services has become significantly depleted due to a lack of real support for many years . The National Policy Framework appears to have been stalled since 2015 and funding of services in this field has dwindled dramatically over the past 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediation and dialogue and other restorative approaches , most victims are unlikely to participate in any meaningful interaction with offenders during the release process . <p> Noting some of the cynical responses to the minister 's announcement about the release , many people will , in the current environment , see the release as contradictory to the punitive , rather than restorative , response that seems to be applied through the criminalisation of the lockdown regulations . We are concerned that this may discredit the very notion of restorative justice . <p> We know that excessive reliance on a punitive approach and imprisonment is ineffective . We support the State 's decision to implement a restorative justice system , and believe that now is the time to begin to shape a new criminal justice system that is truly based on the values of restorative justice , that holds offenders accountable in constructive rather than destructive ways and takes the needs of victims and society seriously . <p> We as a network of organisations , practitioners and academics would be keen to engage with the State further on the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly restorative approach provides tangible experiences of respect and care in the administration of justice . Our proposal to the minister is that he consider harnessing organisations and practitioners such as ourselves , and others , to prioritise special support for both victims and offenders being released at this time , which could include mediation and dialogue . <p> Further , we propose that the Department of Community Services call on the assistance of organisations and groups working with released offenders to assist with reintegration . An amendment to the National Lotteries Commission Relief Covid-19 Fund to allow organisations currently in receipt of a grant for other projects to access funding for this purpose , as well as releasing other sources of direct funding , would be tangible ways of supporting the concept .

@@61878041 <h> How to pandemic-proof your business <p> When a virtual session of South Africa 's parliamentary proceedings was hijacked and flooded with pornographic images in early May , it made headlines around the world . <p> This was not the first time a parliamentary meeting has suffered from malicious disruptions . <p> There have been many other hacking instances of hastily-adopted video-conferencing systems that enable remote working and teaching -- to the point where some universities and schools have banned the use of at least one of the most popular of these platforms , Zoom , because of security fears . <p> The problem , says Denis Bensch , CIO of FlowCentric Technologies , is not necessarily the technology , but lack of preparedness and planning in using that technology . <p> " The time between the first rumblings about COVID-19 and lockdowns was incredibly short -- less than three months . Suddenly , distant digitisation objectives had to be implemented immediately . It 's not surprising that things have gone wrong , " he adds . <p> The world of work as we knew it in 2019 and early 2020 has gone forever . In a Gartner survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 2020 , nearly three-quarters stated they intended to move at least some of their employees to remote work permanently post the current pandemic . <p> " This data is an example of the lasting impact the current coronavirus crisis will have on the way companies do business , " said Alexander Bant , practice vice-president , research for the Gartner Finance Practice . <p> A second Gartner survey conducted just a few days later revealed that nearly 50% of all responding organisations reported that over 81% of their workforce was operating remotely during the coronavirus pandemic . In addition , the study showed that 41% of workers were planning to continue working remotely more often in the future . <p> " Global crises and events have always changed the world . For example , the cold war with its threat of nuclear warfare was one of the underlying motivations for DARPA to develop the Internet -- a network that was n't situated in one place and could survive a nuclear attack , " Bensch says . <p> " COVID-19 is teaching us that we must be able to conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods are n't sustainable . Many organisations have come to realise , remarkably quickly , that working from home is actually a viable option . Work from home plans are now a reality for most organisations , even those whose digitisation plans pre-COVID-19 might have balked at anything more than online purchasing and payments . " <p> According to Bensch , while COVID-19 is driving us to work from home , business must be resilient enough , at all levels , to function in today 's and tomorrow 's pandemic-altered world by considering the following : <p> Customers : Can they continue to do business with us if they ca n't walk into our store front ? <p> Operations : Can they continue to deliver if they are n't allowed to travel or go to work ? <p> Finance : Can they continue to pay suppliers and collect money owed without going into the office ? <p> Suppliers : Can our suppliers keep us supplied in a time of crisis ? <p> He also warns that , as the few reported hacking incidents have illustrated , there are many operational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Allowing remote workers onto your network is not as simple as installing a VPN ( virtual private network ) system .

Almost overnight they had to change their entire modus operandi to remote working . <p> As a result , many companies rushed to sign up for platforms and services in the days before lockdown in order to keep their businesses going . <p> Now that it is clear the lockdown is going to continue for months , and social distancing is likely to be with us for a lot longer , companies need to evaluate these hastily implemented services and platforms ; and take steps to improve their effectiveness . <p> Bensch offers the following advice for the evaluation and remediation process : <p> Do n't panic . Work with your IT department which , after all , is meant to be the enabler for the company vision . Do n't sign up for " grey " or shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have systems in place when the lockdown started , take a structured approach to working on this . Remember , your IT department is also under serious pressure at the moment . <p> Look at your processes carefully . Determine whether relatively low-risk activities such as leave , shared document repositories and so on can be provisioned while in lockdown . <p> Think about collaboration-type activities such as meetings , project coordination and research , and which of the many tools available in these areas are best for your needs . <p> Consider making changes to high-risk and money-related activities ( such as paying suppliers or getting paid by customers ) and critical core activities of your business at a later stage , when things have settled or when it is more feasible to do so . These processes need to be carefully defined and the implementations tested and signed off . However , this can not be postponed forever . <p> Think of your suppliers . It does n't help if your business can continue as normal , but your suppliers ca n't . Talk to your suppliers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown state , in an era of social distancing and and during other future crises . <p> If you still have beer , go get one and sit and think about how you are going to implement a business process management system that will enable you to work from anywhere . <p> " Whether your inability to access systems is owing to COVID-19 , load-shedding or a chemical spill , it will always be in your best interest to allow your business to continue operating as normal no matter where employees , suppliers and customers are based . When the correct processes and control measures are put in place , remote operations can actually work effectively , efficiently and securely , " Bensch concludes .

Over the next year it is anticipated it will assess the government 's response to the pandemic . <p> Daly says in his opening statement it was known early on that people in homes would be " amongst the most susceptible " . <p> Stories from overseas emerged early in the year regarding the devastating impact the virus had on older persons in residential care settings , states Daly , adding that in January NHI had begun its engagement with nursing homes to provide Covid-specific guidance . <p> In February " concerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 education and guidance for nursing homes . <p> Guidance from the Department of Health to provide dedicated guidance for residential care settings was also sought . <p> On Friday 6 March , a decision to restrict visitors to nursing homes was made , which Daly states was informed by their nursing committee , which comprises of clinical experts representing nursing homes across the country . <p> It was a decision " not taken lightly , " says Daly . <p> At the NPHET briefing of 10 March , " the decision was taken to publicly challenge the decision to restrict visitors as premature " . <p> " This is despite Hiqa , presented as the representative voice for our sector at NPHET , announcing that same day it would suspend visits by its inspectors to hospitals , citing the safety and wellbeing of people using services and staff . <p> " Two days later -- 12th March -- it cancelled inspections of all social care services . " <p> Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan has previously stressed that officials do not believe , based on the data , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed earlier this week that Hiqa received multiple allegations of outsiders entering nursing homes during the first two months of the Covid-19 outbreak despite visiting restrictions . <p> Since the beginning of the outbreak , criticisms have been made as to why action was n't taken sooner to safeguard those living in nursing homes . <p> According to Daly the first specific guidance regarding nursing home care management was only issued on 23 March , weeks into the national emergency . <p> Throughout the public health crisis , private nursing homes not under public ownership , have raised concerns about the lack of funding available for the purchase of personal protective equipment needed in nursing homes . <p> The State has since stepped in to help provide this equipment to the private sector . <p> While the Department of Health eventually intervened , Daly says key State organisations left the nursing home sector and its residents isolated in those early days . <p> " The dismay will live forever with us . " <p> A number of mistakes were made , says Daly , including the insufficient testing of residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He adds that there was also an aggressive recruitment of nursing home staff initially by the HSE . As the crisis emerged , a massive recruitment drive got underway for medical and healthcare workers to help in Irish hospitals -- but as a result there have been criticisms since that such actions decreased the level of staff working in Ireland 's nursing homes . <p> Discharging from hospitals <p> Daly will also highlight the discharging from acute hospitals to nursing homes without testing at the outset of the public health emergency in March . <p> HSE boss Paul Reid said last week that there is " no evidence whatsoever " that Covid-19 infection spread into Ireland 's nursing homes by the discharge of elderly people into nursing homes in March . <h> Related Read <p> However , Holohan said " the reality is any form of movement of people in and out of any setting increases the risk of transmission of this infection " . <p> " And if there 's movement of individuals in and out of nursing homes and longterm residential care facilities happening , that can increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee today : <p> " We were exasperated .

" <p> While he said nursing homes had huge levels of experience in managing the outbreak of flu and norovirus every winter and have extensive experience and clinical expertise in implementing infection prevention control measures , the global pandemic was on a " different scale to any previously encountered in the sector " . <p> Daly will also tell the committee that lessons can be learned from the closer engagement brought upon by Covid-19 . <p> " There is requirement for a better and more integrated working relationship between the State and our sector .

This issue was raised in the D ? il last week by Fine Gael 's Fergus O'Dowd , who said that the percentage of compliance was down from 27% in 2017 to 23% in 2018 . <p> Quinn will also tell the committee today that currently 80% of nursing homes are operated by private providers , despite being largely funded through the Nursing Home Support Scheme also known as the Fair Deal Scheme . <p> " The HSE did not know this sector .

@@61888841 <h> Tanzanians of all backgrounds need to come to the realisation that their current government is not interested in protecting them and putting their interests first . <p> Last week , I addressed Tanzanian citizens via online platforms about the real status of the Covid-19 pandemic in our country . This follows the continuing failure of President John Magufuli to demonstrate any leadership or concern for Tanzanians during this great crisis . <p> President Magufuli 's continued dismissal of advice from scientists , medical professionals , civil society and political party leaders has helped drive the spread of the coronavirus in Tanzania and contributed to the deaths of many citizens . His handling of Tanzania 's response to the pandemic has been the epitome of incompetence . <p> At this time , Tanzanians of all backgrounds need to come to the realisation that their current government is not interested in protecting them and putting their interests first . It is up to individuals now to take all measures to protect themselves and their families against the rampant spread of the coronavirus . Our government has left us alone . <p> It appears that President Magufuli and his government are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be equated to a Darwinian " survival of the fittest " , a significant gamble which may kill hundreds of thousands of immuno-compromised Tanzanians . <p> The government remains completely silent though on exactly what approach it is following and why . The last official statistics on the rate of Covid-19 infections and deaths were issued on 29 April . Since then , Tanzanians have endured radio silence from those elected to lead them . Apparently , statistics have not been released because the president questioned the integrity of tests conducted by the National Health Laboratory , infamously claiming that goats and papaya could be found by the test to be positive for Covid-19 . Despite the formation of a committee to investigate the National Health Laboratory , no reports or updates have been forthcoming . Instead , the president has dispatched officials to pursue a questionable and already discredited Madagascan herbal remedy . <p> Tanzania 's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic is also pitting our country against our close neighbours as well as our historical and strategic allies . The decision by the president to not attend recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk that we could get sidelined by our neighbours as we increasingly become a regional and international pariah . <p> We must hold President Magufuli and his government to account as responsibly and vigorously as we can . Tanzanians must take records of their beloved ones who die of coronavirus so that these records can be used to demand justice for them . <p> In the absence of any evidence to the contrary , we have to assume that the government 's foolish and dangerous herd immunity approach is a poor attempt to protect the economy . Yet , the government 's own statistics show that the economy is in bad shape and the international impact of the pandemic is worsening the economic outlook for Tanzania on an almost daily basis . The drop in revenue collection by 50% in March shows how badly the pandemic is affecting our economy -- the government expected to collect Sh460-billion ( R3.45-billion ) but ended up collecting only Sh224-billion ( R1.68-billion ) . <p> Despite claims that we are winning the battle against the pandemic , the government has applied for emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . Unfortunately , our application was rejected because of inaccurate statistics relating to the budget that was provided by the government . It has also been troubling to see the criticism of the Tanzanian government by the World Bank for hiding commercial loans , a practice contrary to World Bank rules and regulations . This dubious financial management can only be further compromising Tanzania 's fight against the Covid-19 pandemic . <p> Fundamentally , the government needs to stop treating the Covid-19 pandemic as a national security issue and start treating it as a public health issue that has serious consequences for the economic and social well-being of our nation . Not only does the government hide the information from the public but it has unleashed a vicious propaganda machine . This has gone hand in hand with the government 's suppression of the independent press , intimidation of healthcare workers so that they can not share the real situation on the ground as well as the removal of coronavirus patients from hospitals and thus letting them attempt to recuperate -- and die -- at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allow the government to play with their health and lives . We must hold President Magufuli and his government to account as responsibly and vigorously as we can . Tanzanians must take records of their beloved ones who die of coronavirus so that these records can be used to demand justice for them . <p> The Tanzanian government has abandoned its constitutional duty to protect Tanzanian citizens . It therefore lacks legitimacy to remain in power . Change is needed and will be arriving this coming October . When the polls open on Election Day , it will be our chance to hold the governing party and its irresponsible leader to account . It is our patriotic duty and we best not abandon it .

But it was nothing that a decent throat spray and some over the counter medication could n't sort out and within a few days I was as right as rain and joining the long queue of non social distancing art lovers to catch a brief glimpse of the Mona Lisa . Ah ... those were the days . <p> STEADYPAYWALL <p> Now , of course , I only travel down the sharp end where there 's considerably more social distancing on offer and an altogether better class of infection to be had . <p> I 've lived dangerously , exchanging body fluids with people I barely knew at university and not always washing my hands for at least 20 seconds after . If I 'd known I was flirting with death I never would have done it . Before I even knew the word ' pathogens ' I was eating street food in Vietnam , drinking in crowded bars in New York and , can you credit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London ? <p> Once I even performed as a member of the choir at the Royal Albert Hall in a performance of Edward Elgar 's sublime ' Dream of Gerontius ' . Can you believe it ? A full orchestra , seventy members of the choir and an audience capacity of plus or minus 5200 . How on earth I got through that I 'll never know but I was younger then and had none of these appallingly named ' comorbidities ' which makes we elderly folk so vulnerable now . <p> On a visit to Japan to attend a car launch I stopped off in Taiwan on the way home and visited a street market . One of the food stalls had snakes hanging up and the touristy thing to do was to drink a shooter of snake bile . The unfortunate serpent would be slit lengthwise and the bile drained off and collected in a small cup ready for drinking . The claimed benefits were many and included a vastly enhanced performance between the sheets I was assured . <p> I 'm afraid I chickened out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead . I must have been mad , although some of the very friendly young women who approached me in the market looked far more dangerous to my health than a shooter cup of snake bile . <p> Many of the places I 've visited over the years have not been famous for their hygiene and even in pre handover Hong Kong there were food stalls at street level selling things that had obviously once been living creatures but were unidentifiable to a fastidious western tourist . Deep fried though they were delicious . <p> In a villa I rented in Morocco the local butcher would display his wares on a marble slab in the open air with the sun beating down and swarms of flies keen for a nibble of flesh . It was the job of the butcher 's assistant to wave some sort of whisk around to deter the flies but I 'm willing to bet that a good number landed , laid eggs and moved on .

Even if the lockdown is lifted I shall be continuing with a risk averse voluntary lockdown from now on . <p> No more live concerts for me , no more hanging around in bars chatting up attractive young women who are almost certainly riddled with some or other easily transmittable affliction and definitely no more passing of zols at the croquet club .

If I have learned anything from COVID-19 it is that the grim reaper lurks in the most unexpected places . <p> However , now it 's permitted I may venture out to a liquor retailer suitably attired in my hazmat suit next week and buy a bottle or two of whisky .

@@61891341 <h> Concern as overcrowding returns to Ireland 's emergency departments <p> The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine has expressed serious concerns for patient and staff health as Emergency Department crowding returns . <p> Figures released today from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation show that 50 people are now waiting for medical treatment on trollies at A&amp;E departments across the country . The numbers continue to rise as more and more non-Covid related cases present at the facilities . <p> In a statement , the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine said : " At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions the number of patients attending Ireland 's Emergency Departments ( EDs ) fell significantly , as did the number of admissions from EDs . A recent ESRI report containing figures to the end of March ( and therefore covering just the first few weeks of significant restrictions ) confirms this . <p> " The experience during April &amp; May has been that patients have begun to attend EDs in numbers comparable to a typical April or May . Unfortunately , this increase in numbers has also seen the return of the phenomenon of EDs being forced to lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is complete but who are forced to wait on hospital trolleys in EDs until an acute hospital bed is available for them ) . This is most evident in Limerick and Cork but many other hospitals are on the verge of seeing this scenario return . <p> " At a time when the advice to the public is of the vital need to ensure physical distancing with a minimum separation of 2m between healthy people , it is absolutely indefensible that crowding be allowed to occur in an ED . This is all the more unacceptable as many patients attending EDs are acutely unwell ; are often elderly and commonly have comorbidities . These groups are at markedly increased risk of dying from COVID-19 infection . <p> " The ED is a workplace for its staff who are entitled to the same protections from harm that apply in other work environments . Not alone is the return of crowding and inpatient boarders in an on-going COVID pandemic a very significant risk to patients ( and magnifies the already well-established risks of ED crowding ) , it also risks staff contracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the consequent shortage of trained personnel . <p> " The public is well aware that many Nursing Homes &amp; long term care facilities became significant reservoirs for Covid-19 infection and many still require significant on-going support to address this . It would be unconscionable that EDs be allowed to become the next major reservoir of Covid-19 infection with catastrophic results for patients and staff alike . <p> " It is therefore imperative that the National Public Health Emergency Team ( NPHET ) and Health Service management recognise this very significant risk and take immediate steps to prevent crowding in EDs occurring in the first place . These steps involve measures to tackle inflow of patients into the ED by the provision of realistic and acceptable options for patients and GPs when a patient 's condition does not require immediate attention ; throughput of patients in a space that is adequate for the numbers presenting and supported by prioritised access to the requirements for rapid senior decision making ( e.g. Radiology and Laboratory diagnostics , as needed ) and egress from EDs ( e.g. available beds for those requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose safe discharge depends on it ) . <p> " The Association is currently working on a series of high-level recommendations which should inform this significant change in service delivery .

Dated : 5/5/2020 12:11:20 AM <p> On the World Press Freedom Day , India has slipped on the global press freedom index.Reporters Without Borders has ranked it at 142 out of 180 countries , in light of recent attacks on journalists and scholars under a right wing Hindu nationalist Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) government led by Narendra Modi.What could be more shameful for a country that claims to be the world 's largest democracy than this ? The news follows the recent incidents of slapping criminal charges against several journalists in different parts of the country in an attempt to suppress the voice of dissent and right to question.Only last month , well-respected columnist Anand Teltumbde was sent to jail on malicious charges for being critical of a government that wants to transform India into a Hindu theocracy and has given legitimacy to those involved in violence against religious minorities and other oppressed communities.Teltumbde has joined a few more thinkers already rotting in prisons . Among them is disabled Delhi University Professor G.N. Saibaba , who is suffering with 19 ailments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice against repression of minorities and state violence . Not only have the Indian government and its courts refused to set them free on humanitarian grounds , in spite of a grave threat of COVID 19 in overcrowded jails , they have ordered the arrests of others , such as Teltumbde.Ironically , the Modi government had recently started the broadcasting of Ramayan - a TV serial based on the epic of Lord Ram , a revered Hindu god - to entertain Indian masses locked in their homes because of COVID 19 . It is believed that Ram was the King of Ayodhya . Episode 13 of the serial ( posted on youtube ) shows that when Ram was designated as the king , his father had advised him to be respectful of scholars and intellectuals as they are like " guiding lights " and accept their criticism with an open mid.However , Modi 's government is doing exactly the opposite , despite its advocacy for a Hindu nation . After all , the BJP has been campaigning for years to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya . The party supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1992 . They have been claiming that the mosque was forcibly built on the birthplace of Ram by the Islamic rulers after demolishing a Hindu temple . Ram has become a rallying point for BJP to polarize Hindu majority.In complete contradiction of its own politics that revolves around Ram , this government is throwing scholars in jails , let alone the question of listening to their concerns . It 's time for the Hindus to step forward and challenge this government which is bent upon using their religion for narrow political ends , and show Modi and his hypocritical cabinet colleagues the mirror . If they really care for Ram , then they must liberate scholars and save democracy ; otherwise , history wo n't ever forget Modi and those who voted him to power in the name of a faith that teaches everyone to see the entire world as one big family. * ( Gurpreet Singh is a journalist )

We 've reported from several districts across states such as Rajasthan , Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh and Punjab . <p> In our travels , two of our own , National Photo Editor Praveen Jain and reporter Simrin Sirur contracted the virus .

It was heartening to see neighbours caring for one another , and pooling in their resources to make sure no one went hungry . <p> The real challenge , though , has been collecting the stories as quickly as possible while reminding others to keep their distance . The process can be nerve-wracking because you never know who carries the virus and who does n't . <h> Neelam Pandey <p> Neelam Pandey ThePrint <p> Apprehension , fear and uncertainty greeted me as I embarked on a journey to Uttar Pradesh from Delhi to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of migrants being beaten up by police at bus stations , or many standing in queues to get food , the enormity of the situation struck me when I saw scores of them walking or cycling over 1,000 km to reach their homes in UP and Bihar . <p> The only food they were carrying were packets of biscuits and water to quench their thirst . Carrying big bags on their heads , they were determined to reach their homes . <p> Along with my colleague and photographer Suraj Singh Bisht , we listened to their ordeal with many complaining of blood oozing out of their blisters . Many even asked us to request the police to not beat them up . <p> While we faced quite a few difficulties in getting accommodation , food and were denied entry to many places , it seemed nothing compared to what these migrant workers were going through . <h> Suraj Singh Bisht <p> Suraj Singh Bisht ThePrint <p> In the past week , I journeyed from Delhi to Agra , on to Lucknow , then Varanasi and I am now heading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the common sight was migrant labourers and workers trudging along on national highways , either on foot or on bicycles , trying to make it back to their villages . <p> We spoke with many of them , only to constantly hear about them starving and worried about money . The lockdown , in one move , left thousands of them without jobs . Many openly wept , talking about how their families were struggling to manage two square meals a day for their children . This was particularly heart wrenching for me to see . <p> We helped some people out by giving them money and whatever food , such as biscuits and fruits , we had . <p> This has been an experience for me to see how quickly life can change . <h> Angana Chakrabarti <p> Angana Chakrabarti ( left ) and Soniya Agarwal ThePrint <p> When my colleague Soniya Agarwal and I arrived in Indore , a city that has among the highest number of cases in India , we found an administration that was scrambling to implement a massive sampling exercise . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in the number of burials in Muslim cemeteries .

While we were determined to reach different spots and report from there , for one of our daily vlogs , we decided to shoot from inside the Union Carbide factory . <p> After a long detour , we finally reached the site , only to be turned away by two guards . They said we would require a written permit from the District Collector .

From then , up until recently when I was at Jahangirpuri in Delhi , another hotspot area , I 've noticed a change in me . I am not longer that afraid , and my paranoia has gradually turned into cautiousness . These experiences helped me change my attitude towards the " invisible enemy " , and I believe I have grown stronger as a journalist . <h> Taran Deol <p> Taran Deol ThePrint <p> I have been working as a journalist for less than a year .

So , the fear loomed large over my head every minute . Despite taking all the recommended precautions , you can never tell when the ' invisible enemy ' will catch hold of you . <h> Swagata Yadavar <p> Swagata Yadavar ThePrint <p> Manisha Mondal and I were among the first journalists from outside the state to reach the industrial town of Bhilwara in the last week of March when it had 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 days , the city was under a strict lockdown and its borders were sealed and each house surveyed for possible suspects .

We saw people from everywhere being uprooted overnight after years of painstaking effort and hard work to build a life in the city . <p> However , what was most unbearable was seeing children and pregnant women , some as advanced as eight months , walk barefoot on the road that was scorched in the sunlight .

@@71916541 <p> The COVID-19 pandemic is a complex global crisis without contemporary precedent . In just about every country around the world , the pandemic response is taking up the bulk of resources , expertise , time and effort . <p> But , how would people and systems cope if a major natural hazard , like an earthquake or a tropical cyclone , occurs while the COVID-19 pandemic continues ? <p> How would people and systems cope if a major natural hazard occurs during COVID-19 ? Picture : Getty Images <p> Our new research combines simple epidemiological models with natural hazard curves to investigate potential scenarios that could eventuate in several different countries , if there were to be a natural disaster . <p> Importantly , it also outlines several strategic steps that governments and disaster management agencies might consider to minimise risks during the pandemic . <h> From bushfires to pandemics <p> In January this year , as devastating bushfires drove thousands of Australians to evacuate their homes , China imposed a lockdown in Hubei province to mitigate the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease we now know as COVID-19 . <p> By the end of the month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged as a global pandemic that by late April , had caused more than 233,000 deaths around the world . <p> A government and agency response to a crisis -- whether it 's bushfires or a pandemic -- is informed by expert knowledge , data , experience and advice about societal exposure and vulnerability to the hazard . <p> In late March , a magnitude 5.3 earthquake hit Zagreb , the capital of Croatia , disrupting newly-introduced lockdown measures . While the full effect of this temporary disruption on COVID-19 infections is yet to be understood in detail , according to our analysis of the data available , there was an apparent increase in the rate of infections in the days following the earthquake . <p> So you have on one hand , according to the initial media and operational reports , the fact that COVID-19 counter measures can hamper the emergency response to disasters like these . Then on the other hand , the disruption to social distancing that can increase the potential for infection . <p> Natural disasters can displace large numbers of people and epidemic diseases often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potential double whammy that governments may have to deal with in the next few months -- maybe years . And preparation is key . <p> To understand the potential impact of a pandemic-natural disaster hybrid scenario , we combined epidemic projection models with natural hazard models to come up with two preliminary examples . <h> Hybrid forecasting to project fatalities <p> Our team used a publicly available epidemic forecasting platform to look at how the effectiveness of COVID-19 responses can influence projections of the infection rate and fatalities in United States , Australia , Bangladesh and China . <p> These projections are worked out by minimising the difference between the number of confirmed fatalities and those predicted by an epidemic model for a given period of time , which takes into account factors such as how contagious COVID-19 is ( the reproduction number : R0 ) and how effective counter COVID-19 measures are ( quantified as percentages ) . <p> Figure 3 : The research looked at the effectiveness of COVID-19 responses on the infection rate and fatalities in United States , Australia , Bangladesh and China . Graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States ( on panel A ) could rise from around 92,000 ( the dashed grey line ) to 220,000 ( the solid grey line ) if the counter measures are relaxed by only 10 per cent . <p> To give this some context , we also looked at the seasonal hazard curves alongside COVID-19 projection curves . Seasonal natural hazards -- like floods , hurricanes and tropical cyclones , heat waves , wildfires and tornadoes -- have the potential to exacerbate the impact of COVID-19 . <p> The overall probability of these natural hazards occurring in the United States , Bangladesh and China actually increases over the next few months , while here in Australia , their probability diminishes over the same period . <p> So , during the Northern hemisphere 's summer , countries like the US , Bangladesh , and China are particularly exposed to compound risks of the pandemic and natural disasters . <h> The timing of natural hazards <p> Using a simple epidemic model , we investigated the impact of the timing of a potential natural disaster on the daily new infection rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to " flatten " in order to manage the demand on health care services . Early analysis shows that these interventions have substantially curtailed the demand on health services to date . <p> Figure 4 , : The blue curve illustrates a background daily infection rate before any intervention , the red curve is the infection rate with flattening measures . Graphic : Supplied <p> In the Figure 4 , the blue curve illustrates a typical background daily infection rate before any intervention and the red curve is the infection rate with flattening measures in full force . <p> We then introduced an external event , like a natural disaster , to the flattened curve . <p> Our team introduced this event on either side of the infection rate peak ( before the peak in the left column and after peak in the right ) . We also assume a COVID-19 incubation period of five days and that flattening measures can be fully re-enforced after a specified number of days ( days , 7 and 21 used here ) following the hazard . <p> The infection rate curve with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which shows an increase in infection rate above the flattened curve to varying degrees . <p> This experiment provides two important insights . <p> The first is that the increase in infection rate is greater for events occurring in the pre-peak period than the post-peak period . The second is that the infection rate increases with the time it takes to fully re-introduce social distancing measures . <p> While these two modelling examples have uncertainties , they emphasise the multidimensional nature of decisions that have to be made for COVID-19 counter measures to be effective during natural disasters . <p> There was an apparent increase in the rate of infections in the days following the earthquake in Zagreb . Picture : Getty Images <h> COVID-19 strategies <p> In the absence of a vaccine , projections of COVID-19 transmission indicate that the current crisis will be a protracted one . <p> But there are four pre-emptive strategies that governments can adopt to counter the compound risks of COVID-19 and natural hazards . <p> Thirdly , a re-design of policy responses is needed to address different natural hazards with a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide range of post-disaster activities , ranging from emergency aid distribution to providing shelter . <p> Finally , supporting relief agencies serving lower income communities or regions and their governments is important as impacts of compound effects on these areas are likely to be disproportionately high . <p> While the primary focus of many governments is on managing the COVID-19 crisis , planning for potentially concurrent natural disasters is also crucial to ensure communities are adequately prepared for the complexities that could arise from overlapping crises . <h> Privacy Statement <p> The University of Melbourne ( University ) collects , uses , handles and discloses personal information in accordance with the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 ( Vic ) ( Act ) and other applicable legislation . <p> This Privacy Statement relates only to the collection of personal information in relation to the Pursuit Website .

Along with the problem of being short-staffed , PMC has also been struggling to find space to accommodate the increasing caseload . <p> PMC has more than 72 various hospitals and clinics under it across the city . Huge buildings are being constructed for dedicated medical facility and amenity spaces are also being reserved for the purpose . However , many of these new facilities are being used for other purposes . <p> Only the ground floor of Tharkude Hospital in Erandwane has a functional OPD ; PIC : NIKHIL GHORPADE <p> For instance , there is a two-storey Tharkude Hospital in Erandwane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional on the ground floor , the second floor has been dedicated for a training centre for nursing care . Meanwhile , space on the back of the building is being used by a private organisation as their office . <p> The condition at Kotnis Hospital in Shukrawar Peth is no different . While the ground floor of this centre is being utilised for a gynaecology clinic , the first floor is lying completely unused and is locked . The space has not been cleaned for a while . The space on the second floor has been given to a senior citizens ' centre . Meanwhile , the parking space in the basement has become a dumping ground for construction material . <p> Similar scenes were witnessed in Dalvi Hospital in Shivajinagar which is being converted by PMC to be a maternity facility for COVID-19 patients . While the ground floor does have necessary facilities , the rooms on the third floor of the building have been converted into residential quarters for the PMC health department staff who have been residing there from more than a year . <p> Apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kothrud has not been utilised as it was intended as well . While the first floor houses the OPD and other medical facilities , two other floors are being converted into a school for the hearing impaired .

PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad stated that it seems to have been a trend that PMC constructs a facility which later gets utilised for other purpose by private or social organisations . Gaikwad said , " The authorities never appointed expert staff like gynaecologists , paediatricians . Since there were no appointments , they could not start the facility and in turn ended up renting it out . We have now issued advertisements for their appointments . Meanwhile , with the help of private players , we have tried improving the situation as well . We have built 10 intensive care units in this time of crisis .

@@71917741 <h> Tackling future Covids : Three things India needs to learn from China <p> We have an excellent disaster preparedness machinery . But it 's time to have a disease preparedness system as well . <p> Employees are back at work at the construction site of the Wuhan Greenland Center , a 636-m high skyscraper in Wuhan in China 's central Hubei province . ( AFP ) <p> China 's approach to containing the spread of the coronavirus has been called many things , many contradictory things . Just for instance , the strict lockdown and aggressive social distancing measures have been termed draconian ; at the same time , the measures adopted in Wuhan , which were nothing but lockdown and social distancing , have been called effective as well . So when we in India look at how China wrested control over the coronavirus outbreak , we do so in part admiration at Beijing 's ruthless efficiency , and part alarm at the disregard for citizen liberties . <p> While ideological differences over civil liberties will always separate India and China , New Delhi would do well to look hard at the measures enforced by Beijing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters into a key phase of its own battle against the novel coronavirus nCoV19 , it would benefit immensely from the insights available from the Chinese experience . <p> The most important of such insights would be that China did not win its battle with one fell blow . If one became aware of the coronavirus outbreak only when China employed all its state power to quarantine Wuhan and no less than 12 neighbouring cities , one might be misled into believing that one sledgehammer blow was all that it took to gain an upper hand on the epidemic . In fact , China did not use one single measure or policy : it adopted multifaceted and calibrated containment tactics based on an epidemic combat strategy finessed over 15 years . <p> Here are three things that China did that we can learn from as we go into the most crucial phase of the coronavirus epidemic in India . <p> 1 . Nationwide disease surveillance infrastructure <p> In China , measures to detect vicious outbreaks such as Covid-19 were put in place right after the SARS outbreak in 2003 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early as 2004 . Called the Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System ( NIDRIS ) , it is a web-based system for health facilities to report , in real time , individual case information of 39 notifiable infectious diseases . The NIDRIS system tracks approximately 5 million cases each year . The database connects hospitals and clinics at the prefecture , county , provincial and national levels , allowing the China Centre for Disease Control ( CDC ) to monitor an outbreak at every level . <p> Besides incidence reporting , China 's surveillance infrastructure includes an early warning system to detect the unusual occurrence of 33 infectious diseases . Set up by the WHO and China CDC in 2008 , the China Infectious Disease Automated-alert and Response System ( CIDARS ) facilitates the transmission of surveillance data in real time or on a daily basis . The 33 diseases in CIDARS are classified as Type 1 ( high severity but low incidence ) or Type 2 ( common infectious diseases ) . CIDARS tracks diseases that are outbreak-prone and transmits information about any abnormal signals to the CDCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four components : aberration detection , signal generation , signal dissemination and signal response information feedback . <p> How does this system work ? Since lower respiratory infections including pneumonia are one of the main causes of death worldwide , all Chinese healthcare facilities are required to report any patient who has a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown etiology and meets the following criteria : fever &gt;= 38 degrees C ; radiological characteristics of pneumonia ; normal or reduced leucocyte count or low lymphocyte count ; no improvement/worsening of patient 's condition for first 3-5 days ; and the pneumonia can not be attributed to alternative laboratory or clinical diagnosis . <p> After a case is registered in NIDRIS , the data can be further analysed in CIDARS as a Type 1 disease . Early alert signals are sent out when the number of cases exceeds the threshold for each infection . The thresholds for each disease are recommended by China CDC . Early warnings in the form of real-time SMSs are followed by a field investigation to rule out avian influenza , SARS and MERS . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all epidemic staff at CDCs at the national , provincial , city and county levels . <p> It may be true that in spite of having the infrastructure outlined above , China was slow to respond when the Wuhan outbreak happened . In fact , several studies of China 's disease surveillance infrastructure point out that although physicians are required to report pneumonia of unknown etiology , there is evidence of under-reporting . However , the purpose of the system is to detect clusters of pneumonia that indicate an outbreak . It gives the administration a better chance to react fast . <p> In contrast , India 's disease surveillance infrastructure is coordinated through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme ( IDSP ) but is beset with limitations . According to a roundtable discussion between healthcare experts organised by Carnegie India in December 2019 , the disease surveillance infrastructure model in India lacks uniformity of case definitions , standards and practices at the state and national levels . Also , there was a lack of coordination among competing organisations that resulted in ineffective disease mapping . Additionally , a research article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data on infectious disease burden in India . <p> In any scenario , there is consensus on what ought to be India 's biggest learning from the coronavirus experience : invest heavily in disease surveillance at all levels . <p> 2 . Contact tracing <p> In the current coronavirus crisis , digital surveillance and data analytics have emerged as important tools in epidemic control . China was fortunate in this matter , and gained time by turning to the massive amounts of data collected by companies like Tencent and Alibaba to perform contact tracing . These companies actually have a better idea of population and migration patterns than the Chinese government . Leveraging this data enabled orderly contact tracing of infected citizens and at-risk individuals . <p> On the other hand , many countries battling the coronavirus have given up on contact tracing fairly quickly although it is an effective , inexpensive and very basic public health intervention , compared to policies like social distancing , which have great economic costs . <p> Measures to trace the location and movement of millions of mobile phone users were put into place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alibaba and Tencent . For instance , Ant Financial 's QR code system assigns users one of three colors -- green , yellow or red -- based on the user 's basic healthcare information , travel history and location . The close-contact detector apps use big data from public authorities about train and air travel history and disease case records to check if the user has been in contact with an infected person . A green code permits freedom of movement , while yellow and red indicate that the user must self-quarantine or enter supervised quarantine . The right of admission into cafes , malls and other establishments is conditional on what code you have been assigned at that moment . <p> 3 . Mobility Controls <p> Beijing 's initial response to the Wuhan outbreak is being questioned but the agility of its action in that city in the third week of January is widely acknowledged . After more than 100 cases were detected on January 21 , mobility controls were announced in Wuhan on January 23 : the airport was closed ; bus , subway and train services were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . The lockdown measures were put in place days before the Chinese New Year holiday , when millions of people travel around and out of the country . By 24 January , travel restrictions were extended to 12 prefecture-level cities in Hubei . <p> In a study published in the journal Science , researchers estimated that the lockdown and mobility controls prevented 700,000 additional coronavirus cases and gave 130 cities extra time ( 3-5 days ) to prepare for the outbreak . The scale and agility of the lockdown involving 60 million people in Hubei has been the subject of much awe , but mobility controls went beyond a lockdown . <p> Keeping people indoors meant supplying supermarkets and stores with enough food to ensure people did n't have to leave their homes . In India , we have witnessed the exodus of millions of migrant labourers shortly after a lockdown was announced because they were not assured of food , residence and essential services in the cities . Anticipating that people would hoard food items and venture out of their homes in search of essentials , the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubei . <p> The city of Shouguang , in Shandong , is the country 's most important hub for growing , trading and shipping vegetables . The city is critical to China 's food production and distribution , so much so that the daily benchmark of national produce costs is called the China Shouguang Vegetable Price Index . Shouguang produces 4.5 million tonnes of vegetables every year and even more produce moves through its wholesale markets to reach other parts of China . Shouguang activated emergency plans to continue producing and delivering vegetables into Wuhan after it was asked to deliver 600 tonnes of fresh vegetables to Wuhan everyday for two weeks starting on 29 January . Officials also coordinated with provinces around Hubei to amass a reserve of 60,000 tonnes of vegetables and readied 10,000 tonnes of frozen pork in Shanghai that could be sent to Wuhan anytime . To facilitate the distribution of fresh produce , the government exempted food delivery trucks from travel restrictions and cracked down on price gouging at supermarkets in Wuhan . <p> The author is a China scholar and former research officer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@71920441 <p> A sanitation worker who was assigned to work in Dharavi recently tested positive for the novel coronavirus . He , inadvertently ended up passing it on to his wife who died on April 12 . Like most other urban poor families in metropolitans like Mumbai , his family did not have adequate residential space that allowed for physical and social distancing . <p> This case has raised concerns around the lives of the sanitation workers during the pandemic . And the " social distance " of class and caste has ensured that these concerns do not linger for long . Sanitation workers come under the essential services category . The government seems to have hung a death warrant around the necks of sanitation workers by sending them to the frontlines to fight the coronavirus . <p> Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a directive saying that sanitation workers in hospitals and other places should be provided with personal protective equipment ( PPE 's ) . But the question remains : how far are these directives being followed ? <p> In Madhya Pradesh 's Panna district , a local activist on March 9 , asked the District Collectorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an urgent basis given the current pandemic . <p> After a few days , he received a call from the Collectorate office informing him that the state of Madhya Pradesh currently did not have an " Urban Development and Housing Minister " and therefore , the state government was not sending any money across for the procurement of protective equipment . Just as sewer deaths have proven time and again , the pandemic has not managed to nudge the apathy of political leaders and administrations . <p> Sunil Yadav , a sanitation worker and a PhD fellow from TISS , said , " Everyday sanitation workers get exposed to deadly trash but no special training or guidance is provided to them on how to handle trash . " According to the New England Journal of Medicinestudy , the coronavirus can survive on plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 hours , and on cardboard for up to 24 hours . Nobody knows what kind of waste material is disposed off in dustbins and trash bags . <p> In India , trash is not segregated -- everything is mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitation workers encounter sanitary pads , expired medicines and broken glasses in trash bags . Lack of protective gear makes sanitation work difficult during normal times . During a pandemic , these factors make them far more susceptible to the virus . <p> A local activist from Panna district of MP said , " Our people are facing the coronavirus pandemic with courage , but there is always a fear in their minds : what if I get infected with the coronavirus ? Who will take care of my family and children ? Who will feed them ? " <p> So , despite being at the frontlines , sanitation workers are still at the bottom of our priorities . A few days back , the Delhi chief minister 's office tweeted , " Doctors are on the frontlines of the battle against coronavirus . All doctors serving in Delhi government 's Lok Nayak Hospital and GB Pant Hospital on COVID-19 duty will now be housed in Hotel Lalit . " <p> Similarly , the Uttar Pradesh government has taken over four five-star hotels -- Hyatt Regency , Lemon Tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . In Mumbai , Taj Hotel , Colaba and Taj Lands End , Bandra were opened for doctors and other health workers . But for corporates and political leaders , sanitation workers hardly ever count as frontline workers . It bears testament , yet again , as to how caste and class continue to shape our public policy , blinding it to the issues of some while focusing on others . <p> When I asked Sunil Yadav , who is an essential worker during the pandemic , what had changed for sanitation workers , he said , " Nothing , nobody cares . Here in Mumbai , sanitation workers travel three to four hours to reach their working place , nobody arranged transportation for us as they did for the doctors and other medical staff . " <p> Renudevi used to work as a maid before the lockdown in Dehri , Bihar . Her husband works as a sanitation worker in a hospital and earns Rs 7,500 per month . Every day , her husband carries an extra pair of clothes to wear at the hospital . The hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gears . <p> A legacy of exclusion <p> Poverty makes Dalits more vulnerable and helpless during such times of sustained lockdowns . Shivshankar is a father of five daughters and two sons . He used to work at a hotel in Dhanbad as a cleaner . His wife Rekha is also a cleaner working in the houses of upper-caste Hindu and rich Muslim families . His elder son Virkumar also works as a sanitation worker on contract . They earn Rs 7,000 , Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000 per month respectively . But since the lockdown , they have all been left without a job . Shivshankar does n't have money and the PDS ration is far from enough for his family . <p> The problem faced by sanitation workers like Shivshankar are in the worst condition during this lockdown compared to those working for government institutions as the latter at least have work . He added , " Jab sab theek tha tab to kuchh mila nahi , ab kya milega ? Ab to sarkar se koi ummeed nahi rakhte hai ( During normal days we received nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hope from the government ) " . <p> When asked why Yadav did n't take any help from his employer , he said , " I ca n't ask my employer to provide me with food or give me a salary in an advance . I know them personally . Nobody will help me because I am a Basfor . " Basfor is a sub-caste that is considered even lower than the Valmikis in the Brahminical order of caste . <p> Caste and coronavirus <p> The novel coronavirus is detrimental to the human race but the unplanned lockdown is detrimental for poor families . And as it happens , both are disproportionately affecting Dalits . <p> Sanitation workers today need Personal Protection Equipment ( PPEs ) , minimum wages , food , insurance , accommodation and transportation like other health workers , mechanisation of the work and solidarity . But instead , most are satisfied with just the clanging of empty vessels as if to celebrate our collective failure . <p> The caste system continues to " reserve " sewer and sanitation work for Dalits be it is Brihanmumbai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , around 30,000 sanitation workers are employed by the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation and all 30,000 are Dalits . Estimates say that 40-60% of the six million households of Dalit sub-castes are engaged in sanitation work . <p> The casteist apathy continues and has , in fact , been amplified in the face of the coronavirus pandemic . When municipal workers expressed the need for sanitisers , given the nature of their work in the national capital , they were provided with fluorescent jackets so that they can be identified as ' essential ' workers from a distance . Sooner or later scientists will develop a vaccine for the coronavirus , but as a society , we are far from confronting the viral casteism that continues to determine the fate of millions over generations . <p> " Sab log corona ke dar se ghar me hai , hum to yaha pe usise ladh rahe hai firbhi humari koi kadar nahi hai ( Everybody is at home because of coronavirus , but we are here fighting it . Even then , there is no appreciation ) " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much like Ambedkar lamented in front of Gandhi decades back , it is for us to ponder if Radharani has a homeland -- one that cares ? <p> Hundreds of crores were spent to welcome the US President in February but the government is unable to provide proper protective gears to sanitation workers during this pandemic because in India the cheapest product is the life of a Dalit.

@@71921441 <h> EXPLAINER : ABS-CBN shutdown has color of legality . But NTC spurns sense of Congress , its word to legislators on pending franchises . <p> SOME explanation on seven core points in the current controversy on a non-coronavirus issue : <p> 1 NTC 'S LEGAL BASIS . The Radio Control Law ( Act #3846 ) that the National Telecommunication Commission ( NTC ) cites in its May 5 cease-and-desist order against ABS-CBN says anyone operating a radio transmitting station or radio receiving station used for commercial purposes , or a radio broadcasting station , must have first obtained a franchise for it from Congress . <p> Since ABS-CBN 's 25-year franchise to operate its TV and radio broadcasting stations , Republic Act #7966 already expired on May 4 , it " no longer has a valid and subsisting congressional franchise " as required by the Radio Control Law . <p> 2 ABS-CBN REPLY TO NTC LEGAL ARGUMENT . A Senate resolution ( #40 ) and a letter from the House committee on franchise expressly asked NTC to allow ABS-CBN to operate while the bills seeking renewal of its franchise are still pending . NTC chief Emmanuel Cordoba , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said at the Senate committee hearing the agency would give the network provisional authority . <p> 3 WHAT NTC DID IN EFFECT . NTC ( a ) spurned the intent of Congress , ( b ) reneged on its promise made under oath before senators , ( c ) shunned the written guidance of DOJ chief Guevarra in favor of the legal view of Solicitor General Jose Calida , who has a pending quo warranto case before the Supreme Court against ABS-CBN , and ( d ) overturned past s <p> practice and many precedents in which broadcast stations similarly situated as ABS-CBN were allowed to continue to operate pending congressional decision . <p> Whatever NTC 's accountability to Congress may be taken up by the legislators . But NTC primarily answers to the president although Congress has oversight function over it . <p> But why NTC defer to Congress and honor its word to the legislators ? Ultimately , it is Congress that decides whether to grant the franchise . By rejecting the request for time to act on the renewal bills , NTC in effect assumed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues the provisional license . <p> 4 WHY ABS-CBN SUSPENDED OPERATIONS . It did not seek and wait for a court relief against NTC and instead the network suspended broadcasts at 8 p.m . Tuesday , May 5 . Probably it knew a TRO could not be secured quickly enough or it thought quick compliance , by taking itself off the air , would dramatically focus on ( a ) the termination of the news and entertainment service and ( b ) the loss of jobs for 11,000 employees ( ABS-CBN figure ) . Good public-relations timing during the period of emergency . <p> DOJ chief Guevarra had also advised for a judicial review instead of an ABS-CBN appeal to the authorities . <p> 5 CAUSE OF CONFUSION ON MOVE OF GOVERNMENT . As early as February 27 , the public thought President Duterte 's administration was already inclined to grant the new lease on ABS-CBN 's life . A comment by Terry Ridon , a former congressman and member of the franchise committee , noted that " the entire Duterte establishment , except Congress , has already endorsed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly supporting the renewal for the sake of the ABS-CBN employees . " He cited Senator Bong Go and Davao City Mayor and president 's daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio . <p> As to Congress , Speaker Allan Peter Cayetano promised a fair hearing and continued broadcasts by the network until Congress would vote on the issue . <p> Congress , whom Ridon deemed as part of the " Duterte establishment , " expectedly did n't like NTC to walk back on its stand and spoil its wish to grant the hearing without suspending network business . <p> 6 PRESIDENT DUTERTE 'S PART . Malaca ? ang has said the president had nothing to do with the NTC move . The president last February 26 accepted ABS-CBN 's public apology for its lapses or offenses during the 2016 presidential campaign . Did that apology wipe out the slate and the wish to get even ? <p> Critics point out that the NTC would n't have taken the move on such a sensitive issue without some " guidance " from the president or those close to him . Publicly , the president told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " according to their conscience . " But the private signals could be different , the critics say . <p> Now NTC is taking the beating from the public that 's critical of ABS-CBN and sectors of Congress that are insulted by the agency 's turnaround . That still does n't shed clarity on that aspect of the controversy . <p> 7 HOW MUCH LOSS ABS-CBN 'S SHUTDOWN WOULD CAUSE . Aside from the loss of income of individuals working for the network and their families , the network would get a severe beating in lost revenue , as well as subcontractors , suppliers and other smaller businesses depending on the operations of ABS-CBN . <p> How about loss of a major source of entertainment , news and information to millions of Filipinos ? A lot , although network critics say the broadcast industry has rival stations competing for audiences . ABS-CBN itself can still provide similar service , in a reduced scale , through its radio stations , cable news stations , and news sites that use digital platforms . <p> Internet media is not covered by congressional franchise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the padlocked network , it is material aired digitally , without using the air-lanes for which the government requires permission . <p> You might continue to watch the favorite soap dramas that you feared would vanish with ABS-CBN 's exit . <p> SunStar website welcomes friendly debate , but comments posted on this site do not necessarily reflect the views of the SunStar management and its affiliates .

@@71924441 <p> The nationwide lockdown posed a grim reality for the working class population , especially those who come under the informal sector and depend on daily wages . I intend to highlight an aspect of which I came across this morning . <p> There is an Amma Canteen situated a little distance from my place which serves the locality of Kandanchavadi in Chennai . I have seen thin to moderate crowds in the canteen since the day it was opened a couple of years ago . But today , during one of my essential trips to the grocery shop during this time of lockdown , I witnessed a large crowd gathered outside the canteen . <p> It was a little surprising for me , as I used to pass by this place and till date I had never seen a crowd like this . That said , people were standing patiently in a well organised queue , maintaining distance . <p> It was well beyond 9 in the morning but I was curious and decided to initiate a conversation with someone who was just exiting the canteen after finishing his breakfast . <p> Vanakkam I said , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized that he does n't understand Tamil . He was a migrant labourer from Bihar working in the construction of the World Trade Centre tower nearby . <p> I 'd studied in Delhi and knew basic Hindi , because of which I was able to have a conversation in a language we both understand ( much to his surprise ) . <p> He told me that he was forced out of work due to the sudden lockdown imposed by the Government as the construction of the towers came to a halt . There were many like him who did n't have the means to return back home and decided to stay back here ( sealed borders and the suspension of public transport including trains played a role ) . <p> They were fortunate to have these Amma Canteens which have been a lifesaver for people like him who depend on the food served here daily since the lockdown was imposed . My conversation with him ended there after he received a phone call , probably from his family back home in Bihar . I 'd forgotten to ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the conversation , which seemed incomplete . I had a lot of questions on my mind . <p> I remember watching a news report on a TV channel where a reporter on the spot was witness to people walking home in large numbers . Sticking a mike in the face of a migrant worker walking back to his hometown from New Delhi , the reporter asked why - when there was a strict nationwide lockdown - was there a need to walk such a large distance back home ? <p> The migrant worker exclaimed : " I 'd rather die of the disease than hunger " . <p> And hence , the ever so important question of providing food to the marginalized in times of a crisis like this comes up . It is perhaps too late for governments to realize now that the availability of food to the poor in times of crisis should be the priority if they really want to practice total lockdown in its truest terms . <p> What prompts these long journeys on foot ? The scenario is going to be the same once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or money . But at least the thought of getting food will provide some relief ( thanks to their local PDS ration cards which can guarantee them rations at subsidized rates ) , and perhaps - a network of family that will help each other get by . <p> But for those still stuck in cities , Amma Canteens provide respite - as they serve food to the urban poor - the working class and daily wage employees who have been left without work , shelter or food because of the lockdown . <p> It is worth noting here that the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu , J.Jayalalithaa had stormed back to power in the 2011 Assembly Elections thanks to her populist schemes such as the Amma Unavagam ( Amma Canteen ) . This initiative secured her the support of daily wage earners as they were the biggest benefactors of this scheme . <p> The Amma Unavagam promised Idly for ? 1 , Pongal ( Khichdi ) for ? 5 , Sambar rice , Lemon rice for ? 5 and Curd rice for ? 3 . And till date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The scheme had become so popular that many of the State Governments started to take a serious note of it . The Congress government in Karnataka ( 2013 ) was quick to follow and came up with Indira Canteen with the same concept of serving subsidized food to the poor and soon enough the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh also implemented the same idea in their states with different names . <p> In fact the CM of Tamil Nadu , Mr. Palanisamy in his recent presser claimed that his government is ready to open more Canteens and serve meals to many more people , in light of the present scenario . It has been reported that there 's an increase of 30% of people eating at the Amma Unavagam during this period of lockdown . <p> I must say that the scheme of Amma Canteens is a boon to many people like the gentleman I met in the morning . Perhaps Jayalalithaa was a visionary and way ahead of her time by ensuring the opening up of Amma Canteens which now cater to people from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . And not to forget the Shiv Bhojan Thali which was started on a pilot basis in Maharashtra ( by the Uddhav Thackeray government ) with a price of ? 10 for a lunch thali . It has since then halved its price during this time of lockdown . <p> Amma Unavagam and many such canteens in other parts of the country have indeed become saviors for many in such tumultuous times .

Write to **28;2961;TOOLONG for more details . <p> The markets had closed their doors on Rohit Chavan , a fruit farmer , even before the COVID-19 lockdown . Rohit owns a 72-acre grape farm in Indapur , a municipal council in Pune district . With a degree in MSc ( Horticulture ) Rohit has always wanted to aid his father in farming . <p> Normally , the farmer exports black grapes to Europe and usually earns between Rs 110-115 per kg . After the export routes were closed , he had to turn to the domestic market . Here too , the demand was close to nothing . The best rate offered to him was not more than Rs 20/kg . <p> To harvest grapes to be sold for Rs 20/kg would mean incurring labour charges . Additional expenses . To leave the grapes unharvested would mean wasting the year 's efforts . Rohit was stuck between a rock and a hard place . <p> At this juncture , a 2017-18 research by the National Research Centre for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid . The study outlined how to turn grapes into raisins on the vines themselves . " Under the right weather conditions , it takes the grapes about 12-15 days to turn into raisins . I began working on the process on the 2nd of April and recently sold 10 tonnes of raisin , " Rohit tells The Better India ( TBI ) . <p> And the price ? A whopping Rs 250 per kg ! <h> Dry-on-Vine Method helping Grape Farmers in Maharashtra <p> Rohit Chavan . <p> The Dry-on-vine method has proved to be a boon for not just Rohit but many farmers in Pune , Nashik and Sangli . And the NRCG is helping farmers adopt this novel technique as opposed to incurring 100 per cent losses due to the rain and lockdown . Though these farmers always focus on fresh grapes , in these desperate times they are attempting to save their entire produce by turning them into green and black raisins . <p> So how does the process work ? To know the answer , TBI got in touch with Dr Anand Kumar Singh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agricultural Research ( ICAR ) . This is what he told us : <p> For the preparation of raisin on the vine , spray 15 ml of ethyl oleate + 25 g potassium carbonate per litre water . Spray it on the bunches of grapes . ( For a one-acre farm make a solution of 2.25-litre ethyl oleate and 3.75 kg potassium carbonate with 150 litres of water ) . <p> After 3 days , follow it with the second batch of spray but with reduced concentration ( 1.65-litre ethyl oleate and 2.70 kg potassium carbonate with 150-litre of water ) . <p> Depending upon the Gibberellic acid used during the berry development stage , if required , one more spray with a half dose on the 4th day . A spray of half-dose may be given on 6th day . <p> The application of ethyl oleate and potassium carbonate through spray on the vine converts fresh grapes to raisin with 16 per cent moisture within 12 to 14 days from the date of the first spray . <p> " These chemicals are not absorbed by the berries . Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dr Singh says . <h> The Result According to Grape Farmers : <p> Rohit harvested his raisins in about 12-15 days . He had such faith in the process that he had already told the vendors about the expected harvest and was able to sell them off quickly . " NRCG has suggested that I experiment on 100-200 vines . But I did it on 10 acres of my farm instead . I am so happy with the result that I will keep 15 acres of my grape farm for the dry-on-vine method for the next year . I have already taught it to four of my farmer friends , " he tells TBI . <p> Arun More , another grape farmer from Nashik was n't so confident . Although he has harvested the raisins on his farm , he is taking time to process and pack them .

This year , Maharashtra had a bountiful harvest and the major growers in the state , like Nashik , Pune and Satara had exported nearly 85,000 tonnes by 6 April . That 's when the market dropped completely . With no one to buy the grapes but with several thousand tonnes of the fruits still on the vines , farmers were in a soup , " says Dr Singh . <p> With losses mounting due to the lockdown , farmers like Rohit and More approached ICAR National Research Centre For Grapes for help . " I approached NRCG on the day the lockdown was imposed . Within the next two days , they had compiled videos , advisories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which chemicals are to be used , when and how to spray them . This increased my confidence in the system , " says More . <p> Dr Singh has already lost count of how many farmers have benefited from this method .

Due to this , its inventory in March doubled from the level of 10-14 days of stock that the company usually holds . The Bengaluru-headquartered firm 's CEO Sanjay Sharma tells Samreen Ahmad that despite the coronavirus crisis , MTR Foods is still hopeful of reaching the Rs 1,000-crore revenue milestone by the end of this year . The FMCG major will also focus significantly on leveraging e-commerce channels , going forward . Edited excerpts ... <p> How is MTR Foods running the show when most of the other branded packaged food products are not to be found in the market ? <p> We started acting early in the crisis as the company is held by Norwegian conglomerate Orkla and Covid-19 crisis had already hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-planning was already communicated to us by our European counterparts . So we had started working on a plan by March 10 . We started building up stocks . As compared to the average stock level of 10-14 days that we hold , we decided to hold an inventory for up to 30 days . The manufacturing cycle had already started working towards that . Currently , it has depleted to 10 days as demands has increased . <p> What are the major supply-chain challenges that MTR has experienced during the lockdown ? <p> We have faced a business-continuity issue . The first week of lockdown was all about trying to reset the entire system . Our suppliers who were giving us raw materials were not seen as food processing units . So , we had to request the government to recognise them as critical services . We had to restructure our entire plants and methods of working , such as slowing down our lines and ensuring that all sanitation and social distancing norms were being followed . Many workers had gone home because of Ugadi , a major festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back after arranging buses . We have paid 20-30 per cent more to secure trucks to transport our products . <p> What is the current capacity utilisation of MTR factories ? How are you looking to scale up ? <p> Currently our factories are working at 60 per cent capacity , with just 50 per cent of our workforce . We have a unit in Pune that is in the Red zone so for the past four weeks . It has been open only for two days . We have seven contract manufacturers in places like Indore and Guntur , which too are red zones so there have been major challenges to get these working . There 's an on-and-off impact whenever a new Covid-19 case is detected in areas near our warehouses or factories , which has disrupted the supply chain . <p> How is the company taking care of the health of its employees ? <p> To a large extent , the factories have been quarantined . No outside person can enter the factories , including suppliers . We are following strong sanitisation measures and have arranged transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are sanitised after every trip . The buses are 50 per cent occupied to avoid any contact . We keep a track of who has travelled in each bus and temperature checks are done . We are working in shifts and those in shift-one are not allowed to interact with those in the second shift . Also plants are sanitised after every shift . <p> On an average we do around 8-10 launches in a year . Even in the current year we have done two launches ( hyperlocal spices ) before the crisis hit us . Given the current situation , we have kept our innovations on hold at this point of time as we want to see what will be the new normal situation . The consumer life has significantly changed and needs such as convenience are being evoked as the workload in homes have increased . We have seen a lot of demand in basic spices and breakfast mixes . Interestingly , as sweets shops are shut , we are seeing a huge demand for gulab jamun mixes . <p> Will MTR Foods be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current crisis ? <p> We are currently over Rs 900 crore in terms of revenue and it would be possible to touch the Rs 1,000-crore milestone this year . If the situation stabilises fast and we are able to find an equilibrium between managing this crisis and managing the business supply chain , then I see no reason why we will not hit those numbers . <p> This is one of those events that will change the world substantially . E-commerce is going to come out in a significant way and it is going to be one of our top priorities that we will carry into the future . Our e-commerce sales almost doubled to four per cent in April as compared to last year as we tied up with companies such as Swiggy and Zomato to get our products delivered . Also , as eating out will reduce and consumption patterns will change , we will also have to align our business accordingly .
@@71928741 <h> INTERVIEW:BJP spokesperson says MSMEs first , package for others later <p> Friday , May 8 <p> By Adrija Chatterjee <p> NEW DELHI -- The government may wait for the industry cycle to restart to provide stimulus for most sectors , but the ball has been set rolling for small industries , said Gopal Krishna Agarwal , the national spokesperson on economic affairs for the ruling party . <p> " There are certain issues specific to MSMEs ( micro , small and medium enterprises ) with regard to their balance sheets being weak , so they can not rely only on credit stimulus package , " Agarwal told Cogencis in an interview . " The government 's thought process is MSMEs will need credit guarantees . " <p> Agarwal said fiscal stimulus for other sectors will be ineffective until the lockdown is lifted and economy opened up . <p> " Whenever the industry cycle restarts then only a fiscal stimulus will be effective and useful , " he said . <p> India has been under a lockdown since Mar 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus that has killed over 1,800 people and infected over 56,000 . The lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories shuttered and services hit , leading to a demand for fiscal stimulus . <p> Last month , MSME Minister Nitin Gadkari had said that a 1-trln-rupee relief package for the sector is awaiting approval of the Cabinet . <p> Agarwal said those who are demanding fiscal stimulus of 5-6% of GDP are ignoring the fact that the Reserve Bank of India and the government have already announced substantial packages . He said the consensus was that the fiscal stimulus will be over and above the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of GDP for the current financial year started April . <p> Below are the edited excerpts of the interview with Agarwal : <p> Q. What is the thinking of the government on providing a fiscal stimulus to the industry ? <p> A. A sectoral fiscal stimulus is not required till the industry opens up . Whenever the industry cycle restarts then only a fiscal stimulus will be effective and useful . Till the time the industry cycle opens up , the government 's approach of giving benefit to the common man through direct fund transfers are more effective and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sectoral package should come later . <p> How you define fiscal stimulus is complex . The government has already provided relief through Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan package and that can be considered as fiscal stimulus . If you say that only sectoral announcements of concessions or direct transfers for certain areas are stimulus , then that stimulus for certain sectors can wait till economy opens up . <p> Q. What kind of relief can we expect for small scale industry ? <p> A. The government is looking into the concerns of micro , small and medium enterprises and working on a package . There are certain issues specific to MSMEs with regard to their balance sheets being weak , so they can not rely only on credit stimulus package . They need certain support on that front , so their problems are being conveyed to the government , and they will look into that . The government is working on a package for MSMEs and the timeline will be discussed and decided by the government .

MSMEs are a big challenge because their balance sheets are not strong enough to tackle the impact of the current crisis . And , with their status of balance sheets it is not easy for them to avail credit . <p> Q. Many economists have called for a fiscal stimulus of up to 5% of GDP . What are your views ? <p> A. Those who are demanding a fiscal stimulus of 5% or 6% of GDP are completely ignoring the already announced package . The Reserve Bank of India has announced relaxations and package of around 8 trln rupees and the central government has announced a package consisting of direct fund transfers to the tune of 3 trln rupees , so it has already become 11 trln rupees , it is already more than 5% GDP . Before that , the government announced stimulus of around 1 trln rupees for health and pharmaceutical industries . These announcements are also part of the package . The fund , which has gone into these sectors should also be looked at as fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have announced a substantial amount in terms of fiscal stimulus and the fund going into the hands of the common man is also a stimulus because ultimately it will create demand and industry will be benefited . <p> A. The FRBM ( Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management ) Act allows deficit monetisation . How the government uses it legally or technically is for the government to decide . Ultimately all these instruments like borrowing , relaxation of fiscal deficit target are mechanisms for getting liquidity into government finances . The government is already doing that . What mechanism it uses is not much of concern . Ultimately what everybody 's concern is that the government should not cap its fiscal stimulus to the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of the GDP . That relaxation is required and there is consensus in government about that . <p> Q. What will be the impact of the lockdown on growth , and when do you see economic recovery ? <p> A.

@@71934841 <p> This week is going to be ugly . There 's no getting around that . Every negotiation starts at opposite ends of a spectrum , and the chasm between Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association is wide enough that as they navigate a return-to-play agreement to set the stage for the return of professional team sports in America , a fight is almost guaranteed . <p> Where these discussions go , and how the principals involved steer them , mark the most consequential moment for the sport since it barely averted a work stoppage in 2002 . The coronavirus pandemic is altering the world . Unemployment is historically high . The future is impossible to forecast . And Monday , as MLB owners rubber-stamped the league 's proposal that it intends to share with the union in a meeting Tuesday , the conversation focused on money . <p> What followed surprised no one . This is not how it had to go , but it was how it was always going to go , millionaires and billionaires pitted against one another in a game of chicken . Stake out a position . Refuse to budge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ticking clock forces its abandonment . When that happens , when the posturing abates , the ugliness will burn off like the morning fog and there will be hope for a deal -- for baseball . <h> Most hyped prospect ever for every team <p> Bryce Harper , Ken Griffey Jr . and Bo Jackson lived up to their billing . Todd Van Poppel and Gregg Jefferies ? Not so much . Here 's the one prospect we were sure would be your team 's next superstar.David Schoenfield <p> As the sport with the clearest path and greatest appetite to return , baseball has an opportunity to illustrate the importance of equitable , shared sacrifice , to be a model of togetherness amid division . All of that , of course , is merely talk -- admittedly naive , unquestionably hopeful , ignoring what 's of greater import than rich people being a little less rich : that if baseball does relaunch , it does so with the health and safety of players , managers , coaches and all those in its orbit in mind . That it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end , is neither words nor bluster . It needs substance , foresight , action . And over the next two weeks , as the season hangs in the balance , action there will be . It 's up to the leaders of both sides to decide what sort . <p> What is in the return-to-play proposal ? <p> In broad terms : <p> * A 50-50 split of revenue from the 2020 season <p> * An 82-game schedule instead of the standard 162 <p> * A mid-June " spring training " and early-July Opening Day <p> * A 14-team postseason rather than the typical 10 <p> * Games played in home stadiums where allowed <p> * Designated hitters in the American and National League <p> * Games against only divisional and regional opponents -- i.e. , AL West teams , for example , play AL West and NL West teams <p> * Expanded rosters from 26 to as many as 30 active players with a 20-man taxi squad of minor league players and prospects <p> There are certainly more details to the proposal , including vital ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize this is an initial proposal that serves as a starting point for any return-to-play scenario and will necessitate a rigorous back-and-forth with amendments galore before it satisfies both parties . <p> What was the players ' reaction to it ? <p> Was it that stupid a question ? <p> Yes . <p> Why ? <p> Because the first item -- the 50-50 revenue split -- is a non-starter for the players . <p> Before explaining , it 's essential to understand how revenue works in baseball . The NFL , NBA and NHL all have revenue splits . They also operate in salary-capped systems . Straight revenue splits , in which sport-related income is pooled and distributed according to formulas agreed upon in collective bargaining negotiations , historically have been the domain of capped systems . MLB operates with no salary cap . <p> In baseball , there are two streams of revenue : local and national . Local revenue includes television contracts , which range from around $20 million a year ( Miami Marlins ) to upward of $250 million ( Los Angeles Dodgers ) , and in-game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets , concessions and other gate-related income . Nearly half of local net revenue is pooled and shared . National revenue comes from television contracts for the postseason and games of the week , league-owned media entities ( MLB Advanced Media and MLB Network ) , licensing , merchandising and corporate sponsorships . All national revenue is shared equally . <h> Editor 's Picks <p> The pandemic has turned off the revenue spigot . Whether local revenue accounts for 40% of teams ' incoming cash or a cut in the 30s , as past reports have suggested , the prospect of going a full season without fans -- and potentially going fan-free , or at least fan-light , into the 2021 season -- is daunting for teams ' bottom lines . Because all 30 teams ' revenue streams differ , it is realistic to believe some teams will lose money playing games without fans this season . Already , multiple teams are planning layoffs or furloughs starting June 1 , according to sources . <p> Owners are looking to cut costs wherever they can -- and nothing costs more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March agreed to pay players on a prorated basis -- at 82 games , they would receive 50.6% of their expected 2020 salaries -- the owners believe that language in that agreement allows them to renegotiate player wages in the event of games with no fans in the stands . The players vehemently disagree . ( More on that later . ) <p> How bad for the players would a split actually be ? <p> Warning : This is going to be some very back-of-the-napkin math that attempts to estimate revenues . Ballparking revenues tends to be a fool 's errand . In short , a 50-50 split is a huge issue . But indulge me . It is more to make a point . <p> Forbes estimated that MLB 's industrywide revenues in 2019 were $10.7 billion . Club sources have suggested the number was lower but in that ballpark . Let 's use the higher number but use teams ' estimate that 40% of local revenue will vanish without ticket sales . That leaves $6.4 billion . <h> Would a baseball card lie ? <p> Sources have estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $2.5 billion range annually . Because teams under this plan would play only half the games , that 's half the revenue -- say , another $1.2 billion haircut . And that does not account for regional sports networks , which pay local TV-rights fees , potentially asking for a discount based on the difference in the product , whether it 's because there are no fans in the stands or because teams are forced to play away from home thanks to local government regulations . Ignoring that possibility , we 're down to $5.2 billion . <p> National TV money is estimated at $1.7 billion a year . The point of implementing expanded playoffs would be to maintain that number , with the loss of half the Sunday Night Baseball games and the expected cancellation of the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby in Los Angeles . In the current system , MLB 's guaranteed number of playoff games is 26 , and its maximum is 43 . Expanded playoffs would swell those numbers to 36 and 59 . That translates to hundreds of millions of extra dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low-$5 billion range . <p> Losses in other areas are almost a given , dropping revenue under $5 billion . Which , admittedly , still seems high , especially if owners are claiming they could lose money this year . Still , it makes the prospect of a 50-50 split with players interesting financially . Player salaries for 2020 are estimated somewhere between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion . Let 's go with $4.3 billion . At a prorated salary for 50.6% of the games , that 's around $2.18 billion . Half of , say , $4.8 billion would be $2.4 billion . <p> play <p> 1:43 <h> Why MLB players should accept proposal for shortened season <p> Mark Teixeira and Jeff Passan weigh in on the impending decision by the MLBPA on a proposed shortened 2020 season with a 50-50 revenue split between players and owners . <p> Could players really be guaranteed more money in a 50-50 split ? <p> It 's possible , sources said , but looking at it strictly from a revenue perspective ignores three issues critical to the union . <p> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system frightens players , even if this proposal does n't involve a salary ceiling or any other cap tenets . The mistrust between the sides has deepened in recent years -- just look at their different interpretations of that March agreement , which is barely six weeks old -- and the slightest whiff of a cap sends off Pandora 's box signals at the union . <p> 2 . Salaries do not grow commensurate with revenue gains . So now , in a year in which the game is struggling , it 's necessary for the players to share in the losses ? That 's not how it works . <p> 3 . If a second wave of the coronavirus were to strike before or during the postseason and force the cancellation of games , postseason TV money would vanish . Even if the estimated revenues were $5 billion , they would crater with the cancellation of playoff money and leave the players with less than their prorated share . <p> To really understand what the players think about the revenue-split idea , one needed only hear what MLBPA executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that restricts player pay based on revenues is a salary cap , period . This is not the first salary-cap proposal our union has received . It probably wo n't be the last . That the league is trying to take advantage of a global health crisis to get what they 've failed to achieve in the past -- and to anonymously negotiate through the media for the last several days -- suggests they know exactly how this will be received . None of this is beneficial to the process of finding a way for us to safely get back on the field and resume the 2020 season -- which continues to be our sole focus . " <p> Damn . <p> Yeah . MLB commissioner Rob Manfred had to expect some sort of response to the 50-50 split , but that was a response . <p> So say all the " Kumbaya " pabulum you were spouting earlier about peace and love and harmony does n't come to fruition because the impediment of money is intractable . What 's the worst-case scenario here ? <p> No season at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Turn back the clock 26 years , to 1994 , when MLB wanted to institute a salary cap . The union refused , and in August , it went on strike . Baseball lost a World Series because the league sought a salary cap and the players refused to budge . <p> Since then , baseball has seen 25 years of labor peace , the most since the union was founded in 1966 . <p> Hold on . You 're seriously saying they 'd lose a season over this ? <p> They could . In fact , for argument 's sake , let 's assume they do . What are the outcomes for each side ? <p> Players : <p> * They do n't get paid beyond the lump sum of $170 million negotiated in the March deal , a problematic issue for the surprising number of players who live paycheck to paycheck . <p> * They lose a year of playing , an item of immense value for those who understand baseball is a profession with a short career span . <p> * The free-agent market after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may dip into savings reserved for an emergency -- such as a potential work stoppage after the current collective bargaining agreement expires after the 2021 season . <p> * Agents , on whom players lean for counsel , do n't receive commissions -- and some accordingly are threatened with insolvency . <p> Owners : <p> * Their revenues shrivel to almost nothing . <p> * Mass firings and furloughs take place . <p> * Multiple bankruptcies are possible , if not likely , either prompting bailouts from MLB or forcing owners to sell . <p> * Franchise values , which have skyrocketed in recent years , plummet , because recovery from the financial hole created by a lost 2020 season could take years . <p> Whose outcome is worse ? <p> I 'm the one who asks the questions . <p> Sorry . <p> Whose outcome is worse ? <p> They are both absolutely terrible ! On one hand , the finite nature of players ' careers weighs very heavily . Owners tend to be in the game long term , and the recovery of the economy could eventually make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firings , furloughs , bankruptcies and plummeting values are like the Four Horsemen of the financial apocalypse . <h> MLB 's great debates <p> Is the Astros ' title forever tainted ? Is Jeter overrated ? We offer the final word on every team 's most burning question . Story <p> There is a principle of negotiation called BATNA -- best alternative to a negotiated agreement . When one side 's BATNA is better than the other 's , that side gains a significant advantage . If there is an advantage here , it 's not very big . Both sides ' alternatives feel positively ruinous . <p> And that 's not even taking into account the missed-opportunity cost of being the only team sport back during a time when fans are craving something to watch , as well as the narrative that would lay waste to the sport 's reputation and haunt it if money did , in fact , scuttle a season . <p> Major League Baseball : The sport that shut down during a global pandemic because it could n't figure out how to split up billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For one , union lawyers believe they 're in the right legally when it comes to guaranteeing players ' prorated salary . The March agreement contains a Player Compensation and Benefit section that does not specifically address a reduction in salary if games are played in front of no fans . <p> That said , on Page 1 of the agreement , the first point of the Resumption of Play section includes the words : " ( T ) he 2020 championship season shall not be commenced unless and until each of the following conditions is satisfied . " One of those conditions ends with : " ( T ) he Office of the Commissioner and Players Association will discuss in good faith the economic feasibility of playing games in the absence of spectators or at appropriate substitute neutral sites . " <p> The first sentence of the compensation section begins with the clause : " If and when the conditions exist for the commencement of the 2020 championship season ... " -- language similar to that on the first page . <p> When asked by ESPN to interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither MLB nor the union adopted different positions . Two said the similarity in the language made it clear that those sections were meant to be tied together . One agreed with the union 's interpretation that anything about compensation changing should have been written explicitly . The fourth called any potential grievance on the matter a toss-up . <h> MLB 's biggest one-hit wonders <p> For a single season , these players raised their game to levels they had never achieved before -- or would again . <p> Beyond the legal question , there is the matter of how it has been presented to players . Union leadership has been vociferous in saying players would be paid their full prorated salaries . Part of this could be strategic -- as a rallying point that a group of 1,200 players of different ages , races and homelands with differences in opinion will not be exploited by 30 billionaires . <p> The tack does come with hazards . Promising something like full prorated salaries takes away a potential negotiating chip . If Clark cedes any money to ownership , he runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is incentivized not to give up money , even though it 's clear that money is an imperative part of any deal . <p> Do the players have an argument for their full salaries that goes beyond the legal interpretation of the March agreement ? <p> Absolutely . They 're the ones who actually have to go out and work during a pandemic . Which is not to compare them to those who toil in hospitals or nursing homes or grocery stores . But it is to compare them to ... owners . Who most certainly do not have to travel on planes , stay in hotels or simply leave their homes . <p> How big of an issue is health and safety ? <p> It 's difficult to tell . If the players wanted to stay away from the compensation issue publicly and focus on health and safety altogether , it would be the easiest messaging win imaginable : " We want to play baseball , and we want to do so in the healthiest and safest way possible to protect our families , our more at-risk co-workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect playbook for this approach on Twitter after the details of MLB 's proposal surfaced . <h> ' Opening Day ' Power Rankings <p> Sure , the baseball season is in limbo , but that does n't mean we ca n't have Power Rankings . How does your team stack up ? Power Rankings <p> He asked about the frequency of testing and how non-players would be protected and whether there would be modifications to clubhouses . Any agreement , he said , needs " a proactive health plan focused on prevention and reactive plan aimed at containment . " Even though Doolittle , as a healthy 33-year-old , is not among those COVID-19 typically afflicts , his wife , Eireann Dolan , has asthma . As Doolittle said : " We need to consider what level of risk we 're willing to assume . " <p> For example : How do you deal with players who say they 're not interested in playing , whether because of preexisting conditions or family members whose health makes them more susceptible to COVID-19 or , very simply , because they are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance of infection ? <p> In addition to the actual health concerns , moral authority is up for grabs . If one side is the billionaires who want to save money and the other is the players who want to ensure that their families , older employees , outside workers and they themselves are as insulated from the coronavirus as possible , well , even the most dyed-in the-wool corporatist might have trouble maligning the players for focusing on that . If the sides ca n't come to an agreement , it 's an awfully hard sell for the league to suggest it did n't happen because ... the players wanted too much testing ? <p> It 's fairly clear what the league wants . How about the union ? <p> Fact is , the union members want their money too , and Clark saying as much did n't exactly bolster their ability to ride a health-and-safety platform . <p> Every year , MLB provides some financial information to the union . But in this case , with revenues so opaque , a clearer picture would give the players confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Considering how closely the league holds its finances , a robust audit would represent the sort of olive branch that could bring the sides together . <p> In terms of potential concessions , there are plenty . Service time remains a bugaboo . So does competitive balance . Maybe a change to free agency to encourage spending at a time when teams might be disincentivized to pursue players . The players could ask for more games so their prorated salary is higher . MLB 's proposal has most of the postseason in October , seemingly as a hedge against a potential second wave . The players could push for the playoffs to go deeper into November . <p> So are owners going to yield ? <p> Well , most of them did n't become billionaires by accident . Unless they have evolved overnight , they will push and cajole and hold out for the best deal , knowing that in the end , fans often side with teams over players . They can say that they 're losing money and want their workers ' salaries to reflect that , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if players already agreed in the March deal to a structure that will halve their salaries . <p> Then again , a truth underpins this entire negotiation : If ever there were a time for billionaire owners to do good -- not in paying players , per se , but in avoiding the catastrophic fallout of baseball adding to a national unemployment rate approaching 15% -- it 's now . And if ever there were a time for millionaire players to shed cynicism and adopt not a mien of war but one of mutually beneficial deal-making , it 's now . <p> You 're being naive and hopeful again . <p> Pretty much . <p> What 's the solution ? <p> For starters , maybe make Tuesday 's meeting not about a 50-50 split or any finances . Try to answer Doolittle 's questions and those posed thus far by other players . To emphasize the plan about how to restart a sport in the middle of a pandemic . The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon , and the sides could spend hours talking without mentioning dollars and cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burning of the morning fog is simply necessary . Get the wrong out of the way so a right can come of it . Or something like that . <p> There is no easy solution here . The pandemic can bring out the worst in baseball , expose all of its fragilities , if Manfred and Clark are n't careful . <p> So , uh , that solution ? <p> Oh yeah . Well , if cash-flow problems are that real for owners , players could defer a portion of their salaries with interest . While that does add debt that all 30 teams are trying to avoid , it would solve a short-term issue while showing a willingness to compromise . Yes , a deferral is technically a pay cut -- it is cutting pay now -- but remember : equitable , shared sacrifice . <p> As for owners , they can give service time more than lip service and stop the farcical manipulation they 've used as a tool to keep players from free agency for years . They can put levers in place to ensure free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . They can raise the minimum salary next year leading into the negotiations on a new agreement . <p> These are smart people . If they want , they can find a deal . They just have to be willing to look for it . <p> What comes after that ? <p> The league figures out how many governors are on board with the idea of empty-stadium baseball returning in their state -- and , less comfortably , of teams from their geographical area of the country coming into town to visit . Manfred , sources told ESPN , has called governors around the country to lobby for MLB 's return in home stadiums . Ohio Gov . Mike DeWine and Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan both told ESPN they have spoken with Manfred but declined to characterize their conversations . <h> Arenado : ' I miss baseball every day ' <p> The Rockies star shares what his game days were like , but how he has to spend them now during a pandemic .

@@71940441 <p> In his ministerial statement on the economy , federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg confirmed that tax reform is being considered alongside a host of other economy-boosting measures such as infrastructure spending , skills programs and industrial relations reforms . <p> But of all the taxes imposed by governments , state and federal , one tax has emerged as the most ripe for reform : stamp duty . <p> A decade on from the Ken Henry tax review , which recommended stamp duty be abolished in favour of a broad-based land tax , state treasurers are mounting a fresh push to abolish the unpopular tax , which adds tens of thousands of dollars to the cost of buying a new home . <p> So what is stamp duty ? What are the alternatives ? And how likely is reform ? <p> Advertisement <h> What is stamp duty ? <p> For as long as governments have existed , they have needed to impose taxes to collect revenue . One of the earliest forms of taxation in Australia was stamp duty -- along with customs duties on imported goods and taxes on alcohol and tobacco . <p> The " stamp " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was imprinted on contracts and other documents to make them official .

Taxes on wages discourage workers from working . Taxes on company profits discourage investment and encourage companies to look offshore or to hire expensive accountants to help them minimise tax . <p> The trick is to impose taxes on things that ca n't really be avoided in face of the tax . <p> Advertisement <p> Stamp duty , by targeting people choosing to enter into new contracts and undertaking new transactions , fails this fundamental test . People can avoid the tax by not doing the transaction . <p> First-home buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are discouraged from downsizing , which would free up more housing supply and ease upward pressure on home prices . Workers are also discouraged from moving to where jobs are located , leading to higher unemployment . <p> Economists would like to see such inefficient taxes abolished in favour of other taxes that do less damage to the economy . <h> What are the alternatives ? <p> Abolishing stamp duty overnight would leave a huge hole in the finances of all state and territory governments . <p> So , if it is to be abolished , alternatives must be found . <p> The most commonly discussed methods of plugging the revenue hole left by stamp duty is either a broader land tax or an increase in the scope or amount of GST -- or some combination of all three . <p> Advertisement <p> The ACT government is the only state or territory government to have committed to abolishing stamp duty .

" This is not a mandate we have , nor plan to seek , " he said in response to Perrottet 's review last year . <p> But things have changed since then . <h> Is now a good time to scrap stamp duty ? <p> In the face of falling revenue , the federal government is being forced to consider what Australia 's tax system will look like in a COVID-19 world . <p> As it searches for ways to boost the economy , reforming taxes to be less of a drag on growth is one avenue being considered . <p> Political wisdom is that increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpopular . <p> But the imperative for growth and job creation is paramount . <p> According to Treasurer Perrottet : " There is no better time to rid the states of inefficient taxes that hold back economic growth .

@@71942541 <h> Donald Trump 's laughable excuse for the scale of US outbreak <p> Donald Trump has come up with a new excuse for the astonishing scale of his country 's coronavirus outbreak . <p> It 's not a good one . <p> " Do n't forget , we have more cases than anybody in the world . But why ? Because we do more testing , " Mr Trump told workers at a medical supply plant in Pennsylvania yesterday . <p> " When you test , you have a case . When you test , you find something is wrong with people . If we did n't do any testing we would have very few cases . <p> " They do n't want to write that . It 's just common sense . " <p> If we did n't do any testing we would have very few cases . <p> This is a stupid statement . It is not " controversial " or " bizarre " or " unconventional " , or any of the other words we traditionally use to sanitise the absurd things that come out of Mr Trump 's mouth with such depressing regularity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like saying that if you do n't use pregnancy tests , you 'll never have a baby . Or that if police stop investigating murders , the amount of crime will drop . <p> Or that if none of us had eyes , Mr Trump would no longer have an obvious spray tan . Picture : Evan Vucci/AP <p> If the United States tested fewer people , it would still have the same number of cases . The government would just have no idea where they were , and therefore no capacity to contain them . The virus would be allowed to spread undetected . <p> In the long run , of course , that would actually lead to more infections and more deaths . <p> It is exactly what happened in the US throughout the whole month of February . As government agencies bungled their response , and Mr Trump deluded himself into thinking the virus was no worse than the flu , there was a severe shortage of test kits . <p> America 's official numbers looked OK at that point . And then testing finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , as Mr Trump likes to call it , became a heck of a lot more visible . <p> By mid-March , after weeks spent dismissing concerns about the virus as " hysteria " and insisting cases were going " substantially down , not up " , Mr Trump was claiming he had " always known " it was a pandemic . He could no longer ignore the facts . <p> Now the US has 1.4 million confirmed cases of the virus , more than five times as many as Spain in second place . Its death toll is 87,000 , more than twice as bad as Britain 's . <p> That does n't prove testing is the problem . It proves the opposite - that the absence of testing leads to disaster . <p> Somehow , Mr Trump has failed to grasp this agonisingly obvious point , and has reached an entirely different conclusion . <p> " It could be the testing 's , frankly , overrated . Maybe it is overrated , " he said yesterday . <p> The fundamental problem here , or one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the number of reported cases , and how that number makes him look , than with the actual reality of how many Americans are infected with an illness that might kill them . <p> Cast your mind back to March , when he explained why he did n't want the passengers from a cruise ship anchored off San Francisco to be brought ashore and quarantined . Mr Trump said he liked " the numbers being where they are " . <p> " I do n't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that was n't our fault , " he said . <p> His logic was ridiculous . Any person with an appropriately ordered set of priorities knew it did n't actually matter whether the infected people were on the ship or locked up on dry land - either way , they were infected . <p> Mr Trump was worried about the optics of the official tally going up when he should have been worrying about the patients ' welfare . <p> The same thing is happening now , just on a greater scale . Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger America 's outbreak is than any other country 's . He expresses no frustration at the fact that America 's outbreak really is larger than any other country 's . <p> " Do n't those pesky reporters realise that if we did n't bother to look for infections , we would n't find any ? " he apparently tells himself , thinking it 's a clever point . <p> Some trusted adviser needs to whisper in Mr Trump 's ear that the US has more cases than anywhere else not because it tests more people , but because more of its people are infected . And as President , that is what he is supposed to care about . <p> It 's really quite simple . Picture : Carlos Barria/Pool via AP <p> Mr Trump clearly wants to be re-elected . Well , the surest way for an incumbent politician to win - particularly when a crisis hits - is for them to do their job well . <p> It is bewildering how often leaders fail to realise that , as obvious as it seems to the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out of failure when focusing on succeeding in the first place would actually be easier . <p> Instead of marketing America 's horrific coronavirus toll as best he can , or gambling on longshot miracle cures , or shifting the blame to the states , or fighting with reporters every day , Mr Trump should be exclusively fixated on limiting the virus 's spread . <p> If he had taken the pandemic seriously from the start and managed it competently , as our own government has , he would probably be coasting to re-election . <p> But no . He 's still distracted by nonsense . <p> Last month it was the brain fart about injecting people with disinfectant or bathing them in " very powerful light " . <p> Before that it was hydroxychloroquine , hailed as " one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine " and then quickly forgotten . <p> Now it 's the idea that testing is " overrated " because it makes the numbers look bad - which , of course , is exactly what they are . <p> Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reopen their economies , even though practically none of them are in a position to do so safely . <p> Guess what the first and most important prerequisite for easing restrictions is ? You should be familiar with it by now . Our own government 's medical experts mention it at every single media conference . <p> Testing ! Fast , widespread testing . That is what allows health officials to identify new outbreaks , conduct contact tracing and isolate anyone who has been exposed . <p> The quickest way for Mr Trump to accomplish his goal of reviving the economy is to preach the virtues of testing every time he 's in front of a camera , and to make his frequent boast that " anyone who wants a test can get a test " a reality instead of a blatant lie . <p> The US has made progress on that front . It passed 10 million tests this week , and is climbing up the global ranking of tests conducted per capita . <p> It still has a long way to go though .

These are tolerable , in the current circumstances . In other words , the normal human rights that we expect at times when there 's no such health emergency should be restricted if that 's necessary to deal with an emergency . <p> In his opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the anti-coronavirus measures introduced in the UK , especially if they were required by the best scientific advice , which Greer sees no reason to question . <p> As the UK Government specified from the beginning on its website , the measures in the Coronavirus Act 2020 are temporary . <p> The government in Azerbaijan launched a new wave of crackdown on political activists during the covid-19 outbreak . Mammad Mammadzada @mammadzadeh from @smdtemds tells us journalists and human rights defenders face bogus charges and attacks on social media . **26;198;TOOLONG <p> While the human rights organisations understand the necessity of containing the spread of the virus , they also committed to monitoring the action of the Government and stressed the need to focus on the categories of people who are already at risk even in normal conditions . <p> " These are extraordinary times , which require extraordinary measures . It is right the Government takes necessary and proportionate measures to prevent , treat and control the coronavirus , and human rights must be at the centre of its response . " <p> Allen 's opinion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Greer , everybody 's human rights are affected in a crisis like this . But some people are touched more severely than others . The trouble is , there 's no perfect human rights solution . <p> He conceded : <p> " Even in normal times , there are all kinds of compromises to be struck between human rights , and people may debate whether the balance has been struck in the right place or not . " <p> By closing workplaces , the UK Government also undertook to cover the salary costs and other expenses related to the lockdown . This makes the Professor think that the way it has reacted is broadly appropriate . At the same time , he admits he is not sure the measures are going to be adequate for that segment of the population who relies upon charity . <p> " There 's a big debate in this country about the adequacy of the benefits system for those kinds of people anyway and I suppose this crisis just makes that more acute , " Greer said . <p> In fact , the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in UK public debate . Despite coronavirus being defined as a " great leveller " by many politicians , figures show that some communities are suffering more than others . <p> In particular , people from black , Asian and minority ethnic ( BAME ) backgrounds appear to have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 virus . Even if they only represent the 14% of the UK population , their members affected by coronavirus account for 35% of the patients in intensive care . <p> ' This review needs to be independent , transparent , thorough and most importantly it needs to engage with the communities and individuals affected . ' <p> In the meantime , another instance of inequality has become clear : between the deprived and richest areas . People living in the poorest parts of England and Wales are dying at twice the rate of those in the richest areas . This has been revealed by an Office for National Statistics report focused on the period between 1 March and 17 April , 2020 . <p> Even in normal conditions , the human rights to various social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest attainable standards of physical and mental well-being are still unlikely to be easily enjoyed by groups like immigrants , asylum seekers , the homeless and others . <p> Professor Greer told IA : <p> In a developed Western society where there is no crisis , there will be all kinds of people who are vulnerable for all kinds of reasons . And when you 've got a crisis , those vulnerabilities tend to be accentuated . In other words , crises tend to impact much more upon the vulnerable than people who are not vulnerable . <p> A possible crucial " move " in this direction has been made on 3 May , when the Housing secretary Robert Jenrick announced a ? 76 million package to support groups more at risk during the coronavirus lockdown , including children experiencing dangerous situations , rough sleepers and victims of domestic and sexual violence , who will get ' priority need status ' for local housing . Besides this , the allocated resources would keep charity helplines funded and to recruit counsellors for the victims of abuses . <p> The future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responding . But what Professor Greer highlights about the reaction to the crisis is the prompt commitment shown by civil society . <p> He said : <p> One of the heartening features of this crisis is the way in which people have resorted to what you might call community-oriented self-help . I live in Bristol and in our streets , some people have gone around putting little notes through the door saying they 're organising volunteers to help and you can contact them on the email or on a mobile phone . So people are looking out for one another , that 's a good thing too , I think . <p> However , there are social groups which wo n't have experience community support : namely those in prison . " Quite a few people , myself included , think that we imprison too many people in this country .

" As far as prisoners are concerned , the main responsibility of the authorities is to do their best to ensure that the rest of their rights are as well-protected as possible , " he said . <p> However , prisons are not the easiest environment to safeguard persons within . <p> Professor Greer suggested : <p> Trying to maintain the two-metre distance , for example , is obviously going to be very
